Resumption of the session
Madam President, on a point of order.
Madam President, on a point of order.
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.
Why are there no fire instructions?
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced?
We do not know what is happening.
Agenda
Relating to Wednesday:
(Applause from the PSE Group)
We then put it to a vote.
There was a vote on this matter.
That was the decision.
There is no such document!
We have agreed to this.
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
Thank you, Mr Poettering.
It is not a lot to ask.
Thank you very much.
My vote was "in favour" .
There is no room for amendments.
That did not happen.
This is an important matter.
You did not call me either.
I would urge you to endorse this.
This is a pity, in a sense.
This, however, does not seem feasible.
The debate is closed.
Transport of dangerous goods by road
I thought that it was quite superb.
The debate is closed.
The consequences do not inspire hope.

We are badly behind now in this matter.
I find the opposite the case.
The debate is closed.
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.
What is the result?
We must give them this opportunity.
What is a fair society?
So much for the quality.
I agree with your analysis.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
Thank you very much, Mr Cox.
I understand what you are saying.
We have taken note of this.
Mr Wynn, that makes sense.
Mrs Ahern, we have taken note of this.
Thank you very much.
(The Minutes were approved)
Reform of European competition policy
It should continue along this path.
One is subsidiarity.
Thank you very much, Mr Radwan.
Should we not be discussing this issue?
When will we debate that?
They are still in training, as it were.
But opinion differs as to the solution.
This is unacceptable to my mind.
This is unacceptable in my view.
I consider this to be unacceptable.
I agree with this request.
With what aim?
Not to save jobs.
The form the aid takes is important.
But Europe is changing.
This is not in question.
Uniformity needs to be worked on.
We all agree on this.
There have only been nine rejections.
Here improvements should be made.
Many speakers have underlined this.
Why?
Is this simply a political gesture?
No.
The fourth group is legal certainty.
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.
The joint debate is closed.
We need to do something about it.
The question is: who prosecutes?
It is fine, in principle.
It need only be fine-tuned.
And indeed there is a twofold shift.
I do not believe so.
And what exactly should be done?
So, unification in this small area.
We need a public debate on this.
Nothing has changed there.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.

Oil slick off the French coast
Why not?
The time for resolutions has passed.
What is now needed is action.
I can testify to this remarkable work.
This is no longer tolerable.
Next, we have flags of convenience.
This is no longer tolerable.
This is no longer tolerable.
This must be brought forward.
And now the Erika.
And this is the result.
We know what actually happened.
The 15 clearly do not suffice.
Many thanks for this.
But this is not in place.
So what are we to do now?
What are we to do now?
This is what we need for ships.
However, we must stick to the facts.
I cannot accept this.
There are reputable companies too.
It could have sunk anywhere.
By now they are far away.
It is a miracle that they were saved.
States can carry out port inspections.
RINA is currently the talk of the town.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Ultimately, the polluter must pay.
The victims are waiting outside.
They want answers.
Who will provide us with new jobs?
But there is an art to that as well.
That is the reality.
We already have legislation.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Storms in Europe
Let me explain.
I can show you a copy if you wish.
Current programmes must be accelerated.
However, it has now achieved notoriety.
All this is well-intentioned advice.
This is wrong!
I say they have a right to solidarity.
This is an irreparable loss.
That is important.
It was very small.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Natural habitats were destroyed.
That concludes the debate.
Food safety
Over 80 measures are envisaged.
The first key concern is independence.
I also reject this line of argument.
This is a major task.
That is very much the right approach.
That cannot continue.

I also welcome the White Paper.
There may be a number of views on that.
It must be visible.
It must be known.
It must be visible.
That is my judgement at the moment.
That concludes the debate.
Question Time (Commission)
First Part
Question No 28 by (H-0781/99):
Thank you for your reply.
So much for the political aspect.
Now to the technical aspect.
In the case of Turkey it is different.
The plant is not yet there.
I do not have these concerns.
Question No 29 by (H-0786/99):
If not, why not?
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for your question.
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for that question.
That is also mentioned in the report.
I cannot answer that question.
Question No 30 by (H-0793/99):

I urge the Chinese again to do so.
Question No 31 by (H-0795/99):
Are these reports accurate?
The newspaper reports were misleading.
I wish you a good evening.
Second Part
Question No 33 by (H-0829/99):
That is naturally unacceptable.
This is not the usual state of affairs.
Question No 35 by (H-0778/99):
Thank you, Commissioner for your reply.
Did anyone find work?
What has been done about training?
Do we have any figures?
Question No 36 by (H-0782/99):
Of course it is as you say.
Question No 37 by (H-0791/99):
Question No 38 by (H-0805/99):
Question No 39 by (H-0807/99):
Question No 40 by (H-0808/99):
Question No 41 by (H-0813/99):
Question No 42 by (H-0817/99):
Question No 44 by (H-0819/99):
Question No 45 by (H-0006/00):
We congratulate you.
That concludes Question Time.
1997 discharge
This has now been done.
This is in place too.
It did this as well.
We want more than that, however.
I would quote Gaza as an example.
But we need that reform process.
We have to get this right.
We have to remedy that.
There is now a new Commission.
They look good in themselves.
This also applies to whistle-blowers.
Clear progress must be visible.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
Urgent change is required today.
They must be implemented without delay.
Have the lessons not been learnt?
It is an excellent report.
That is important.
I will give you one example of this.
It is clear that is not acceptable.
Our own staff policy is outdated.
Is this possible?
It is his first report here in plenary.
Let us be honest.
We are now four months down the line.
This must be regulated during the IGC.
Naturally, this is only to be welcomed.
A single key is to suffice in future.
There is no backbone, and no teeth.
Where is the beef?
Romano Prodi promised a revolution.
This report is about the Commission.
Parliament is a separate subject.
We should get it into perspective.
It is important to remember that.
They have very little of it.
But we need radical reform.
It is just a question of how.
We should be careful about this.
The staffing system is too rigid.
Perhaps this is a little worrying.
These are what are missing.
A very important proposal indeed.
Finally, the issue of officials.
'Long-winded' .
It is also 'confusing' .
Securing this is a major priority.
Hence the transmission.
Change in the law is fundamental.
That is most certainly relevant.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)
Such is life.
I want to underline that point.
I hope the House will understand that.
I want to emphasise four points.
The second point relates to Syria.
The moment of truth is approaching.
Unfortunately, very little.
That would be a similar situation.
We really hope and believe so.
(Applause)
(Sustained applause)
The first is asylum.
I hope that it works out.
Answers are still awaited.
Racism in Ireland is endemic.
Any democrat can spot two key problems.
Now, it is the soul.
In 1998, we had 55 murders.
Let us stop the shadow-boxing.
However, the main concern remains ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
I refer to Eurodac.
But I want to add a word of caution.

(Sustained applause)
Thank you, Minister.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0780/99):
Thank you for your answer.
The matter is still open.
Question No 5 by (H-0785/99):
Question No 6 by (H-0788/99):
Question No 8 by (H-0796/99):
Question No 9 by (H-0798/99):

Thank you, Mrs Fraga Est√©vez.
(The Minutes were approved)
Resumption of the session
Agenda
The next item is the order of business.
(Applause)
If you ratify ...
Do forgive me.
(Parliament gave its assent)
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
(Applause)
(Applause from the PSE Group)
That is deeply disturbing.
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
And these are the consequences!
(The President cut the speaker off)
(Applause)
(Applause, heckling)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
We are talking about us, not Austria.
However, that is not the problem.
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
Let us learn the lessons of the past.
Our response must be rapid.
And this is not pure chance.
(Applause)
He is a dangerous man.
In fact, we were shaken by it.
We are extremely disappointed.
Who would want this to happen?
Europe is a community of law.
(Applause)
That is our duty.
It is also a matter of conviction.
My final point is this.
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Recourse to the precautionary principle
It is therefore political by nature.
.
How would you describe this?
What establishes a recognised minority?
The Commission?
The Council?
These are my three questions.
.
Yes, Mr President, that is true.
This is part of risk management.
.
This issue is extremely topical.
.
(SV) Thank you, Mrs Sch√∂rling.
.
I have good reason for asking this.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Intergovernmental Conference
In theory, we could have done so.
That it is what we are doing.
We will talk about this on another day.
They need a political deal.
Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree.
There is time.
It lasted only five months.
That is all to the good.
That is why we need transparency.
There is clearly a more ambitious goal.
Brussels knows best.
It is, of course, thoroughly Orwellian.
(The President cut the speaker off)
There is more to be said on that score.
This is the crux of the matter.
This is a big task but it can be done.
I am, however, optimistic.
It will become totally invisible!
It has been said many times.
That puts enlargement in danger.
Must there be an IGC?
We must clearly set firm objectives.
Have we achieved results?
Tomorrow, I shall be in London.
Cross-border services
.
Neither outcome would be satisfactory.
They have now got to grips with "EU" .
Legal security requires this.

The other amendments are unacceptable.
The debate is closed.
Court of First Instance
The first concerns this Parliament.
The unease is justified.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo
We have been asked for EUR 35 million.
This is not our opinion.
The other parties are not paying.
That is excellent news!
I believe that is a good thing
What is to be done with this money?
Amendment No 4 is of a similar nature.
I agree, absolutely. We shall do so.
The debate is closed.
ALTENER
One example is the use of peat.
One last word regarding the programme.
SAVE
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
CULTURE 2000
Congratulations!
It is shameful!
Why do I say that culture is important?
That is what Culture 2000 is about.
Are we doing enough?
Cultural activity creates identity.
We want a colourful Europe.
There is a blatant discrepancy here!
That is what Culture 2000 represents.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m.)
End-of-life vehicles
This is my main concern in this matter.
We think they should.
May I say something about costs.
There are a number of sound amendments.
I ask for your support.
Neither is correct.
This is also an important point.
Is this too much of a burden?
I think we need to retain it.
The common position stipulates 2006.
The polluter should pay.
This is totally unacceptable.
Do not continue in this vein!
I would like to comment on two things.
These costs are not very high.
Now who should pay the costs?
It has become eminently political.
We cannot accept this.
We have arrived at the final question.
That is quite simply: Who pays?
That is not unreasonable.
They have paid already.
I cannot accept that.
It is far too prescriptive.
This is a big problem in my opinion.
I do not think so.
(Applause from the PSE Group)
It worked for us.
Why would it not work elsewhere?

First of all: who should pay?
No, of course not.
It is quite the opposite.
We can deal with it.
We already have an infrastructure.
These amendments can all be approved.
They cannot therefore be approved.
This is not covered by the directive.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote
It should not be in the amendment.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament approved the joint text)

Joint resolution on Austria
Is this hysteria spontaneous?
Underground networks?
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is not the way to fight extremism.
This needs to be said!
They are wrong.
Leopards do not change their spots.
.


Fascism and neo-Nazism are cancers!
The foul monster has been reawakened!
Such a concern is misplaced.
It has no right to do so.
That concludes the vote.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Are there any comments?
Madam President, on a point of order.
Thank you, Mr Davies.
Madam President, on a point of order.

Relating to Friday: President.
We already have a directive.
(Parliament gave its assent)
That is absolutely absurd.
These are serious allegations.
We are taking legal advice.
Quite, we agree absolutely.

Nothing has happened!
Five months are provided for this.
That seems to me to be rather too long.
How will these people be selected?
This is not very good at all.
The investment needs to be visionary.
That time is now past.
I hope for their adoption.
On the contrary.
One can only hope that it succeeds.
Of course this is also the basic idea.
Its argument was one of priority.
Finally, a word on INTERREG.
There is an immense risk of exclusion.
.
I can understand your concern.
I agree completely.
So much for the first comment.
I can only fully share your concern.
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega.
Absolutely, Mr Napolitano. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Lannoye.
I did not hide behind any immunity.
I took the punishment that came to me.
Mrs Lucas should do the same.
(Parliament approved the request)
They have our full support.
(Applause)
Agenda
(Parliament gave its assent)
(Applause)
We support that.
(Applause)
We need to open that debate.
That is the way it should be.
Take a look at Jean Monet' s memoirs.
That does not apply to Austria alone.
We must move faster.
So who is this then?
But seriously.
First, streamlining.
(Applause)
That is transparency.
(Applause)
(Applause)
This is not impossible.
(Limited applause)
This event must underpin enlargement.
I welcome you and your ambition.
We have 1.27% of the Community' s GDP.
Not a euro more or a euro less.
And do you know why?
Let me give you three examples.
There must also be savings.
It is not easy to combine those aims.
There is no obvious way.
This is the Commission' s own survey.
A paper this short is a farce.
We want instruments to prevent abuse.
The Commission gives no soul to Europe.
Just a few main points.
No, it does not!
No, you have not done so.
You have not integrated it anywhere.
.
They want to see results.
Certainly not!
You may draw your own conclusions.
I hope that this is a misunderstanding.
Thank you, Mr De Rossa.
Welcome
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.
We shall now proceed to the vote.1

McCarthy report (A5-0026/2000)

Why am I stressing this point?
The maritime world has great potential.

Procacci report (A5-0025/2000)
Additives in feedingstuffs
People are especially wary of GMOs.
However, more work is needed on this.
We must strike a balance between them.
GMOs are the new challenge facing us.
.
So this issue will be addressed.
I look forward to the next round.
.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Scrapie
We insist on this.
And it is still on the agenda today.
The cast is always the same.
When will you make it compulsory?
We have a new Commission.
They belong in the legislative text.
The disease is always fatal.
It is indeed.
BSE has certainly not gone away.
You can see it in different countries.
It will be there for some time to come.
.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Community policy in the field of water
Yet we do not have much time.
One example is water transfers.
There are many opportunities to hide.
It is a retrograde step.
We have seen vote after vote lost.
We are not, fortunately, at this point.
Coordination is the key word here.
It is time for action.
The time for action is upon us.
First OSPAR.
Let us grab our chance.
I understand this.
We cannot afford to wait.
You have to admit: this is a joke.
We need to change tack completely.
This can only benefit our credibility.
So this is what we are going to do.
Colleagues, you know the rules.
Thank you, Mr Napolitano.
Will you confirm what is the case?
I have two questions.
These are the modern means to be used.
I have evidence that this is possible.
I can perform this dual task.
I do not think so.
This will therefore be our rule.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
Question Time (Commission)
First part
Question No 36 by (H-0025/00):
Are you aware of this?
Are you prepared to act upon it?
This is my first additional question.
Question No 37 by (H-0029/00):
Question No 38 by (H-0040/00):
I have a related point.
Question No 39 by (H-0036/00):

Question No 40 by (H-0095/00):
Firstly he talked about verification.
We are not talking about words here.
Second part
Questions to Mrs Wallstr√∂m
Question No 41 by (H-0021/00):
Thank you for the follow-up question.
Question No 42 by (H-0026/00):
Thank you for your reply.
This is a crucial goal.
Question No 43 by (H-0045/00):
If not, why not?
Is this right and proper?
What is your opinion on that?
.
(SV) This is a very important question.
Questions to Mr Barnier
-
Question No 44 by (H-0020/00):
This is all I can say.
Will the Commission remain silent?
Will it discuss the matter?
What can the Commission do about that?
-
Question No 45 by (H-0041/00):
-
Question No 46 by (H-0052/00):
Please excuse this very legal answer.
Is that really authorised?


You may answer the question.
I have given you my answer.

This is all I can say today.
Question No 51 by (H-0049/00):
Question No 54 by (H-0117/00):
My position on this is clear.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Action must get under way immediately.
We cannot afford to waste time.
Water and air surround us everywhere.
Water is a prerequisite for human life.
We have three outstanding problems.
This applies to every country.
We cannot be accused of bad management.
Commissioner, Andalusia is not Lapland.
.
I just want to emphasise this further.
This is also expressed in Recital 14.
.
I accept that.
Thank you, Mrs Wallstr√∂m.
The debate is closed.
There is no other such policy.

Secondly, the financial contributions.
Is this not a contradiction?
Commissioner, we must be consistent.
The environment is in a parlous state.
Even EUR 850 million is not enough.
Thank you, Mrs Wallstr√∂m.
The debate is closed.
Modernising social protection
The labour market is also changing.
We must meet these challenges together.
This is good, but it is not enough.
Equality has no pillar of its own.
I think this proposal is a good one.
The challenges are different.
I endorse this view.
This is not an option for us any more.
It is an imperative.
And therein lies the paradox.

Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
WIPO treaty
Forgeries are big business.
For example, it has not been defined.
This too has not been solved.
That would not be a good thing.
Parliament cannot change these details.
I think they should have.
The problem has been overcome.
.
This is important.

Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
The smell is absolutely disgusting!
Can you please do something about it?
.
This is part of the solution.
This is where we want to go.
Mr President, I thank Mr Nielson.
We want to talk about coherence.
This is the topic.
But what have we seen since then?
It is too crazy for words, really.
Another example is cacao.
What are we actually doing then?
The inconsistency is astonishing.
Reality is obstinate.
Is the Council discussing this issue?
This is not new.
We have to be aware of this.
Take the trade agreements.
Action simply has not been taken.
What could be the cause of this?
The UN has a peace plan.
This has been talked about for years.
The same goes for Cuba, Mr Modrow.
We are discussing coherence here.
Why should we add to them?
.
.
This discussion is not new.
We should not be too masochistic.
There is a limit to how useful that is.
The debate is closed.
.
Secondly, Cuba.
So what should we do?
I wish we were closer to that.
Where does all that leave us this year?

EQUAL stands for "equality" .
It must be seen to deliver.
There must be flexibility.
The figure is now 5.35%.

What do they see?
They see us killing each other.
We all know the picture.
I say: shame on them!
It seems contradictory.
Women are systematically raped.
Take Sudan.
We must not waiver in that commitment.
We must live with our consciences."
I wish to discuss two matters.
First of all, civil society.
It is happening with Buddhism in Tibet.
The first country is Indonesia.
The situation is badly managed.
Justice needs to be done in Indonesia.
Justice needs to be done in East Timor.
.
.
It has been a useful debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Cyprus and Malta
The next item is the joint debate on:
This is the crux of the matter.
This is an extremely risky strategy.
Conditions are ripe.
.
These will take place at a later date.
Indeed that was the idea behind it.
.
Forgive me Mr Poos.

Question No 4 by (H-0028/00):
Question No 5 by (H-0031/00):
Question No 6 by (H-0122/00):

That, however, is not my question.
I did not defend attacks on civilians.

ACP-EU Joint Assembly
This I think is the new Convention.
The after-shocks can still be felt.
ACP cooperation is a dynamic process.
We must put a stop to this trend.
We must begin by writing off debts.
We must follow up words with action.
The challenge was immense.
Consistency and action are needed.
.
I do not agree.
So the "Grappa War" is over.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I might never have studied otherwise.
This applies to them and us.
Is there any prospect of membership?
This is very much on their minds.
Will it do the same to us?
That is why it is so important.
It is absolutely absurd.
Macedonia did not go through a war.
This requires internal stability.
But what then instead?
This is an urgent duty for the EU.
I am talking about Milosevic.
.
It is very helpful.
That has never been the intention.
The debate is closed.
Agreement on comitology
.
A key problem is the time factor.
I just have one more request.
It is never easy working on comitology.
So how far have we come?
Firstly, for the single market.
It is good that the procedure exists.
.
This regulation is purely instrumental.
The debate is closed.
.
It is a definite and concrete issue.
It is about our common currency.
Thank you for listening.
It is easy to counterfeit the euro.
It is a highly complex problem.
Counterfeiting is not on the list.
But that cannot be helped.
I certainly appreciate that.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
Resumption of the sitting
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
UCITS
.
They are very important in this case.
There are different views on this.
The current situation is not good.
.
I thank him for that.
We have achieved a compromise solution.
There is no freedom without rules.
Is this speculative?
Not at all.
We must put an end to this.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I salute Mr Schmidt.
Thank you very much Mr Kuckelkorn.
Firstly, I welcome proposal No 1.
.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Mr Schulz should be aware of this.
We would warn against that trend.
This leaves it wide open to abuse.
That is not guaranteed.
This issue is extremely serious.
(The President cut the speaker off)
It is not just a question of style.
It is nothing less than legal torture.
We need hard and fast rules.
.
Most say it is about time.
However, we must be realistic.
VOTE
Goebbels (PSE).
My apologies once again for my mistake.
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment)
Relating to Amendments Nos 22 and 24
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment)
Before the vote
Relating to Amendment No 31
I just wanted to correct this.

(Parliament adopted the resolution)
We are a group of unity in diversity.
Very well, I shall do so.

Company restructuring in Europe
.
We thank you for that.
Action is not limited to legislation.
Thank you very much Commissioner.
Thank you for your statement.
But thank you for your remarks.
The company went under despite this.
The market is a law unto itself.
Why should this be the case?
Michelin caused a great stir.
That concludes the debate.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
We must therefore act.
We are all immigrants.
Yet a worrying situation is apparent.
The EU can and must speak out.
Women and children were beaten.
That is my conclusion today.
.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6 p.m.
Human rights
Press freedom in Angola
Native Americans in the US - Dineh
Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky
Thank you, Mr Staes.
Why not?
Press freedom in Angola
It would be the first in a long time.
So I welcome it as such.
Yet this is not the situation.
These cases keep occurring.
This war must be stopped.
The people of Angola deserve better.
But what do these sanctions mean?
Mr President, the facts are well-known.
In my opinion, Angola is a test case.
Native Americans in the US - Dineh
So we need to do this.
It is important to point this out.
This is not the case here.
And just what is Mr CFSP doing?
What are we doing about it?
I beg you to intervene.
The facts are clear.
Nor is it a mere luxury.
Cambodia
The pattern of intimidation is clear.
All this is happening on a daily basis.
.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m.
Danube environmental disaster
The polluter ought to pay.
I would be in favour of its doing so.
The delta of the Danube is in danger.
Who is going to pay?
.
We stand ready to do so.
That is obviously crucial.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
VOTE
.
.
Tourism and employment
, rapporteur.
Students are an obvious example.
Even in the tourism industry.
It is a very extensive report.
He has convinced me of that.
Let us look at some of these reasons.
We are losing market share.
I hope you will help us.
But we must support our tourism!
It regards tourism for senior citizens.
Why is it so important in that sector?
That is where the potential is.
Are there any comments?
Strasbourg, 17 February" .
Surely we should be more selective.
(The Minutes were approved)
VOTE
.
European postal services
Perhaps we can discuss this later on.
That is usually the case.
I am very fond of him.
That has only happened recently.
We really have not progressed very far.
We will cut them off.
The postal services are important.
Apparently, they were.
Should we complain about this delay?
We do not think so.
But who defines these tasks?
What has become of it?
So be it.
I come from a rural area.
But what will those limits be?
It is time we stopped this trend.
A fault confessed is half redressed.
I think ours is a different approach!
The post office is democracy.
That is the measure of the problem.
.
Most companies hate competition.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
I wholeheartedly agree.
.
I am a European and even a federalist.
President.
Parliament has completed the agenda.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
'We are in Europe.
You can be what you want to be.
May he rest in peace.
(Loud applause)
(Loud applause)
Let us make ourselves heard!
May I ask: Quousque tandem - Noiz arte?
(Loud applause)
(Loud and sustained applause)
Are there any comments?
But we shall have a decision very soon.
(The Minutes were adopted)
Reforming the Commission
The second point is human resources.
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.
We shall now move on to Question Time.
There is effective legal precaution.
I do not use those as an excuse.
Two questions if I may.
Let the managers manage.
Thank you for the presentation.
Excessive paperwork.
That is a clear complaint that we get.
That needs to be addressed.
I know I can rely on everyone here.
That concludes Question Time.
I will set this out in five points.
How can we do this?
Thank you, Mr Poettering.
I want to concentrate on Kosovo.
Everything else is wishful thinking.
But what about Kosovo in the year 2000?
We need policemen in Kosovo right now!
So that is the world as it is today.
Let us just consider for a moment.
What is the basis of armed action?
It is still the old imperial service.
Do you think I am going over the top?
'Restore hope' , do you remember?
We all very much share this opinion.
It concerns the next IGC.
He is not stupid. Certainly not!
He is a driven man, a competent man.
This too is unacceptable in my view.
Some of them are our ACP partners.
We are now unable to guide the peace.
But is there not more to it than that?
Will it be omitted?
I wonder how this will develop.
That would seem odd to me.
This has not just happened.
NATO is largely European.
What about the infrastructures?
Has it been discussed?
So again, rhetoric and reality.
All those things come together.
Where is the beef?
Women in the decision-making process

And a woman was elected.
(Applause)
I am optimistic that we shall succeed.
The bet before us is a bet with time.
(Applause)
That is absolutely crucial.
Women are no homogenous collective.
Women deserve more than a quota.
It is quite logical, it is consistent!
That is unacceptable in a democracy.
And how should we achieve this?
The debate is a deeply political one.
Not necessary!
They have all been persuaded!
On paper!
Quotas alone are not enough.
On this we are clear.
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
Floods in Mozambique
Helicopters are therefore needed.
The water levels continue to rise.
Thank you, Mrs Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
Union Economy (1999)
This is the challenge.
This debate, I think, has summed it up.
It is as simple as that.
.
Employment is growing at a good rate.
We need public and private investment.
Common fisheries policy
The debate is closed.
Combating certain fish diseases
What about women?
The virus harms cold-blooded animals.
So further thought is necessary.
I can partly accept Amendment No 11.
The debate is closed.
Protection of juvenile marine organisms
All laudable stuff.
The debate is closed.
The debate is closed.
This is an unwise policy.
One can quote from the communication.
Such pressures are greatest in Europe.
I recommend the report to the House.
So we must practise selective fishing.
Aquaculture should also be monitored.
And just as well, in my view.
The debate is closed.
Bankruptcy procedures
.
The debate is closed.
Shipwreck of the Erika
How can those affected be compensated?
Our resolution calls for this.
Effective compensation is essential.
I would like to advocate this.
This is the right way to go.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
EC-Israel trade agreement
The choice ought to be simple.
Thank you very much, Mrs Banotti.
The debate is closed.
VOTE
Thank you very much.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Paragraph 3:

That concludes the vote.

Hudghton report (A5-0036/2000)
We look forward to that.
Katiforis report (A5-0041/2000)
We need a completely different system.
I must condemn this!
.
This is just scandalous.
Everyone must play their own part.
Katiforis report (A5-0017/2000)
That concludes the vote.
Adjournment of the session
The session is adjourned.
Resumption of the session
Thank you, Mrs Gr√∂ner.
They now have two television channels.
I hope you enjoy it.
Thank you, Mr Jonckheer.
Thank you, Mr Blak.
Thank you, Mr Sepp√§nen.
And it is not going to go away.
The tools are surely known to all.
It is a trap.
But they are used in a passive way.
Why?
We know all of this.
That is my first question.
This is a very serious risk.
The result is sobering.
Is the Council acting upon this?
But is this reflected in the policy?
We have experienced this.
This should not happen.
It is their defensive nature.
Why?
I wonder what has happened to it!
Why?
Who could challenge such an ambition?
That must be right.
We must pay attention to the old.
We are a long way from it today.
Congratulations!
That simply leaves the fulcrum.
The fulcrum is provided by resources.
It is thus up to you to create them.
This is not your objective.
But we cannot stop there.
I hope that it does just that!
, Commission.
However, we must be careful.
The problem is simple.
The debate is closed.
There are three reasons for this.
That does not apply to the plenary.
rapporteur.
Might I just ask for one more thing?
It is now our task to counteract this.
But why not?
Comitology:
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(Mr Bouwman interrupted the President.)
Bouwman.
There is another report first.
President.
Forget what I have said so far.
We will start again.
Thank you for that.
For this reason, I will be brief.
Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
Ship-generated waste and cargo residues
Not only that.
There is no financial incentive.
Let me illustrate this quite clearly.
If the percentage is 90%, so be it.
They must therefore be provided.
We agree on these points.
There are two precedents.
Why would the North Sea be so dirty?
That is the decisive issue.
It is a sound directive.
Inspection is on its way, at long last.
This is very important.
This is good for the environment.
How do we charge the fees?
The opinions are divided.
Habits, apparently, are also divided.
0.01 is clearly not a substantial part.
And this is where the problem lies.
Many thanks, Mr President.
Thank you, Madam Vice-President.
The debate is closed.
Mr President, everything has been said.
Road safety is a serious matter.
The debate is closed.
Closing of the session
I declare the 1999-2000 session closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.41 p.m.)
Opening of the session
Agenda
Let me give one example of this.
But why are we not helping out?
The second concern relates to budgets.
But what is the situation now?
I hope that Mr Prodi is listening.
Two: the internal market.
Three: the preparatory documents.
The answer is a lot.
What is the intention there?
How can this be?
I will start with trade.
It is essential.
Follow-up again, please.
We welcome that!
Go for it!
Go for it, Mr Prodi.
Your task must be an historic task.
You are not the first to try it.
We hope that you succeed.
We welcome the Luxembourg procedure.
I think not.
But is it just about updating?
No.
There are other areas.
These are the gaps we need to plug.
Why not?
There has to be a break.
I am fully aware of this.
No, not this time either!
Thank you very much, Mrs Thors.
The debate is closed.
Cocoa and chocolate products
Should we assent to other legislation?
We wanted an impact study.
We are getting codecision.
I want to pay tribute to Mr Lannoye.
Quality argues for itself.
This agony will come to an end today.
Today' s vote is a symbolic one.
What then?
This is the crux of the problem.
But is this actually true?
The margin of error is 2%.
At 5%, this is even 50% more.
This seems to be unacceptable to me.
Which is it and which will it be?
I think that is completely unnecessary.
This is not what we are asking for.
Nobody.
So what is to be done?
This is what the consumer wants.
Thank you very much, Mrs Grosset√™te.
Welcome
It is an ethical matter.
So I know what I bought.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote
There are basically two reasons.
Amendment No 6:
.
EU Charter of Fundamental Rights
I strongly commend the resolution.
.
So what is this Charter for?
The charter must contribute to this.
We want more than this.
I therefore welcome it.
There is however one risk.
Are we to secure our own rights?
For this reason, we are against it.
This is not a plus, but a minus.
This was an important goal in the past.
Let us support them in this.
This is a fundamental question.
How far is the Union prepared to go?
That concludes the debate.
This was one of them.
We confirm this approach.
This is the first principle.
That is the second principle.
We must avoid penalising them.
We eliminated any ideological thinking.
That makes absolute sense.
How will that be defined?
That is a matter of intense debate.
Could you comment on this?
Question Time (Commission)
First Part
Yes or no, Commissioner?
Question No 40 by (H-0241/00):
Question No 113 by (H-0251/00):
Might I ask you to clarify one point?
We will refer to that on our website.
Question No 41 by (H-0212/00):
I am satisfied with it for two reasons.
Question No 42 by (H-0215/00):
Question No 44 by (H-0206/00):
Question No 45 by (H-0208/00):
Thank you very much for that reply.
I would urge you to do so.
This is a good question.
That is the first reason.
It is not quite over yet.
Thank you very much, Mr Lamy.
Questions to Mr Fischler
Question No 48 by (H-0173/00):
The Commissioner has not been explicit.
Question No 50 by (H-0190/00):
You mentioned the Council.
That is no way to solve the problem.
We must draw a distinction.
Question No 51 by (H-0195/00):
Question No 52 by (H-0202/00):
Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.
Questions to Mrs de Palacio
Question No 61 by (H-0156/00):
Question No 62 by (H-0163/00):
Most countries apply a level of 0.5 mg.
Question No 63 by (H-0164/00):
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Eco-label
Our approach should be different.

They are only to be found in English.
That was the first point.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That concludes the debate.
Incineration of waste
I then asked for this to be corrected.
This subject is incredibly involved.
We must look at the whole hierarchy.
We should treat this seriously.
Above all we want to save fossil fuels.
We cannot say that it is all wrong.
This should not be happening.
And this is important and necessary.
(The President cut the speaker off)
43 amendments have been tabled.
We consequently accept this principle.
That concludes the debate.
Ozone in ambient air
We hope that you will consent to it.
Ozone smog is still on the increase.
For my group, the car is no sacred cow.
That concludes the debate.
Atmospheric pollutants

With what targets are we to start?
I think that this is a good strategy.
All of this seems quite reasonable.
Would this not be wise?
However, it is nowhere near enough.
Let me now turn to the amendments.
We must maintain technical consistency.
The debate is closed.
Environmental legislation
But what does it matter?!
And how could it be?
It must be observed!
You must do it!
I wish her well.
That is the balance I suppose.
They are seriously late.
But let us be clear.
It should not just be an idle threat.
You must stick to that.
That was not at all clear.
Let me say two or three things.
You should do that!
Here too we must watch out!
That is what this is about.
We are reasonable.
That is a clear timetable.
This will be a very important tool.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.09 a.m.)
Maes (Verts/ALE).
Never again.
This appeared not to be the case.
Iraq is a formidable enemy.
This, I deeply regret.
This was considered helping the UCK!
Surely this is too absurd for words!
There are reports of torture.
There is a vicious circle.
Human rights are indivisible.
Thank you very much, Mr Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
The next item is the joint debate on:
Certain basic rights are universal.
Obviously we need to deal with this.
The answer is yes.
Racism is a complex issue.
The Commission needs this aid.
(Applause from the right)
We have several basic principles.
Animals have rights, children do not.
We have to take tougher action.
Why can we not do the same?
Why can we not do the same?
I know we have communications.
I can give you two examples of this.
This year is especially significant.
Which is the decision-making authority?
Who knows where it will all end.
Self-criticism is not enough.
In this sense, thank you.
I condemn such a conservative ideology.
Technical work, no thank you.
Simplified rabble-rousing, yes please.
(Applause)
What do these concepts cover?
What are their philosophical origins?
What doctrines do they involve?
This is completely absurd.
Who is racist in Europe nowadays?
To ask the question is to answer it.
He deserves it.
I will give just one example.
This is a very important topic.
That is what this report aims to do.
They object to family unity.
That is the aim of Amendment No 13.
It deletes that from the report.
Is that what we want?
I do not think it is.
It would be a retrograde step.
I agree with Mr Schulz.
As a liberal I am opposed to quotas.
It refers to where we are now.
Europe is full of Haiders.
This is already happening.
Vote
After the vote:
Before the vote on Amendment No 18
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I will therefore put this to the House.
We should keep to what was decided.
Absolutely, Mrs Banotti.
We will make a note of this.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
(The President cut the speaker off)
Nothing has changed.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I am therefore not happy about this.
We must demand the following:

This is all cock-eyed.
Stop playing with our food.
Now that would be real progress.
Who would have believed it?
Everyone has different tastes.
.
They should no longer be deceived.
We can hardly do otherwise.

The answer is clearly no.
So why change it?
Not at all.
In fact, quite the contrary.
This is deceitful.
What will be next after chocolate?
.
See, in this respect, Annex V(a).
Davies report (A5-0062/2000)
This is to be regretted.
Myller report (A5-0063/2000)
I feel this is a good compromise.


This initiative is to be congratulated.
And rightly so.
It was cowardly also.
I believe it has a place here.
The report raises many relevant points.
This is praiseworthy in itself.
But we must help them with training.
That simply is not true.
We could not work without NGOs.
We will persevere with such measures.
It was not by chance at all!
That is quite clear.
The debate is closed.
Eurodac
The next item is the joint debate on:
This is not a trivial question.
And we have given our reasons.
It started back in Dublin in 1990.
That too was a very positive aspect.
It is incomprehensible.
And believe me, we shall do so.
We do not want to lose time.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Trade in bovine animals and pigs



This is a codecision process.
It pre-dates that agreement.
We noticed that.
The legal text is therefore confirmed.
That gives clarity to the situation.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0141/00):
.
Question No 2 by (H-0148/00):
This is not a European Union issue.
Question No 3 by (H-0151/00):
Question No 4 by (H-0155/00):
Your comments make perfect sense.
Question No 5 by (H-0158/00):
Thank you, Minister.
Question No 6 by (H-0160/00):
How exactly do things stand?
This comes to some USD 40 billion.
Why?
Question No 7 by (H-0162/00):
We are also concerned about this.
Question No 8 by (H-0166/00):
Question No 9 by (H-0169/00):
Would you accept that principle?
.
(The sitting was closed at 7.00 p.m.)
Thank you, Mr Evans.
EU-Mexico Interim Agreement
We cannot renegotiate the agreement.
The advantage to Mexico is obvious.
Mexico has none!
On the contrary!

Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Information society for All
How can these two things be reconciled?
These are two different things.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I do not want to deny this.
The amount is much too small.
How do we measure it?
We need to evaluate them properly.
Improvements are therefore needed here.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This, I think, should be stopped.
First there is the pragmatic deficit.
How can we become more competitive?
How can we create new markets?
Europe has talents.
Europe has skills.
Mrs Hieronymi pointed that out.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Vote
(Parliament agreed to the request)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, one other brief point.
I have some sympathy with that remark.
I am not going to debate it.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
However, I wanted to point this out.
Concerning paragraph 45:
This a serious translation error.
That would overcome all the difficulty.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
This is not a legislative report.
I suppose I cannot win.
It is going to be an interesting vote.
The members have already left!
Even the rapporteur does not want that.
That is quite in order.
We have already overrun by 45 minutes.
I suggest that we vote this evening.
The vote will be totally distorted.
This is shameful.
Two specific points.
Please let us proceed thus.
That is my motion.
It is well within the Rules.
It is normal procedure.
That is why I cannot take it now.
That concludes the votes.

Ferrer report (A5-0066/2000)
In other words it is a mini-MAI.
Duff/Voggenhuber report (A5-0064/2000)
Who was consulted beforehand?
Yes, I did say "the Commission" .
That is quite ludicrous!
Our demands are quite clear.


Jackson resolution (B5-0227/2000)
Malmstr√∂m report (A5-0060/2000)
Obviously I agree with that.
Haarder report (A5-0050/2000)
Hence our support in principle.
We must grasp these new opportunities.
I would, however, add a few caveats.
In most cases they are.
And why not?
.
Topical and urgent debate
Western Sahara
on the Western Sahara.
I am not shocked.
A referendum was held.
A state of emergency followed.
The debate is closed.
Mozambique
on the floods in Mozambique.
This is not easily done.
The debate is closed.
Human rights
Presidential elections in Peru
on the electoral process in Peru.
War crimes in Chechnya
Freedom of the press in Serbia
Situation in Iraq
on the situation in Iraq.
Situation in Jammu and Kashmir
on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.
Presidential elections in Peru:
But the guarantees are not complete.
We responded.
Freedom of the press in Serbia:
I find this a dangerous game.
I am in favour of this.
The EU makes a difference.
But we have already said that.
Situation in Iraq:
It cannot continue.
What we must not do is keep quiet.
That woman was sobbing her heart out.
We must find a solution.

The debate is closed.
Combatting organised crime
The debate is closed.
CITES
Besides which, it does not work.
This is scandalous.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Mr Buttiglione.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote (continuation)
Let us proceed with the vote.
Before the vote on Amendment 53
Thank you.
We have noted your remarks.
We are not therefore voting on it.
I would ask for this to be considered.
Mr Swoboda, that applies to both of us!
I am convinced of it.
Our reasons were as follows.
I consider that unacceptable.
(Applause)
It is badly drafted.
We abstained on point 10.
.
in writing.
It is damaging through its stridency.
That cannot be a desirable outcome.
Stand up and be counted!
But that was not to be.
This is not serious.
Report (A5-0055/2000) by Mr Belder
ECB foreign reserve assets
Why?
Yet it is a revealing slip of the pen.
Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.35 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
This was an unfair comment.
That will not be a problem.
Can I go ahead?
I conclude this from the minutes.
(The Minutes were approved)
Vote
CAP: information measures
Mr President, I welcome this measure.
Amendment No 10 concerns Article 5.
The funds available are modest.
Amendment No 11 concerns evaluation.
Amendment No 4 concerns administration.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Grain legumes
However, this has still not been done.
So how could the system be improved?
This is a reference to Amendment No 2.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Additionality
This is a clear contradiction.
There are too many jobs at stake.
I turn to the question at hand.
I listened to Ms Evans.
We should not change that.
That is what we should concentrate on.
(The President cut the speaker off)
It reduced in real terms by 30%.
So where did the Structural Funds go?
That is simply unacceptable.
'Difficult' indeed, Sir.
This is clear non-compliance.
They need this scheme to go ahead.
We have no Objective 1 funding.
So, why do I speak?
It gets no support from Europe.
Why not?
I think they might win that case.
Commissioner: three questions:
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on 11 April.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 10.50 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
It may be worse yet.
The next few hours will tell.
It should read "will never distance" .
Thank you, Mrs Morgantini.
Thank you, Mr Galeote Quecedo.
Of course, Mr Berthu.
Mr Tajani, you are quite right.
Madam President, I shall be very brief.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
Welcome
(Applause)
Agenda
It is a sensitive subject.
There do not seem to be any objections.
(Parliament gave its assent)
General product safety - BSE tests
I have quite a few questions.
I have a second question for you.
What is to be done?
Aeroplane "hushkits
Or would they?
Our position, then, is as follows:
It is now a powerful body.
That is all we know for sure.
What can we negotiate?
We can negotiate two things:
There is much ado about a great deal.
That is the only reason.
I welcome that and I congratulate you.
That much is clear.
They have given it to us so often.
We should not turn things round.
I believe they should withdraw it.
It has not even entered into force.
Why should we abolish it?
They are good regulations.
Suggest that to them, Madame Palacio.
We must go further.
That concludes the joint debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow.
Mediterranean policy
The first is a general consideration.
This is a general political concern.
The second point is more specific.
And this is a weak point.
We agree to support the civil forum.
Thank you very much, Mr Obiols.

We cannot leave them to struggle alone.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The debate is closed.
Now, how can this possibly be?
I am going to talk about asylum.
Europe must cease to turn a blind eye.
Nothing else matters.
Clearly this is not an easy task.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
2001 budgetary guidelines
Allow me to make myself quite clear.
That is the view of this Parliament.
This, for us, is the crucial approach.
Mrs Haug is not to blame.
Why?
It concerns civil dialogue.
Thank you very much, Mrs Langenhagen.
This division of tasks is unacceptable.
That cannot be.
We have stretched out our hand.
Mrs Haug has stretched out her hand.
We can work together.
You should know that.
Take the outstretched hand.
This is a very serious commitment.
Now to Mrs Haug' s report.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Combating child sex tourism
It is an extremely serious problem.

Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Liability for defective products
This is a very good idea.
I do not think it should be prejudged.
Which is why we have been elected.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Electricity
But, on balance, everyone is in favour.
We must recognise that.
The distinction is easy to make.
They need permanent protection.
We certainly have no lack of reports.
How can we do this?
Secondly, aid must be degressive.
What can we do about it?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
I want to stress two points.
I have never said that.
Thank you, Mr Berthu.
Are there any further comments?
He did not say that.
Absolutely. I remember that too.
That will be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
It is standard procedure, Mr Staes.
This is not a lack of transparency.
It is not up to me to do it.
Quite, Mr Wurtz.
The "Echelon" system

These ideas are still being developed.
So what is to be done, then?
I have to say I am disappointed.
I think we have a right to know.
I am really very worried.
Where is this taking us?
Our fellow citizens have been alerted.
Will you ever go to Sydney again?
But stronger than whom?
Stronger in opposition to Iraq?
In opposition to the Serbs?
Poor old European Commission!
Poor old European Council of Ministers!
Poor old European Union!
I therefore have three questions.
I did do so and I do so again.

I think this decision is very clear.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
That is the reason why I am here today.
Why do I mention this?
Moreover, everyone must adhere to this.
I agree with him.
Well, President, it is forbidden.
We are working on that.
Not so.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Vote
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Concerning Amendments Nos 4 and 5:
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Concerning Amendment No 4:
.
Ferber report (A5-0068/2000)
Resolution on "hushkits" (B5-0289/2000)
That is stressed in the resolution.
Resolution on Mediterranean policy
Hern√°ndez Mollar report (A5-0057/2000)
Klamt report (A5-0052/2000)
That is intolerable!
Progress is, of course, being made.
MacCormick report (A5-0061/2000)
Turmes report (A5-0078/2000)
Do we pay for the air we breathe?
That is unfortunately not the case.
Where will it end?
There is plenty of money at stake.
That concludes the vote.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
(Applause from the left)
Thank you.
(Mixed reactions)
Thank you, Mr Sepp√§nen.
It is not just a little detail.
I will attend to it this week.
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.
We are now faced with a dilemma.
Almost every country plays football.
It is known as a beautiful game.
Thank you, Mr Miller.
We shall do so.
Agenda
Relating to Tuesday:
Let me turn now to Mr H√§nsch.
Is this what you propose?
So, Tuesday Turkey, Wednesday Ethiopia.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Relating to Wednesday:
Yes, of course.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Relating to Thursday:
For goodness sake, let' s vote on it!
Yes, I think that is clearer.
(Parliament gave its assent)
It is okay to have five points.
Thank you for that.
It is up to the House to decide.
I think we are all in agreement.
I do not think that would be a problem.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Child pornography on the Internet
That ought to be a basic human right.
This is the key to prevention.
95 to 97% of the Internet is legal.
It is a high-quality text.
In fact, his name fills us with hope.
The NGOs are doing a great job.
This is an irresponsible attitude.

It is the originators we must combat.
(Applause and mixed reactions)
We welcome the debate on the age limit.
Actions must follow.
Then it all sounds so wonderful.
On this point, Mr Hager is correct.
The Internet has the aura of progress.
This is a problem.
My second point is the age limit.
It cannot be set high enough.
16 is just the first step.
The target must remain 18.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
European Refugee Fund
The second objection is more extensive.
The Commission is on the right track.
I agree.
We therefore support these motions.

That contradicts the basic intention.
Financing must be ensured up to 2004.
This proposal raises many questions.
Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The Commission took a similar view.
We therefore welcome the directive.
What are we talking about here?
We will monitor this.
This must change!
That is very regrettable.
This does not make sense.
That concludes the debate.
Animal nutrition inspections
There are ample examples to prove this.
Scandals can have a cleansing effect.
Such is life!
It has learnt none of these things!
That concludes the debate.
What is being proposed today?
I shall mention them quickly.
Others should be used far less widely.
This raises a few questions.
This makes stale carrots look fresh.
But its meaning remains crystal clear.
What are we discussing here?
The question answers itself.
That is the prime consideration.
That concludes the debate.
(The sitting closed at 9.20 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
I should like that to be corrected.
It shall be done, Mrs McNally.
Thank you for your understanding.
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr President, on a point of order.
(Applause from the right)
Vote on request for urgent procedure
.
It is planned for our agenda in May.
We can leave this until next month.
1998 discharge, budgetary control
All the cases are awaiting a decision.
There has been no whitewash.
The inventory has been addressed.
Mr Sepp√§nen addressed it yesterday.
I think it is about time this stopped.
We are expecting a report on this.
There is something else.
Or does it intend to?
A few words now on Mr Casaca' s report.
We are working on that.
Mrs Schreyer also mentioned it.
This includes reappraising old cases.
We shall have to debate this.
Excuses and promises are no use.
We need clear proof of improvement.
We check their accounts.
Mrs Stauner quoted Goethe.
I will quote Shakespeare.
We do not want witch-hunts.
It is always greatly appreciated.
This was already mentioned last night.
We must not get ahead of ourselves.
This is an extremely political issue.
Europe' s ideal needs to be preserved.

And so on and so forth.
No.
No.
I come to two points here.
The first is access to information.
Why?
It is an arbitrary procedure.
I do not share this view.
We are the controlling body.
But Mrs Morgan, this is not happening.
This is no longer the exception.
The price tag is FFR 27.4 million.
This is ludicrous!
These shady tricks must stop at once.
Why such a steep rise?
They are not the only ones.
Documents must not disappear.
It is a general debate.
Of course we must.
That is not the case.
I should like to give an example.
I look forward to seeing the results.
As are we.
Then everyone will have a true picture.
Questions can hurt.
I thank Mrs Stauner for her report.
These are the three positive features.
This gives us grounds for concern.
That is right.
This merits further attention too.
OLAF must use its teeth.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Vote
Before the final vote:
Before the vote on the amendments:
I am sorry but it is too late.
The request was not submitted in time.
The Rules are very clear.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTES
Staes report (A5-0084/2000):
Lannoye report (A5-0072/2000):
There are still loopholes!
Kirkhope report (A5-0090/2000):


That concludes the vote.
It was certainly a turning point.
It will not be.
(Applause from the left)
The first point is the strategic goal.
The second point relates to employment.
This is also true of the Monti package.
I cannot however be delighted by it.
(Applause from the right)
That is our challenge.
It is action not words that is needed.
Do not worry, it is meaningless.
Such cynicism borders on candour!
Partly that follow-up is institutional.
If so, I think we will be disappointed.
Congratulations, Mr President.
This is a problem too.
We have listed a few problems.
It needs to be done locally.
We must not allow that to happen.
This is very serious.
Secondly, social security.
This begs another comment on Lisbon.
That is clear.
The debate is closed.
.
Peace can bring prosperity.
They have no toilets.
But none of this is the key issue.
And why not?
Because no destination was established.
Black Africa was supposed to turn red.
I disagree with him on this.
The figures speak for themselves.
Quite the opposite.
But who notices that here in Europe?
Such a step is significant.
They should become the norm.
I would like to add one more point.
.
I would like to clarify a few points.
Why was this the case?
Another important point is debt.
It was time to put right this delay.
It had never been done before.
It was the first time.
We took that step.
I wish that were true.
They got along quite well.
That concludes the debate.
External relations package
It is a very practical document.
It is not an ideal solution.
There is an image problem.
We will keep in touch with them.
We can manage EUR 30 or 40 million.
It is much needed.
I recognise the case for coherence.
There are differences.
Would the Commissioner agree with that?
That is unacceptable.
The stores down there are empty.
Where was ECHO?
Absolutely nothing has been done.
I just wish to add two points.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Question Time (Commission)
First part
Question No 34 by (H-0306/00):
Thank you very much, Mr Patten.
We therefore wish you a good afternoon.
Question No 32 by (H-0293/00):
Question No 33 by (H-0298/00):
.
No applications have been filed.
Question No 35 by (H-0307/00):
Now let me come to Romania.
Not that I am saying that it is untrue.
Simply that we cannot confirm it.
.
This is the Rule in this House.
Question No 37 by (H-0272/00):
This is a disgrace!
A disgrace!
Does the Commissioner agree with that?
We have examined this carefully.
Thank you for your answer.
Thank you very much, Mrs Schreyer.
Question No 40 by (H-0332/00):
I thank the Commissioner for his reply.
.
Question No 41 by (H-0342/00):
How do you plan to address this?
Questions to Mr Byrne
.
Question No 49 by (H-0284/00):
Firstly, it does not start on time.
Situation in Turkey
.
The ball is in Turkey' s court.
Mr Birdal advocates peace.
To say this is not to be anti-Turkish.
Including Turkey.
Why are arms being delivered to Turkey?
That is very important.
They certainly want membership.
Turkey has made none.
Have they still not managed to do so?
Is that such a drastic step?
Except that they do nothing.
I warned you about that.
Changes need to be made here.
But no, this is not the case.
.
No!
Nobody said that!
The debate is closed.
Many aspects worry me.
Take the example of genetic transfer.
I have a key witness here.

We regret this toning down.
We believe that God created the world.
That is only right.
It is fair.
This is not acceptable.
But nor can we demonise it.
We must address those very real issues.
What are the risks?
It must be seen in that context.
I just want a yes or no.
I should like a clear answer on this.
I am not reopening the debate.
Commissioner, do you wish to reply?
.
Your views are also welcome.
It already covers product liability.
The debate is closed.
I propose that we change this system.
It is only a matter of four months.
The two should not be confused.
We should not go down this road.
Why do we want that?
My last point is to end where I began.
The postponement adopted is not lawful.
This system has proved very effective.
This is a good move.
The amendments will be adopted.
It is high time we took action.
We simply need this.
I agree with this.
The Commission thinks it should.
This is often a matter of taste.
The internal market is a large entity.
This is unacceptable in my view.
One of those words is "slaughtered".
I wish we could find a new word for it.
I want to sound a note of caution.
I have a number of concerns.
The first is: who pays?
It has not been borne by the retailer.
I seriously question that point.
Is this a wise move?
That concludes the debate.
(The sitting was closed at 12.10 a.m.)
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mrs Ludford.
Thank you, Mrs McKenna.
It is so embarrassing.
Thank you, Mrs Laguiller.
(The Minutes were approved)
IGC
Thank you, Mr Ribeiro e Castro.
Thank you, Mr Berthu.
Some countries have a different system.
We have recital 15.
(Laughter and applause)
None of them is currently operative.
I would like to raise two points.
My second point concerns energy.
We owe this to our citizens.
Maybe we will do so in future.
That must not be just on paper.
We cannot create an Amsterdam 2.
We must adopt a more positive approach.
Join us in SOS Democracy.
We would like to make three points.
Secondly, the importance of transport.
Next is the number of MEPs.
Leftovers are thrown in the bin.
The euro is to be introduced.
We have heard this before.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Our priority is enlargement.
It is ambitious.
That is essential for our future.
VOTE
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Simplified procedure without report:
Wallstr√∂m, Commission.
(Laughter, Applause)
Thank you, Mr Liese.
It is that very common position.
He does not seem to agree with you.
I can only regret that.
There were eight votes to go.
To tell the truth, I agree with you.
(Mixed reactions)
For it is unacceptable...
(Applause)
Before the vote
I am very glad about that.
Paragraph G is inaccurate.
There are major issues at stake.
That tells us something.
I want to issue this warning today.
Further delays would be a mistake.
Papayannakis report (A5-0088/2000)
Lisbon European Council
EU-Africa Summit in Cairo
IGC (continuation)
I listened to Mr Segni' s speech.
First number: 700.
Second number: two thirds.
We must create a formal symmetry.
Third and last number: 2009.
So what is different?
The answer is everything.
What a frightening idea of democracy!
IGC 2000 is not the end of the story.
Europe is at a crossroads.
We must strike a balance.
In my opinion, we need more than that.
That is not something to be proud of.

This point is very important.

Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Famine in Ethiopia

We are monitoring this issue.
It is a lethal mix.
That is the frustration.
That is the background.
It is important to be aware of it.
It is important to remember that point.
They are jointly responsible.
It is not easy.
We should nonetheless not lose hope.
Why do we still allow this to happen?
Do we not have a conscience?
It is not true that we show solidarity.
No.
I am not saying anything new.
Yet we cannot relax.
Starvation and death continue today.
Sadly they see only a rain of bullets.
People crave water, food and medicine.
These measures are palliative.

Thank you very much Minister.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
First of all, the funding.
What is the progress here?
Fourthly, the NGOs.
Finally, the distribution of tasks.
.
So what are these issues?
So what are they?
A domino effect.
It is a bet which must be won.
Mr President, I will make three points.
It is causing serious harm.
And who can lift it if Europe does not?
Then there is the issue of crime.
It is important to be clear about that.
People say that is a crazy figure.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0255/00):
Question No 2 by (H-0286/00):
Question No 3 by (H-0299/00):

If anything, things are worse.
But no more!
But that cannot happen.
That was my comment.
In fact, quite the contrary is true.
This is very clear to me.
For goodness sake!
I cannot make this any clearer.
Question No 4 by (H-0294/00):

Question No 5 by (H-0262/00):
I want to thank him for his answer.
You refer to the KLA.
Question No 6 by (H-0279/00):
.
What is hiding behind all that?
The European Union is not a country.
Question No 7 by (H-0274/00):
Question No 9 by (H-0275/00):
The European Union must be progressive.
Question No 10 by (H-0276/00):
They were not able to before.
Question No 12 by (H-0277/00):

Question No 13 by (H-0283/00):
This is why they signed the Treaty.
Mr President, we have now heard you.
Our vigilance is not partisan.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Loud applause.
Uproar on the far right)

What is included in these measures?
We could not agree more.
I would appreciate a reply to this.
That covers the general framework.
This increases choice and diversity.
I think he deserves tribute for this.
And what is the truth?
It is an important remark.
This is a very important matter.
But how exactly can this be done?
This is beyond dispute.
I believe that this is not right.
This freedom remains.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Strategy for Europe' s Internal Market
What was that message?
I hope that is appreciated.
Back to basics should be our motto.
Responsibility lies with both camps.
And he is right, of course.
Let us hope that this will change.
We are all waiting for this moment.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
2001: European Year of Languages
Language is a powerful force.
It is a means of occupation.
What better rapporteur could there be?
Now it tends to be English.







Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Youth
We will always ask for more money.
The budget is not enough.
But we can be pleased with the outcome.
It is a very good report.
I hope that does not happen.
That is an excellent initiative.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.45 a.m.)

Two questions still remain, however.
This change is a complicated change.
This is certainly a step forward.
Overall, this is a useful step forward.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
COM in bananas
The stakes are high.
But let us give them time.
They will then become competitive.
Parliament does not like it either.
After bananas, will other sectors fall?
We support his report.
Well, it is not enough!
The United States wants more.
Technically, what does it want?
It is divided and getting bogged down.
We are divided from our German friends.
And we have tabled amendments too.
It is regional policy that is at stake.
The reason for that is simple.
Yes, we have to simplify the system.
Yes, we have to find a solution.
That is essential.
I support the Commissioner's efforts.
He has a difficult task.
That is the official position.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Vote
That is why I tabled this amendment.
Is that correct?
on Amendment No 5

After the vote on Amendment No 5
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
before the vote
Parliament has not yet voted on them.
on Amendment No 4
We cannot accept that word.
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
But I have to apply the rules.
I put the question to Parliament.
I thought that was the case.
That is the simplest approach.
Right, thank you for making that clear.
on compromise Amendment No 227
on Amendment No 174 from the PPE Group
Is that right, Mr Brok?
So it would be easier to do that here.
Is that right?
That is the old text.
We cannot split this again now.
That is clear.
I proposed a solution in both cases.
before the final vote
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
(Loud applause)
We think not.
We are against such an approach.
So we have chosen to abstain.
Kuhne Report (A5-0097/2000)
That is clear.
But we know that.
I am confident that we can do that.
We should be able to crack this one.
I say this with regret.
There is nothing of this, however.
I have therefore voted against.
This is why I voted for this amendment.
It imposes forced privatisation.
, in writing.
Therefore,
That concludes the vote.
Topical and Urgent Debate
Iraq
This is not acceptable.
We cannot allow this to go on.
It is the ordinary people who suffer.
We cannot allow this to go on.
That is absolutely unacceptable.
I too have met some of these people.
And that is essential.
This is important for all of us.
There are no books.
It is perverse.
Do not keep silent!
Do not be accomplices!
UN officials are resigning.
I appeal to your consciences!
Europe is denying itself!
He decided to resign.
The debate is closed.
Chechnya
Mary Robinson obtained limited access.
What proportion are we talking about?
This is unacceptable.
Please explain this to us.
That is what we should condemn.
The debate is closed.
Human rights
Jewish prisoners in Iran
Akin Birdal
Tibet
Zimbabwe
Jewish prisoners in Iran
God willing, that is what we shall see!
So it is imperative that we react.
The youngest is only sixteen years old.
We must make ourselves perfectly clear.
Who are the accused?
What are they supposed to have done?
No one really knows!
That was refused.
That was also refused.
Up to now that has been refused.
I agree with all the previous speakers.
The reason: espionage.
Yet again.
The Jewish communities are afraid.
What is likely to happen?
Akin Birdal
He must be released immediately.
Those were Akin Birdal' s words.
It is real provocation.
When will this end?
Tibet
How did a Tibetan delegate put it?
Tashi delek!
A great many people are involved here.
Death penalty in the United States
This is by no means an enviable record.
Zimbabwe
This could take up to three months.
This would show real transparency.
I particularly highlight land issues.
The court rulings were ignored.
Land reform is necessary.
It must, however, take place lawfully.
The elections are therefore necessary.
The rule of law is necessary.
Finally, Zimbabwe.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
World education forum
I am pleased with this resolution.
Make resources available.
Defenceless, babies have no duties.
They cannot have any.

Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Taiwan
on Taiwan.
China reacted furiously.
That is indeed the case.
Is that a threat to China?
The Taiwanese have shown that.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
This is an oral amendment.
Are there any objections?
(Loud applause)
Mr President, I think we should vote.
Let us proceed to the vote.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Vote (continuation)
Perhaps you could let me know later.
Mr President, do you feel young?
I think you are saying that you do.
.
Our young people are Europe's future.
Gra√ßa Moura report (A5-0099/2000)
Gas√≤liba i B√∂hm (ELDR).
All of them are already bilingual.
Dary report (A5-0093/2000)
Maes (Verts/ALE).
The problem, however, is the price.

Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).

The opposite is true of course.

COM in milk
So what is this all about?
Why?
Is that logical?
Surely you can see that.
Why not 'weary women' as well?
That concludes the debate.
COM in milk
I found that remarkable in itself.
This has been borne out by studies.
You must also be realistic.
That is a good thing.
There are two possibilities.
We all acknowledge the aim here.
It is to cut milk subsidies.
Let us be clear.
That is the reality of the situation.
I am not proud of that.
This is not unique to my nation.
Yet they have already diversified.
(The President cut the speaker off)
It is good value for money.
We do not always achieve that.
I want to thank Mr Maat.
I think it is complete nonsense.
It is not just beneficial to farmers.
Children do not need so much fat.
I do not think so.
We do not wish to be part of that.
Thank you for your attention.
That concludes the debate.
Vertical Restraints
I feel this is especially problematic.
These are Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4.
That concludes the debate.
(The sitting was closed at 8.20 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
I wish that to be placed on the record.
(The Minutes were approved)
It will be included in the Minutes.
Vote
I am now giving the floor to Mr Schulz.
(Applause)
We cannot go on like this.
I think that goes without saying.
Four MEPs have left the chamber.
The doors will remain open.
Nobody acted upon this.
(Applause)
That can hardly be called frivolous.
This is not the way things are done.
Information and communication

That must be taken into consideration.
This situation is getting worse.
Why is this so?
Why this lack of enthusiasm for the EU?
I fear we are doing neither.
We must make more and better use of it.
This goes hand in hand with efficiency.
That would be a disaster.
That really must be taken seriously.
It has one Internet connection.
We thank you for this.
I do not think that it was!
Thank you, Mr President.
May I first answer Mr Perry.
We have to act.
I know about this problem.
I consider it very important.
It is a private decision of the media.
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I share the concerns of Mr MacCormick.
I would like this to be recorded.
I am taking note of this.
This will be taken care of.
Let us not enter into discussion.
Deliberation is always possible.
Night flights and excessive noise
But what is meant by night?
Mr President, so what needs to happen?
What is worse?
I am looking forward to her reply.
When will this happen?
But this is not the case at all.
Let us hope that it will improve.
Does it end at 5 a.m. or at 7 a.m.?
We cannot allow this to continue.

I will not bore you with the details.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
This was the speaker against.
I am giving the floor to Mr Blokland.
We are going by the Rules.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I do not consider this acceptable.
Even then a vote is fully valid.
Mr Posselt, you are absolutely right.
This is clear enough, I think.
Let us move on to the next item.
The issue is wider than that.
Did we actually intervene?
The question has been put to you.
What action are you going to take?
The matter is urgent.
The time has come to move on.
We support these legitimate claims.
I am a farmer.
You can see that.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(The President cut the speaker off)
I am extremely concerned.
That is the real question.
It is disgraceful.
It is true that some have left.
And this is why the problem has arisen.
You then have to respond accordingly.
Matters proceeded as was established.
So thank you.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I feel truly ashamed.
That is how all this came about.
Thank you, Mr Posselt.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Thank you, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo.
I have taken note of your proposal.
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.
Thank you, Mr Miller.
Thank you, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo.
Thank you, Mr Ribeiro.
This is what Rule 7 states:
(The President cut the speaker off)
It is quite out of the question.
(Mixed reactions)
That time is up.
Review of the financial perspective
I think that this is a genuine problem.
I will conclude with my third question.
This item is closed.
Vote
Thank you for that clarification.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Pes√§l√§ report (A5-0081/2000)
Maat report (A5-0074/2000)
This is the situation in 2000.
This is an unacceptable proposal!
.
.
.
That is why we need this redeployment.
Studies alone, however, are not enough.
They have not done so.
In fact, they have achieved nothing.

They did not do so.
Let me make two final comments.
What we need is cross-financing.
Let me give an example of this.
I want to make this very clear.
Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
European airline industry
Is that in any way related to aviation?
No mergers have taken place.
What do we do then on our own?
It enhances individual mobility.
A fat lot of good that will do them.
This is a step in the right direction.
I support him in this.
Competition also leads to lower costs.
It is vital to guarantee their rights.
This too needs to be regulated.
I shall begin with the medium term.
We must go further in this regard.
I now turn to the short-term aspects.
And maybe it will.
Greece is a typical example.
This is extremely important.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
There are clear imbalances.
At least that is what I think.
We have precise data.
The rotation system is clear.
What should we make of it?
That is a mammoth task.
This discussion would be meaningless.
We must realise this.

That is a serious problem.
Thank you very much, Mrs Morgan.
Most have submitted theirs.
That to me is modest.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Legal aspects of electronic commerce
No amendments!
That is a good balance.
It is, of course, global.
Confidence is essential.
E-commerce is in its early stages.
That essentially is what we have here.
It is therefore a balanced proposal.
I would warn against complacency.
Parliament works significantly faster.
I would like a reply to this question.
I do not think so.
Yet we have a real chance to catch up.
Many thanks!
That will send out a clear signal.
So there is no reason to delay.
I think that is not good enough.
I am a little out of breath.
This is, of course, true.
The risk is there.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Food Aid 1999
.
But let me add a few general comments.
That is feasible, in any case.
The debate is closed.
This is a very urgent matter.
It is four months since it expired.
Mr President, it seems simple.
Hoarding does impoverish.
I welcome the recognition of this.
That concludes the debate.
EC-Switzerland agreements


It is a step in the right direction.
We want closer cooperation in Europe.
We want more dialogue.
That should set us thinking.
The agreements are very important.
They did that in October last year.
That concludes the debate.
Financial assistance to Moldova
This, however, is not enough.
It has become a ragamuffin state.
Moldova is still living proof of this.
However, I have two questions.
That concludes the debate.
(The sitting was closed at 10.55 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Combating counterfeiting and piracy
It can be dangerous to health.
This is not a victimless crime.
These must be kept separate.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
The first concerns Category 4.
Category 4 is already overloaded.
Another problem concerns competence.
How much did the destruction cost?
Milosevic is still in power.
Kosovo is a ravaged country.
The debate is closed.
Welcome
Vote
The European Union is no exception.
Carraro recommendation (A5-0118/2000)

Hatzidakis report (A5-0076/2000)
Sterckx report (A5-0075/2000)
That concludes the voting.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
- Thank you, Mr Oostlander.
Agenda
Relating to Thursday:
At the moment, we only have four.
Thank you, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
(Parliament approved the proposal)
Thank you, Mrs van der Laan.
Thank you, Mr Blak.
Mrs Banotti will reply immediately.
Mr Blak will explain it to you.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I just wanted to point that out.
Madam President, on a point of order.
This must be a first!
(The last vote was held after 12.00.)
I support the action in this sense.
Agricultural prices
But that is not the case!
This is purely accidental.
This happens in many instances.
Will it be extended?
What is the intention here?
Will they step up their fight?
(The President cut the speaker off)
And you have our support.
I now come to Amendments Nos 6 and 7.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Flax and hemp for fibre
People have overstepped the mark.
Thirdly, the use of certified seed.
You know what procedure this is.
It gives farmers time to adapt.
You see we are not under any illusions!
I can accept Amendment No 6 on hemp.
But the actual objective is clear.
This principle also applies here.
I think that you agree with me on this.
The debate is closed.
Civil liability and motor vehicles
That is a very big step forward.
That is a clear case of discrimination.
The debate is closed.
Both amendments seem well-considered.
We thank you very much for it.
That would be endangered.
I think this is disgraceful.
Poverty is an injustice.
We want the reconstruction of Kosovo.
This is unethical.
We also support the second amendment.
There has been a misunderstanding.
Decision on urgent procedure
We should leave it until next month.
Thank you Mr Wynn.
That is a very sensible opinion.
It might be helpful to verify this.
It cannot take it away from Bosnia.
It cannot take it away from Kosovo.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
2001 Budget - Parliament' s estimates
That is the wrong way forward.
That is the right way forward.
That is a very long wait.
We shall see, in time.
But not in this case!
We congratulate him wholeheartedly.
And it is needed.
No, preparations need to be made now.
I shall explain why shortly.
I am not saying that we have done that.
I broadly welcome Mr Ferber's report.
The decision will be taken for us.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

So far so good.
We can support that.
I would have expected it to be higher.
We are all dying to see it.
Thank you, Mrs Haug.
I will give you an example.
But that is not for next year.
That is for the future.
I request that this be put to the vote.
Thank you, Mr Dell'Alba.
(Parliament rejected the motion.)
I welcome this judgement.
The legal basis for this is in place.
This provision has never been applied.
That cannot work and it does not work.
(Applause)
First was the issue of definition.
This opens the door to fraud.
The issue should not be taken lightly.
Expectations are naturally very high.
She did not succeed.
What are we not allowed to see?
I would like to highlight two.
That is the truth of the matter.
That has now been cleared up.
I do not agree with all of his report.
That is indefensible.
I was not wearing my glasses.
Do you wish to add anything else?
No?
They always get big coverage.
It is about time they signed up.
They have had five years to do it.
Let us see them ratify it.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Vote
We would be happy to vote.

Rothley report (A5-0130/2000)
This matter is now resolved.
This is 500 000 too many.
Thank you, Mr Martin.
Thank you, Mrs Cauquil.
Jeggle report (A5-0115/2000)

Schierhuber report (A5-0124/2000)
.
.
B√∂sch report (A5-0116/2000)
That is indefensible.
It has now presented it.
This would cost a great deal of money.
I sincerely hope so.
I also want to thank Mr B√∂ge.
Everyone must be treated the same.
I am thinking of the last intervention.
Mr Happart left us and Mr Pagel died.
Why not?
Why?
This is nothing new.
I think this is not a tenable position.
So this regulation is a good one.
Of course we need that.
This is working.
Cases of BSE are declining rapidly.
However, I accept Amendment No 52.
That is the advice I have been given.
I identify cats here in particular.
Thank you again for your cooperation.
The debate is closed.
Organisation of working time
Thank you, Mr Provan.
My thanks go to all of you.
Certainly it was meant to be.
The second point concerns sea-fishing.
We have to stop that drain.
They have played an important role.
I hope that this will continue.
That is the problem.
It is now up to the Commission.
More of this later.
One does not exclude the other.
The results are acceptable.
That was unfortunate.
I shall come back to this point.
Parliament made most of the running.
This was no mean feat!
We have discussed this in the past.
I will try to clarify it.
I am afraid I was not clear enough.
That is very clear and very precise.
It is very much appreciated indeed.
The debate is closed.
Reviewing aid to third countries
That is an embarrassingly large figure.
That is for the future.
We have to do better.
We are not bidding for a bigger empire.
I am sure this will be a long debate.
This is the situation as we see it.
That goes without saying.
ECHO is going to continue.
This is a well established discussion.
I noticed your choice of word there.
This is the message.
I realise that.
But there are other elements around.
We have to say it √† tous azimuts.
This is our biggest problem.
That is not the case.
This is the goal.
Question Time (Commission)
First part
Question No 32 by (H-0433/00):
What action did the Commission take?
Question No 34 by (H-0357/00):
If so, in what way?
Question No 35 by (H-0411/00):
Thank you Mr President.
That is what I wanted him to clarify.
I am happy to respond to Mr Korakas.
Question No 37 by (H-0409/00):
What kind of large budget?
What has happened with the euro?
Question No 38 by (H-0419/00):
Questions to Mr Verheugen
The latter proposal won the day.
Thank you for your comments.
Question No 39 by (H-0352/00):
Which chapters have been completed?
But this happens on a regular basis.
That has been done.
They come at the end.
If there were, I would know about it.
But there is not.
But we have not yet reached that point.
Mrs Thors is raising a point of order.
That is the corollary of free movement.
It forms part of the Community acquis.
My own personal opinion is irrelevant.
I am not getting at you.
Please read the Rules of Procedure.
There are two questions.
I am not going to get into a debate.
Question No 43 by (H-0354/00):
You mentioned the problem of resources.
Question No 44 by (H-0355/00):
Thank you, Mr Turmes.
Question No 45 by (H-0383/00):
Could you elaborate on that please?
I shall try, Mrs Ahern.
Carbon dioxide emissions from new cars
I think that is a huge success.
The debate is closed.
What is the subject matter?





Nobody can deny its importance.
This should not be done again.
The comment about industry is correct.
That has already been said.
So let us adapt.
What is the problem?
I think that is important.
But still!
That is in nobody' s interest.
(Applause from various quarters)
I find that totally atrocious.
Amendment 28, Article 22(3).
Amendment 29, Article 24(1).
The joint debate is closed.
British Nuclear Fuels at Sellafield
He gave me a serious answer.
However, what about Euratom inspectors?
Can we trust them?
I can give them very short answers.
That is a quote from their report.
I have no time.
Both of these are forms of recycling.
Their livelihoods were endangered.
There is undoubtedly progress.
This is unacceptable.
A strategic approach is needed.
I do not.
No, it did not!
No, it did not!
No, it did not.
The workers at BNFL raised the issue.
They were the ones who discovered it.
Let us be clear.
I wish them well.
But words are not enough.
Witness the BSE and dioxin problem.
I will conclude.
We need European rules.
Are there any comments?
Mr Robin Cook is in Moscow today.
Nothing.
(The Minutes were approved)
Broad outlines of economic policies
.
This percentage is a familiar figure.
This is surely some mistake!
Now it is the euro.
Let us encourage women.
We need a strategy.
Beware!
Do we want even more?
It is not just in that area.
This is a crucial point.
Stability and convergence programmes
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Adoption of single currency by Greece
The rate of inflation exceeded 20%.
In 1985, the dollar stood at 3.5 DM.
Greece has a tax reform problem.
Mr Goebbels also points this out.
It is MU, not EMU.
We agree.
I welcome Greece into the euro zone.
Agenda
Are there any objections?
Vote
Why am I in favour of this measure?

Roth-Berendt report (A5-0117/2000)
Savary report (A5-0113/2000)
How could I do otherwise?
Savary report (A5-0112/2000)
I look forward to that day.
I have a problem with that country.
A weak euro lets them down badly.
I think it is time for some changes.
That is indisputable.
For me, the reason for this is clear.
There is a lack of leadership.
Are they sustainable?
This is the end of a process.

The debate is closed.
This caused me concern.
Can something be done about this?
An example is Internet connection.
These are very reasonable demands.
The debate is closed.
Poor countries' debt
We are all aware of the situation.
We should not be na√Øve about this.
That is naturally not enough.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I do not believe that to be the case.
Let us learn from past experience.
That part of it is highly welcome.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Situation in Zimbabwe
This is a good sign.
People in Zimbabwe are afraid.
Land reform is necessary, of course.
They demand the elections.
They must be given a chance.
It is their future.
We must avoid this at all costs.
Put away hatred.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
The rest will be replied to in writing.
We will begin Question Time.
Question No 1 by (H-0350/00):
I hope that this is in fact the case.
Mr President, on a point of order.
That I do know about.
I will take good note of your question.
Question No 2 by (H-0361/00):
Question No 3 by (H-0365/00):
Question No 5 by (H-0370/00):
Question No 8 by (H-0376/00):
That is all.
Question No 10 by (H-0381/00):
It is one of Parliament' s duties.
Question No 13 by (H-0389/00):
, Council.
It was most interesting.
What I am hearing is quite absurd.
Question No 14 by (H-0390/00):
Question No 16 by (H-0396/00):
One of these groups is the disabled.
Question No 18 by (H-0392/00):
Will that remain the case?
Question No 20 by (H-0395/00):
That is how the EU works.
Experiences from India are equally bad.
This cannot be right.
.
There was no such consensus previously.
The debate is closed.
Coherent European approach for space
.
Thank you, Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel.
How can this be?
I am booking my seat today!
The debate is closed.
European research area
It creates employment and prosperity.
I am very grateful for that.
We must increase it.
Legal devices are important.
We should improve the European patent.
They are the people at the sharp end.
We also need other things.
The omens are not entirely good.
That is also vital.
This is what our approach must be.
So the area ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Dear Commissioner, what a challenge!
These two aspects are closely linked.
The first stage is clear.
That is no surprise to anyone, I think.
The debate is closed.
Peking action platform
No statistical data exists.

This was also said a moment ago.
Another theme is decision making.
We are now familiar with this.
This much we now know.
That was the reason for the delay.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.53 p.m.)
Thank you, Mrs Napoletano.
Statements by the President
I have two statements to make.
Once again, I thank her.
Go ahead, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.
France is a constitutional state.
I respect what Mr Bar√≥n Crespo says.
The sentence exists.
(Noise)
(Applause)
(Protests)
(Protests)
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is my proposal.
(Applause)
Is this now clear to everyone?
We are now in a difficult position.
We must resolve this situation.
We do not have such a document.
The President is right.
This is my conception of Europe.
This can happen very quickly.
That is your right.
There is a discrepancy here.
That is your task, Madam President.
(Applause)
I agree with Mr H√§nsch.
This is the best solution for everyone.
Equal treatment
Madam President, on a point of order.
I wish to make three brief points.
That is my first question.
I should like to have that confirmed.
Thank you, Mr Cox.
It is now 23.5 hours later.
Please, I beg you!
(Applause)
That is another issue.
We agree.
They would.
I would ask you to accept this request.
This really is a mess!
At what time will it start?
I have a right to know.
Trafficking in women
We must welcome and help them.
Mr President, it has already been said.
Men, girls and boys, are also involved.
It is a growing problem in the EU, too.
This should not happen.
We must listen to them.
Yet it is actually a denial of freedom.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
The debate will take place as proposed.
The exact time will be announced later.
Vote
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I do not want to have a debate on this.
I do not want to dig the rules up.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, on a point of order.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
This is a tidying-up exercise.
This seems a very enjoyable exercise.
I do not want to start another debate.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
That will be the agenda.
Mr President, on a point of order.
That was the point here!
That is correct.
So we will carry on with the debates.
This seems unacceptable to me.
We have agreed to vote at 6 p.m.
The house did that earlier.
That was a decision for the House.
You are right.
I said an hour.
It was a slip of the tongue.
Mr President, on a point of order.
What procedures have been put in place?
I have no information on this subject.
This cannot and will not happen.
Katiforis report (A5-0134/2000)

Two points have particularly shaken us.
Can you believe it?
Pom√©s Ruiz report (A5-0108/2000)
Goebbels report (A5-0135/2000)

Plooij-Van Gorsel report (A5-0131/2000)

Smet/Gr√∂ner report (A5-0125/2000)
.
Quite the reverse.

It is our duty to support them.
Equal treatment
Europe as a Community of values.
Racism is on the rise again.
We all have our local examples.
This has to stop.
It is a good text.
It is important legislation.
That is the first point.
This is what it is all about.
This will not be easy.
Welcome
Equal treatment (continuation)
The first is of a general nature.
This is unacceptable.
The other vital area is religion.
Twenty years on, it is now coming true.
We are here discussing this directive.
This would be a gain, in my view.
And on time!
It is very pleasing to see this.
She has achieved a great deal.
Yes, I asked Mr Sylla to slow down.
It has been a long time coming.
Yet a few clearly have darker motives.
Those who lie down with dogs get fleas.
I welcome the directive.
That will not be easy or painless.
It will encourage abuse.
Posturing is easy.
Motivations are many and varied.
We have some - we can improve ours.
The time is right to do so.
We are more than a trading block.
It is not perfect.
The debate is closed.
Topical and urgent debate
Sierra Leone
There are apparently about 360 of them.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6 p.m.
Sri Lanka
The fighting has to stop.
This is a scourge which affects us all.
This situation must change.
The resolution is clear.
Something has to change.
The LTTE has to be stopped.
I know Sri Lanka, I have been there.
That goes back longer than last May.
We all hope that it ends very soon.
Human rights

Equatorial Guinea

Why?
The reform process in Iran is at risk.
Burma
There is talk of forced labour.
This is the core of our request.
This is wrong for several reasons.
Despite that, is there still a risk?
So, be sporting!
Therefore, please withdraw your motion.
Moving on to Equatorial Guinea.
I turn to Burma.
I would just like to add one point.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6 p.m.
Mr President, on a point of order.
We have a Members bar in Brussels.
I hope we can have some clarification.
Thank you, Mr Sturdy.
Your point is well made.
That debate has been concluded.
So we have finished that whole section.
I do not want lots of debates.
We were going to discuss Guatemala.
Let us move forward now to the vote.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Vote
Everyone is entitled to this.

We must go further and legislate.
We must lead the way in this fight.
That concludes the vote.
Trafficking in women (continuation)
Women and children are involved.
This report is very good.
Thirdly: the victims' rights.
But who are the clients?
That concludes the debate.
Readmission of third country nationals
This is bordering on blackmail.
Why not?
Are there any comments?
This will obviously be corrected.
There are no further comments.
(The Minutes were approved)
Vote
That is all I wished to say.
I appealed to the House to act fairly.
Mr Duff, do you uphold your request?
Indeed, it is quite complicated.
Before the start of the vote
(19 Members rose)
President.
The request is withdrawn.
Relating to Amendment No 10
I endorse this amendment.
I apologise for the lack of clarity.
Non-NAFO vessels
This really has to stop.
There is no way of enforcing the law.
This is why it is so popular.
For Greece it is Cyprus and Panama.
The Council refused.
The debate is closed.
Quantity instead of quality?
How many would be decommissioned?
How many were scrapped?
How many were sunk and so on?
We can improve our resources.
This is highly technical.
The same applies to trains or trucks.
There is no need for it.
It is called "Seascapes".
I hope that was not true.
That concludes the debate.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
We will ensure that is enforced.
Insurance
What is going on here then?
This cannot be right, Mr President!
I will, of course, check ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting closed at 11.30 a.m.)
Thank you.
Are there any comments?
We shall clarify the matter.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
I now have another statement to make.
Yesterday Mr Lannoye moved to ...
(Interruption by Mr Brok)
Mr Lannoye, that goes without saying!
Decision on urgent procedure
.
Thank you.
Mrs Schierhuber has asked to speak.
President.
President.
Mr Korakas on a point of order.
European political parties
But what is European awareness?
This is not just a question of money.
We shall comply with these demands.
This seems a rhetorical question to me.
First, there are European parties.
Europe is not a nation; it is nations.
Parties of parties are not democracy.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Security and defence
All that remains is Article 5.
It is still our aim.
I welcome the report by Mrs Lalumi√®re.
We had the Pleven plan.
We had de Gasperi.
We had Fouchet.
This time we have to make a difference.
Their plans are clear.
I would like to specify two.
One is the EU' s say.
I would like to make one final point.
Military is what the USA does best.
I think it is a fairly typical figure.
Such an approach would lead to failure.
It is about intervention.
Obviously not.
We do not want this.
Thank you, Catherine Lalumi√®re.
Please face reality.
We must try to shape it positively.
A small-scale NATO is emerging.
This mainly relates to the government.
We need to address that.

It is a remarkable achievement.
In fact, four issues are at stake.
This is somewhat disingenuous.
But this apparently is not enough.
We too share these concerns.
Welcome
Vote
Is this allowed under our Rules?
It mentions the "President of Canada".
There is no president of Canada.
Dell' Alba (TDI).
Simplified procedure - without report
(Parliament approved the initiative)
(The President cut the speaker off)
I would like to add something further.

Beysen recommendation (A5-0153/2000)
But to what end?
Maaten Report (A5-0156/2000)
Only once, Mr President.
'And when was that?' you may ask.
All cigarettes are harmful.
None do any good.
No man is an island.
.
Snuff is addictive.
.
.
.
.
I am disappointed it was not accepted.
This is simply not true.
But the jobs will be lost here.
Berenguer Fuster report (A5-0142/2000)
Lulling report (A5-0144/2000)

And who was that?
.
Special UN conference: Women 2000

But back to Europe.
I should also like to thank Mrs Smet.
This is not in our legislation.
Please answer me, Mr Patten.
You were not in New York, but I was.
This is greatly disappointing.
The fight goes on.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I have always supported women's rights.
It must be an error.
I am sorry about that.
The debate is closed.
If Poland tells us that it is free...

You are quite right, Mr President.
And this is the moment to do so.
He seems to be obsessed by them.
We do not work in this way.
It is the projection of stability.
What are we trying to do there?
I would like to make two comments.
This is something we know about.
This is an extremely serious matter.
Which is why we cannot do without it.
The Balkans are not our only priority.
Thank you, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
China's accession to WTO
It is good news all round.
This is a good news story.
So the results are clear.
This simply cannot carry on.
Thirdly, technical assistance.
Finally, human rights.
We should be all the more robust.
Another matter is that of human rights.
In what way is Wei Jingsheng mistaken?
That was a very bad mistake.
The debate is closed.
Everybody supports this matter.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0434/00):

(The President cut the speaker off)
This is my personal view.
Question No 3 by (H-0446/00):
Is the Council aware of this study?
Question No 4 by (H-0449/00):
I received its reply today.
Question No 5 by (H-0450/00):
This is an important point.
My question is quite specific.
Question No 6 by (H-0451/00):

Question No 7 by (H-0454/00):


Question No 8 by (H-0457/00):
How can we avoid this?
It is as simple as that.
There should be no doubt on this.
Question No 9 by (H-0458/00):
Everything is open here in Parliament.
Question No 10 by (H-0460/00):
Question No 11 by (H-0462/00):
Question No 12 by (H-0466/00):
Is that the case?
Question No 13 by (H-0471/00):
Question No 14 by (H-0474/00):
This is not a matter for the Council.
Why?
Only time?
Why must the 14 Member States change?
May you achieve much for Europe!
Change to the agenda
Is there any objection to the proposal?
(Parliament gave its assent)
Reconstruction of Central America
I would like to highlight four issues.
In this respect, two facts worry us.
This process was a success.
We all know that full well.
We just cannot say for certain.
I only wish there were not.
It is now June 2000.
I consider that to be far too long.
.
These problems have now been overcome.
The debate is closed.
Asylum procedures
He speaks from the heart.
Assert yourself in your party.
I am not judging that.
That is something else entirely.
That is a huge step forward for us.
Then there was the Tampere Summit.
What needs to happen now?
All sorts of things need to happen.
Tempus fugit!
There are difficulties at hand though.
No.
Solidarity must be for all.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Crime victims in the EU
Why is this so necessary?
We have embarked upon a new process.
This is excellent.
I also urge it be ambitious.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Late payment in commercial transactions

However, I am at a disadvantage.
It is a bitter pill to swallow.
Nothing more, nothing less.
It is a sensational result.
Congratulations!

The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)
Thank you, Mrs Buitenweg.
I was speaking personally.
I do not think I abused my position.
It really is absolutely unacceptable.
We will try to put an end to it.
We make virtually no use of it at all.
Mrs Pack is quite right.
Are there any comments?
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
European Council of 19/20 June 2000
We await the responses with confidence.

That is a crucial point for us as well.
That is a second point.
Progress has already been made.
Finally, the fiscal package.
Thank you, Mr Barnier.
That is the first challenge.
I would like to add one more thought.
We deeply appreciate that.
We in my group very much believe that.
That is intolerable.
In our opinion, this is very welcome.
Its content is not in question.
Then Europe could be some use for once.
This is now proving an improbable task.
But these are two parallel exercises.
First we must work on the content.
That is our main task.
Thank you again, Portuguese Presidency.

This has been a constant concern.
Thank you, Minister.

It will take the initiative.
That is what we are doing after Lisbon.
I am not just saying complete them.
I am talking about success.
Success in Nice.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
It is a very poignant birthday for her.
In March, her husband died of cancer.
(Applause)
Good, we have taken note of this.
Vote
I have consulted the services involved.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
With regard to paragraph 38:
Thank you, Mrs McCarthy.
I have taken due note of this.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Murphy Report (A5-0154/2000)
Maaten Report (A5-0160/2000)
I voted against this measure.
I do not think so!
I therefore voted against the motion.
Parliament has spoken very clearly.
Thank you for your reaction.
On that account I did not vote for it.
That is why I felt I had to abstain.
The very future of Europe is at stake.
Shame on the sorcerer' s apprentices!
This is unacceptable to us.
Since then little has changed.
.
After all, what has changed in Austria?
Has the government fallen?

Naturally, it is a complex business.
The debate is closed.
Topical and Urgent Debate
Basic freedoms in Serbia and Kosovo
Thank you.
That is the picture in Serbia.
That much should be clear to us.
That is what we have to concentrate on.
The independent media are thwarted.
A very negative trend is setting in.
Politicians are under threat.
There is a murderous atmosphere.
The assaults are relentless.
CCL recently branded them terrorists.
The opposition in Serbia needs us.
We have some opportunities here.
Help them.
They are despondent and fearful.
We have been doing that for years.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Coup d'√©tat in Paraguay
There is nothing separating us on that.
The Paraguayan people never gave in.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.

(Applause)
Vote (continuation)
That is exactly what was on my list.
We now come to the final vote.
They have already been voted upon.

Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).

But freedom of speech must be upheld!
I am genuinely perplexed.
Cohesion Fund (1998)
However, certain issues must be raised.
I share this concern.
This was not by chance, Mrs Sch√∂rling.
The debate is closed.
It is extremely important.
This is welcome.
That is a lot of money.
My group will of course support it.
That alone is not enough.
I very much doubt it.
We will be glad to support you on this.
The debate is closed.
Nuts and locust beans
Brussels does not want to be involved.
We are importing.
We must prevent a rural exodus.
That is quite right.
You cannot be right on both counts.
You cannot have it both ways!
(The sitting was closed at 8.15 p.m.)
Mr President, on a point of order.
I should also like to say this.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We will certainly note your suggestion.
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Vote
Decisions are far too centralised.
This is a political issue.
They have done a good, serious job.
They have asked very serious questions.
That must be our starting-point.
They want to address this problem.
There needs to be more progress.
Let me comment on that first of all.
I myself come from Sweden.
The joint debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Report (A5-0147/2000)

Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Application of Community law (1998)
.
I therefore support this amendment.
A general campaign is needed here.
And so indeed it must.
That is wrong; they voted in favour.
But I must admit my mistake.
.
I was at a conference last week.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE

Adjournment of the session

Resumption of the session
Tribute
Pierre Pflimlin was a true statesman.

Statement by the President
This was on 18 June.
Action must be taken now.
This bill has not yet been adopted.
There has been a change of power there.
Thank you, Mr Blak.
Agenda
Here the issue is Tibet.
We know how important this is.
(Parliament rejected the request)
President.

Everyone has heard the suggestion.
This also applies here, to Iraq.
All the issues are covered.
I am rather torn.
We wanted to have fewer overall.
But I will be brief.
European Council/Portuguese presidency
Thank you, Mr President.
(Applause)
(Laughter)
We welcome the positive outcome.
I just want to add a couple of points.
(Applause)
Fine.
Free elections.
Today there is growing embarrassment.
We shall see!
What kind of madness is this?
We must tackle the issue of China.
We cannot ask Mr Solana questions.
Why does this matter?
This must be noted.
I hope not.
We have shared values.
Our citizens expect something more.
.
The Lisbon Summit laid down a strategy.
I would like to make it quite clear...
Money laundering
This has now been done.
This would make the job impossible.
We rectify this in the amendments.
But there are also exceptions.
A great deal of work needs to be done.
They have been particularly successful.
We should learn from that experience.
The situation has changed.
This is called money laundering.
It must not come to that!
The debate is closed.
Safe harbour privacy principles
We do not have that option.
What is our intention?
But you would have my support, anyway.
Let us turn now to the Safe Harbour.
And it is going to work.
Lastly, cancellation.
I will end, Mr President.
If we do that, then what will happen?
They have their way and we have ours.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Visas
, rapporteur.
We then instituted legal action.
We see this as a step forward.
What is this?
I rejected this.
Now it is the Council's turn.
Amendment No. 2 is important.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 9.45 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
Yesterday evening I raised two points.
I do not see that minuted.
Could you change that please?
But things cannot go on like this.
Thank you, Mr Camre.
(The Minutes were approved)
1998 discharge
The next item is the joint debate on:
We are responding to that request.
You insisted on it, we are responding.
Round one to us, the anti-PPE alliance.
She lost.
Round two to the anti-PPE alliance.
Round three to the anti-PPE alliance.
Can you give us these figures, please?
We lack regulation.
I think we have done an excellent job.
This practice has been appalling.
It is a matter of some importance.
We shall therefore grant the discharge.
Let us reject it tomorrow.
But where to now?
(Applause from the right)
That is my first point.
(Loud applause)
It is a success.
We all have the Dover tragedy in mind.
This is precisely what is at issue.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
This is an absolute priority!
(Loud applause)
(Loud Applause)
We certainly agree with that.
This reform must be ambitious.
(Applause)
Is that not right, Mr Cohn-Bendit?
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is not acceptable.
I said this to Mr Prodi.
That goes without saying.

(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
If it is possible, so much the better.
My response is similar.
There is no doubt about it.
(Applause)
I have just answered this.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
So, there has been some progress.
Europe is open, by definition.
(Laughter and applause)

(Laughter and applause)
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
We shall carry on with our debate.


We need progress here.
This would be a great disappointment.
Who does what?
That is precisely the problem!
That is the funny side of it.
It must be launched at Nice.
There is a lot one can agree with.
Where exactly does the EU stand?
What was the reason for its action?
Global warming is one such problem.
We support these proposals.
This depends on what you mean.
We are leaving it for the future.
I leave that question open.
I will end here.
Let us focus on the task in hand.
Our position is quite clear.
Thank you very much.
They have all done a magnificent job.
Zimbabwe is plainly at a crossroads.
It can thus now go ahead.
Hopefully this will change.
People did vote in great numbers.
I pay great tribute to him.
Mr Mugabe has much to answer for.
All these things must be stopped.
Thank you very much, Minister
The debate is closed.
Trafficking in human beings
Unfortunately, however, they do exist.
Unfortunately they are nothing new.
It is high time we adopted policy.
So what should we do?
It is time for action!
I, like all of you, am deeply shocked.
These are terrifying figures.
How then, can we put an end to this?
That is the question.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We do not wish to fall into this trap.
So what is to be done?
All of this is interconnected.
This appalling incident was avoidable.
And their prospects?
I have experienced this first hand.
They are scarred for life.
They cannot go back.
But these are not enough.
I think that this would be unrealistic.

The debate is closed.
1998 discharge (continuation)
The debate is closed.
LIFE
Congratulations to the rapporteur.
That concludes the debate.
2001 budget (conciliation procedure)
.
That is only just now coming through.
But we maintain a sense of realism.
No more, no less.
I have two final observations.
Let us get that point clear.
They have failed to do that.
That makes it pretty difficult.
My groups welcomes this development.
Just imagine.
That is no way to make progress.
Let us not push things to the limit.
That concludes the joint debate.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0518/00):
Question No 2 by (H-0519/00):
Is the Council aware of this scheme?
Council.
Thank you for your response, Minister.
Question No 3 by (H-0525/00):
Question No 4 by (H-0531/00):

That is the nub of the problem.
Question No 6 by (H-0539/00):
Is yours the same interpretation?
Question No 8 by (H-0545/00):
Question No 9 by (H-0552/00):
These are short-term teething troubles.
Subject: International Criminal Court
Question No 12 by (H-0556/00):
Question No 16 by (H-0565/00):
Question No 17 by (H-0569/00):
I wish you every success.
I am also suffering.

And no-one wants that.
We need 20 million.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
Liberalisation of energy markets
My fourth point concerns regulators.
I hope that will be supported.
It is up to them to decide.
Perhaps it is afraid.
Secondly, the value of a timetable.
Energy is a basic need.
That is the first thing.
Mr Mombaur pointed that out just now.
Professor Monti has announced this.
I do not think that it, in fact, is.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Community railway undertakings
We are most grateful for that.
We talk about globalisation.
There are two schools of thought here.
But the Council must also show willing.
They either have to change or die.
That is an achievable goal.
Let us not throw it away.
I do not really share Mr Watts' view.
Secondly, who can apply for a licence?
In fact, safety should come first.
The fewer bodies involved, the better.
I speak for my own country of Ireland.
I could not agree more.
Who can argue with that?
The figures speak for themselves.
One step at a time gets you nowhere.
By far the biggest is road transport.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
It is time for improvements here.
Thank you for listening.
This is extremely important.
I am very happy to support this report.
But the devil is in the detail.
But people no longer understand this.
Is this a citizens' Europe?
Is this a common market?
These are the questions.
This concludes my response.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
I shall look into this.
(The Minutes were approved)
ECB annual report
We are aware of these shortcomings.
Secondly, the euro is a new currency.
First, the 1999 annual report.
(The President cut the speaker off)
His efforts are commendable.
Its message is doomed to failure.
Theirs was no easy task.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(Applause)
This is also important.
Thank you, Mr Duisenberg.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Implementation of EMU
It was very successful at that point.
That is my first point.
Or, in a nutshell, manipulation.
We will not be manipulated.
This is a most deplorable report.
The changeover will require an effort.
I certainly wish the euro well.
Vote
F√§rm (PSE), rapporteur.
This has also been the case this time.
Yes or no?

Implementation of EMU (continuation)
The very idea is absurd.
Two additional comments.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
But anyway, it is now before us.
Was it done in a balanced way?
The answer is no-one.
So, what does the CSTEE say about this?
You can cry wolf once too often.
No, we do not.
We subsidise it with millions of euros.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Beef and beef products
This endeavour started four years ago.
I will now comment on the amendments.
Clearly this is a ridiculous situation.
This is a subsidiarity issue.
There is no time for conciliation.
However, we are almost at the end.
The Commission knows why.
We have done that with a good grace.
We are not prepared to do that.
Let us hear them.
This is where we need to get to.
The whole itinerary?
Or just 'Origin: European Union' ?
So, today, we are offered a compromise.
Soon labels will no longer suffice.
I will make a prediction.
Mr Chirac is going to be disappointed.
The people are despairing.
I cannot support its inclusion.
How is 'origin' to be defined here?
Exactly how will origin be indicated?
Where was the animal born?
That is not the case in my country.
They are confusing.
This is not acceptable.
The French situation is amazing.
It is not even a food safety issue.
So they know what they have to do.
This took place on 3 May.
That is the effect it would have.
That is all.
Surely that is not the idea.
You see, it can work!
That concludes the debate.
That is an ambitious goal.
We cannot have it both ways.
We cannot have our cake and eat it.
I would like to ask him four questions.
Would this cause a real problem?
Is that a problem?
Question Time (Commission)
First part
Question No 25 by (H-0549/00):
We all want to combat cyber crime.
Nobody has yet found the right answer.
Question No 27 by (H-0543/00):
Question No 28 by (H-0555/00):
Commission.
Question No 30 by (H-0524/00):
Question No 31 by (H-0540/00):
This is clear to everybody.
Question No 32 by (H-0567/00):
Thankfully they were safely evacuated.
Well that did not hurt, did it?
Why?
Question No 33 by (H-0573/00):
So we are quite pleased.
Thank you very much, Mr Nielson.
Questions to Mr Barnier
That is one part of my reply.
I am not a fatalist.
That is our problem.
Question No 37 by (H-0544/00):
Questions to Mrs Wallstr√∂m
I prefer education.
Question No 42 by (H-0521/00):
But the question remains.
Of course we are worried.
Question No 44 by (H-0547/00):
Commission.
Commission.
Commission.
Question No 45 by (H-0548/00):

We will not sit on our hands.
EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme)
That surely serves no purpose at all.
That, to my mind, is far too frequent.
EMAS is complex, too complex.
It really is an essential instrument.
EMAS is, however, a voluntary system.
Thank you, Madam Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Commissioner Wallstr√∂m.
The debate is closed.
Environmental inspections
I recognise the Commission's worries.
Why do they not know?
A recommendation will do no good.
They get inspected. Action is taken.
It is simply unfair.
We do not want to see this abandoned.
We want to see results.
Thank you, Commissioner Wallstr√∂m.
The debate is closed.
Protection of forests
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you very much, Mr President.
We need more fires.
We set fires for ecological reasons.
It is therefore extremely important.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
We note that with gratitude.
The debate is closed.
MEDIA/MEDIA Plus
We need two additional instruments.
We have concentrated on the key points.
Big cinema needs big money.
The plan is indeed sound.
I do wonder.
This is hardly ever discussed.
That must change.
I think not.
Firstly, why do we need this programme?
Why do we need it?
I believe we are able to do that.
I do not think this is the case.
That system is completely obsolete.
We need to very careful about that.
This needs to be re-emphasised.
Thank you very much, Mrs Hieronymi.
We are working to recreate such a fund.
So I need not go over it again.
The debate is closed.
Quality evaluation in school education
Often education attracts fine words.
Quality evaluation is one of those.
No child is devoid of talent.
What are those standards?
How have they been established?
We shall vote on our report tomorrow.
This is the path we must pursue.
That is already the case.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)
Are there any comments?
Has he no shame?
Has he no respect?
Has he no decency or honour at all?
So far, he has refused to comment.
Very well, Mr Seguro.
Certainly, Mr Lehne.
And I am quite happy to support it.
(Laughter and applause)
(The Minutes were approved)
Welcome
Thank you for your attention.
I wish to express our thanks.
That is not unusual.
I commend the report to the House.
They want to be active citizens.
I turn now to the Ombudsman.
In that he has our full support.
I would like to state seven principles.
Thank you for your work!
By nature they tend to be secretive.
It is simply not good enough.
The committee work can start.
This is now before Parliament.
Thank you kindly, Mr S√∂derman.
The debate is closed.
Single European sky
We cannot put it off any longer.
It needs attention now.
That may be right for us.
It may be wrong for others.
This cannot last any longer.
We must address this issue now.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Nor is that in any way a problem.
Consider the facts.
Why?
But that is not what is being proposed.
The system is highly effective.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Passengers go missing.
The issue of Eurocontrol is important.
(The President cut the speaker off)
First of all, the matter of safety.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I share this ambition.
Let me remind you of another aspect.

That is the timetable.
Let us not get into this argument.
That is not the aim of this initiative.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Health and safety of pregnant workers
Here we must avoid any risks.
We have a good example of this here.
I am not so sure.
It needs to be re-done.
This is completely unacceptable!
How much detail should we go into?
I have not been consulted about this.
And so I am stuck!
I have taken note of your request.
That would be something else!
We shall now proceed to the vote.

Now, we have to wait.
It is a waste of time.
Could you clarify that?
This is not the case.
What sort of a statement is this?
Topical and urgent debate
Fiji and the Solomon Islands
Why did it happen?
The parliament was not functioning.
This situation is unsustainable.
We created dialogue.
That aid is 25% of their GDP.
Today, the reality is far sadder.
The concerns expressed are very real.
That has been abolished.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.

Situation in the Moluccas
Death penalty in the United States
This year, this demand was repeated.

Hooliganism
Mr President, football is a festival.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
It is absolutely not worth it.
This inquiry is under way.
Iraq
He is still there ten years later.
Is this also being distributed?
Yes, of course.
Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990.
This was wrong and unacceptable.
The UN action was justified.
It is extremely important.
We cannot lose sight of them either.
Allow me to be more specific.
Hence my explicit vote against.
That is all.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Venezuela
Only a few roads have been cleared.
This aid is directed at two things.
The results are now before us.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Now he (H√§ider) is threatening us."
But he is not threatening anybody.
It is quite normal.
(Applause)
That is a disgraceful attitude!
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Therefore the signature can stand.
Before the vote on Venezuela:
I fully understand what you are saying.
The President has already replied.
I do not want any further debate.
We will look into this matter.

There was broad agreement in committee.
It still have not replied to that.
Transport policy requires choices.
That is the problem.
But it is doing well.
It will even be more in the 2000.
We will increase the share up to 50%.
Mrs Peijs, thank you for your work.
Thank you very much, Mr MacCormick.
Civil dialogue
Mr Pronk has the floor.
This is not the issue.
Speed is the main issue.
Mr President, I can be extremely brief.

Our attempts have been ignored.
We need time for this.
Mr President, that has to change.
That is quite fundamental.
(The sitting was closed at 9.08 p.m.)
This has been noted.
This will be done.
Vote

Combating serious environmental crime


How is this to happen?
That is extremely important.
This may be found in Amendment 25.
Who has misled whom?
Moreover it is not just companies.
It was taken to court in India.
This cannot be allowed to continue.
I am in no doubt about this.
This is also included.
Are there any comments?

(The Minutes were approved)
Adjournment of the session

The whole is the only real truth.
(The President cut the speaker off)

Tribute
Madam President, on a point of order.
Mr Murphy, I note your statement.
I would ask you to speak to Air France.
You all received a questionnaire.
Thank you, Mrs Gillig.

They do have freedom of speech.
These are therefore important matters.
Agenda
The next item is the order of business.
Relating to Monday:
Relating to Tuesday:
(Applause)
But we do not insist on this.
Relating to Wednesday:
President.
The votes were always controversial.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
Relating to Thursday: President.
(Parliament gave its assent)
MEDA
Many reasons have been given for this.
I prefer to look forward.
We agree absolutely with this.
(The President cut the speaker off.)
(The President cut the speaker off)
It would be good to move on from here.
Mr Patten, stick to your guns!
We have no clear policy on this issue.
.
Let me make two final points.
That is simply not tolerable.
The joint debate is closed.
Common Community diplomacy
What is the real issue here?

These are the real questions.
The opposite is true.
We also need policies.
We abolish national embassies.
This is all about competition.
There is an urgent need for this.
Let us continue along these lines.
What is this really about?
A final plea.
The debate is closed.
The reason for that is simple.

We need to be candid.
The debate is closed.
Community humanitarian activities
We must address this problem urgently.
.
That is important.
That is our clear and ambitious goal.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 9.15 p.m.)
Welcome
There can be no greater contradiction.
The Middle East
Camp David opened up new possibilities.
That is our position.
We are approaching a deadline.
What, then, do these decisions imply?
Israel is opposed to this.
They are not demanding west Jerusalem.
On the contrary.
There are precedents for this.
But that is not enough.
This is the price for peace.
Now the taboo has been broken.
Peace is necessary.
That would be ideal.
Equally clearly, time is running out.
What does this role involve?
I too wish for a more active Europe.
What does this role involve?
It constantly encourages negotiation.
That concludes the debate.
EU external action priorities
All these dimensions apply.
I am thinking here of Asia.

Are the structures genuinely suitable?
We shall now suspend the sitting.
We all know what the problem is.
Let us proceed to the vote.
Vote
(Laughter and applause)
Explanations of vote

Pi√©trasanta report (A5-0205/2000)
What are you doing to help us?"
Galeote Quecedo report (A5-0210/2000)
.
This is a typically Marxist approach.
Imbeni report (A5-0191/2000)
This is unacceptable!
Has the money released been squandered?
I do not think so.
I utterly repudiate this.
Are there any comments?
The right to exist as Basque.
I would like to amend it.
That is my protest.
I am taking note of this now.
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
Are there any objections to this?
Mr Poettering, Parliament is sovereign.
Are there any objections?
Then the decision is as stated.
In my opinion, there are two:
That is what this is all about!
If so, I can support this.
This concept I wholeheartedly reject.
But this is only half the problem.
The debate is closed.
Financial year 2001
Our findings are now available to you.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
There is not a great deal to add here.
So far, so good.
No revision!
That is the name of the game.
The Commissioner made the same point.
Its aim is to reduce expenditure.
Aids
Beyond Africa, the pandemic is global.
New commitment is necessary.
We are convinced of that.
Several initiatives have been launched.
I think the facts, today, are simple.
We talk a very great deal about Africa.
The time for thinking really is over.
We will meet the challenge together.
.
Prevention works, but it takes time.
Uganda is a good illustration of this.
We are supporting this.
A cure is still far too expensive.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Madam President.
What is the role of this mechanism?
That is not the case at all.
Your resolution is factually incorrect.
But perhaps I am a hopeless optimist.
I was really taken aback by this.
I do hope this time is the last time.
We need to take a more consistent line.
This would be the best way forward.
This is a key point.
We must not monitor and prevent it.
And all for what?
But we have not solved the problem.
We have simply postponed it.
I put two questions to colleagues.
I think not.
I am sure it would.
.
I find that approach interesting.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
You know that we have very little time.
Question No 2 by (H-643/00):

Question No 3 by (H-0627/00):
Council.
Question No 4 by (H-0697/00):
They are known to Austria at least.
Question No 5 by (H-0597/00):

And if so, when?
It is not an easy task.
Question No 6 by (H-0605/00):
It is strictly limited to agriculture.
Question No 7 by (H-0610/00):
What is the Council' s reply to Mr Gem?
That is the general rule.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Question No 8 by (H-0614/00):
Question No 9 by (H-0616/00):
This is a crucial issue of democracy.
It does not operate in a vacuum.
Question No 10 by (H-0617/00):

Question No 11 by (H-0619/00):
Question No 12 by (H-0622/00):
Yes.
Question No 13 by (H-0624/00):
Question No 14 by (H-0625/00):
Quite the opposite.
That concludes Question to the Council.
There is a Kurdish problem in Turkey.
Is there really a problem here?
You mentioned the Corsican problem.
The death penalty was mentioned.
Take a look at Turkey.
It is a law unto itself.
It radiates crisis on every side.
The debate is closed.
Thirdly, television in Europe.
My group will vote accordingly.
I am not calling for quotas.
But what does this mean?
Perhaps Mr Veltroni could enlighten us.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I commend it to the House.
Admittedly, there are problems.
What conclusions can we draw from this?
I will give you an example at random.
The debate is closed.
Fisheries agreements
Allow me to explain what I mean.
My reason for doing so was simple.
But that is not enough.
By any standards, this is preposterous.
I believe it is a sound agreement.
Why do these differences exist?
Many thanks for your attention.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.25 p.m.)
Annex - formal sitting
(Applause)
What were our positions?
(Loud and sustained applause)
Today is better than tomorrow".
Europe for us is democracy.
Europe for us is enlightenment.
Europe for us is parliamentarism.
Europe for us is culture.
Europe for us is economy.
Look at this man.
Thank God we are there.
But it will happen.
The Middle East has been no exception.
Mine is my religious belief.
Yes, I know it is an oxymoron.
What do I mean?
How can he go home?
Let us explore it.
We have a goal.
We are going somewhere.
You raise the issue of refugees.
It is not a unilateral issue.
My mother was a refugee from Hebron.
Israel has a relatively good economy.
(Loud and sustained applause)
We now know the essence of the issue.
Everyone will do what they think best.
Right to family reunification
I wish to congratulate her on that.
Thank you for your attention.
This seems to us perverse.
Immigration is not a problem.
(Applause from the right)
This is utterly false.
I respect the opinions of all Members.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Movement and residence of EU citizens
What evidence must be provided?
In what circumstances I cannot imagine.
The same would apply to students.
So why does the Right ignore this?
It is not too much to ask.
Sadly, this is very often not the case.
It is a very good report.
I agree with Mr Tannock in principle.
Commissioner Vitorino has the floor.
We are currently working on this.
The debate is closed.
This is a major and important issue.
This is indefensible in my view.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We can go along with this.
Thank you very much, Mr Jarzembowski.
But the sea is our primary concern.
This is an important step.
That much is absolutely clear.
It is a step forward.
Thank you very much, Mrs de Palacio.
The debate is closed.

Thank you, Mrs Terr√≥n i Cus√≠.
.
Thank you, Mr Watson.
That is very clear.
I promise to think about it.
Before the start of the vote
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the start of the vote
I do not see any sign of them doing so.
This is prejudicing the northern model.
Let us make no bones about it.
Morillon recommendation (A5-0206/2000)
Sch√∂rling report (A5-0196/2000)
We say no to this.
This is why I voted for this report.
Europe is going to expand eastwards.
This is written in Agenda 2000.
Why?
In my view, that is not a good move.
Watson report (A5-0201/2000)
.
But how is the family to be defined?
This is an unacceptable situation.
You are therefore free to go.
I do not understand the problem.

Heaton-Harris report (A5-0199/2000)
.
Boumediene-Thiery report (A5-0207/2000)
Are there any comments?
I did not state that.
That is important.
It is merely a possibility.
Is that clear?
That was the problem.
Right now there is no problem.
That is why I cannot say...
We adopt the Minutes.
So if you have a problem ...
That is all.
(The Minutes were approved)
Telecommunications mergers
That is extremely important.
At that time, comparisons were made.
For the good of ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
The reverse is often true.
This is indeed one of our key concerns.
Size can sometimes create problems.
I must be very brief at this stage.
This raises two issues.
The debate is closed.
Human cloning
But what was the real message?
We have no alternative.
(Applause)
I simply refuse to accept this.
(Applause)
Turning now to the facts of the matter.
(Heckling)
Please do not get excited.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
(Applause)
That is the key objective.
That is the message we must drive home.
(Applause)
That cannot be substantiated.
(Applause)
Nothing is more important than this.
This is not serious enlargement work.
Then you will have us all on your side.
Well, it is not too late.
I am only too pleased to do so.....
(Heckling from the Chamber)
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
Human cloning (continuation)
Scientific advances are mind-boggling.
His dream has a name: eugenics.
This dream is in fact a nightmare.
They are people.
This is less than two years ago.
He wants to be the creator.
This is completely wrong.
No one doubts that either.
I suspect not.
And what form has this reaction taken?
Our vote will set this in train.
What is this really about?
This conflicts with human rights.
What status does the embryo have?
Could they not provide new life?
There must be an in-depth debate.
You have called for one and we agree.
Safeguards are crucial.
It really struck a chord with me.
No one has a monopoly on ethics.
Everyone could cite examples of this.
There are certainly boundaries.
We still have time.
So let us get some facts straight.
So we come down to the basic dilemma.
The choice is yours, colleagues.
What does respect for life mean?
Where do the stem cells come from?
Should embryos be cloned?
.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Question No 41 by (H-0613/00):
These problems have several causes.

Something must be done.
Questions to Mr Vitorino
Question No 46 by (H-0600/00):
I will answer with pleasure.
Question No 47 by (H-0606/00):
I am currently awaiting this report.
What are your views on this?
Question No 49 by (H-0692/00):

Questions to Mr Fischler
Question No 58 by (H-0602/00):
Question No 59 by (H-0609/00):
Question No 61 by (H-0618/00):

You are right in principle.
Question No 62 by (H-0633/00):
It is quite ironic really.
Water policy
More needs to be done about this.
I think we can be proud of this.
This should be provided for by law.
Will we achieve this objective?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
End-of-life vehicles
I believe it will do so.
That is the crucial thing.
Many thanks, Mr President.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Air transport and the environment
Aviation is massively subsidised.
This does not spell the end of ICAO.
Others do just the same thing.
That is nonsense.
So I commend this report to you.
It is not subsidised.
I would like to highlight a few points.
We cannot accept this.
The eco-tax will solve nothing.
So let us be realistic, please.
We should however urge caution.
We only have two manufacturers.
Air fares would go up.
I mean her original version.
A long journey is a long way to go.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Tyres for motor vehicles and trailers
This seems ample time to me.
On the contrary.
In fact we do more, and we do it worse.
Now turning to tyres.
It has consulted with the industry.
Let me speak plainly.
We are being far too prescriptive.
Mr President, I welcome this proposal.
It is long overdue.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
That is the purpose of Amendment No 3.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Undeclared work
What is the heart of the problem?
Many thanks for your attention.
Or look at Scandinavia.
This is not true!
What should we do?
That is the heart of the matter.
What is to be done?
Acting illegally is anti-social.
Changes take time.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Thank you, Mr R√ºbig.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Sport
The next item is the joint debate on:
Sport forms a whole.
We need cohesion throughout the Union.
They too will be making proposals.
Finally, I will mention penalties.
Therefore, keep going, Commissioner.
Let me turn to the facts now.
There is the training of sportspeople.
How can the sporting ethic be restored?
The cure is worse than the disease.
Formula 1 is a good example.
Europe needs friends, not enemies.
Sport has a huge potential.
Why?
Why?
I think we are at a turning point.
I think that is a pity.
I wish it every luck.
Let me stress that I am saying a part.
The world of sport comes first.
(Applause)
I do not think so.
There is no miracle cure.
I will tell you my personal views.
That is not our aim.
(Applause)
Why 2004?

Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.

TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Nuclear submarine accidents
Their names are no secret.
Why has nothing been done about it?
The answer is simple.
In fact, the reactor was closed down.
May this serve as a warning to Europe.
Russia is also financially responsible.
They deserve our solidarity.
The docks in Gibraltar are type 'Z' .
This is at the heart of our resolution.
It is, in fact, downright impudent.
This is what our resolution is about.
We took two months.
I am concerned: is it that he is deaf?
Is it that he does not know what to do?
.
I find that quite natural.
The debate is closed.
Burundi
But the accord is not perfect.
The debate is closed.
Human rights
That is what we are doing here today.
That is not much.
Is that really impossible?
That has changed.
I hope that will change.
Nepal has already agreed.
Some movement is discernible.
Burma
That is the situation.
Unfortunately that is not the case.
And what happens?
Burma should be excluded.
That should be supported.
The EU has acted correctly here.
So what can we do?
His name was Ramiro Zapata.
Turkish bombing in the north of Iraq
War will never lead to peace.
The answer is no.
That is the fast track into the EU.
It is our responsibility to prevent it.
They have suffered enough.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Temel√≠n nuclear power station
Please just think about Chernobyl.
No.
I cannot vote for this policy.
But the conditions must be right.
But we also have the Euratom Treaty.
The answer is 'yes' .
The joint debate is closed.
Fires in Europe
So what proposals can we make?
We need to be pro-active.
What can the European Union do?
I will gladly do that, Mr Sakellariou
I got the message very well, Mr Wynn.
Commissioner Nielson has the floor.
The army plays a dubious role.
Ethnic tension is once again mounting.
Speight should not be let off the hook.
I would like clarity on that point.
The options are open.
We have both the stick and the carrot.
This is also the reply to Mrs Maes.
It is really tragic what is happening.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 6.40 p.m.)
Tribute
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Things have changed radically.
Learning has become broader and longer.
It is therefore a good cause.
Education...
(The President cut the speaker off)
It is only noughts and ones anyway.
(Laughter)
That is a pity.
That opportunity must be taken.
Success encourages further ambition.

The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Explanations of vote
.
Thank you, Mr Alyssandrakis.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 10.10 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Thank you, Mr Tajani.
I shall be very happy to do that.
This happened in Kassel.
Thank you.
Order of business
Yes, exactly.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Yes, I think that would be best.
However, something has to be done.
Energy is not cheap.
It is a scarce commodity.
It is now valued at only USD 0.85.
We were promised a strong currency.
Such prices are unacceptable.
They must translate into action.
(Applause from the right)
We have two choices.
Let us lower and enforce speed limits.
We do not need a new budget heading.
These heading exist.
Let us put more money in them.
That is all quite true.
That would lead nowhere.
What chance do we stand against this?
No.
It is high time this was changed.
We need to be less dependent.
We are still lacking such a policy.
There is no reason why they should be.
We can do all of these things.
We can use these opportunities.
(Heckling from Mr Jarzembowski)
We must be coherent.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I believe not.
I do not think it can.
This is completely unacceptable.
That is unreasonable.
The debate is closed.
Eurodac
I would be delighted if we could.
Why?
For two quite crucial reasons.
We are not one hundred percent happy.
The debate is closed.
Unfortunately, 1 000 are fatal.
This can largely be avoided.
It uses safety equipment and devices.
Inform us of any situation of risk.
(The President cut the speaker off)
When do they occur?
How do they happen?
What can we do to prevent them?
You cannot have red lights everywhere.
I am not happy on every count.
We want to Europeanise the economy.
We have the single currency.
Minimum standards mean subsidiarity.
It is not.
It is described as bureaucratic.
Is it onerous?
Is it burdensome?
Stop it now, please.
I welcome your broad support.
The debate is closed.
Competition rules
Firstly, I welcome this process.
That is what we have on the plus side.
Which market do we mean?
Change was therefore necessary.
The debate is closed.
That is a good thing, in my view.
The debate is closed.
Conditionality must have its place.
In fact the risk is considerable.
Experience has shown it.
We certainly do not share this view.
This, in my opinion, is a sine qua non.
I agree.
It is now up to the Member States.
This is a very good decision.
No Commissioner has tried that before.
I do not think this is the case.
The reform process is now moving.
The debate is closed.
Export refunds are not a subsidy.
This is deeply unfair.
These objectives are not under threat.
They have my unequivocal support.
Sugar is a case in point.
I am extremely pleased with it.
The second point concerns the budget.
Why?
Surely, this cannot be the argument.
The debate is closed.
I have covered the main aspects.
Let us look at this briefly.
It can lead to lower prices for them.
More work needs to be done in the area.
I know that no legislation is perfect.
We are consultees.
I hope that we will go further.
It has been a long and hard road.
I only do so when there is a reason.
We do not need to defer it any longer.
The world has moved on.
Allow me to explain why.
Let me illustrate this with an example.
I fundamentally disagree with that.
This is the broad legal framework.
I am referring here to Article 17.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)
(The President cut the speaker off)
We have taken note of your opinion.
I cannot believe what is going on!
We will see what we can do.
Terrorism in Spain
Mr Galeote, I hear what you are saying.
We expect him here any minute.
I hope my message is clear.

We have no others.
That is not true.

(Applause)
Hundreds of people have been killed.
(Loud protests and heckling)
(Continued protests)
(Protests, pounding on desks)
(Continuing protests)
(Applause)
We must never lose hope.
Mr President, that honours you greatly.
The debate is closed.
Racism
Our message must be an ambitious one.
We must be a role model.
The matter is far too serious for that.
History has borne this out.
How do we mobilise this majority?
(Applause from the left)
Which is worse?
This is the road to ruin.
I reject that.
I feel that is a very important sign.
The debate is closed.
Organised crime
Another broken promise.
I understand why it is happening.
This is how it goes.
This does not appear to be happening.
This is a missed opportunity.
The debate is closed.
No problem at all.
We, for our part, certainly are not.
Vote
Yet these are important amendments.
Mr President, on a point of order.
(Parliament approved the request)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
On Amendment No 12
(Uproar)
On Amendment No 16
And there is no democracy here!
You are all buffoons!
So, for five minutes, let us calm down.
(Loud applause)
Skinner report (A5-0222/2000)
This was also untrue.
This is not one such area.
.
Hern√°ndez Mollar report (A5-0225/2000)
Pirker report (A5-0219/2000)

Wallis report (A5-0253/2000)
Glase report (A5-0220/2000)
Sadly, this is the situation.

We therefore abstained on this report.
However, three points are worth noting.
.
Resolution on racism (B5-0766/2000)
I am not sure which is worse.
And why is that?
That concludes the vote.
Adjournment of the session

Resumption of the session
Statements by the President

President.
Referral back to committee
(Parliament approved the request)
Agenda
Thank you, Mr Dell' Alba.
Thank you, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo.
Mr Varela' s request is out of place.
I can see that this is the case.
This is the case for Algeria.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I have not received any such letter.
This is not the first time.
Madam President, on a point of order.
That seizure was an illegal act.
They killed people.
They fired on prisoners.
In the meantime, I agree with him.
It is a matter of public record.
Credit institutions
These are Articles 20(1)(h) and 20(2).
It is vital to do that.
It is a very good report.
The debate is closed.
Our rapporteur also referred to this.
The causes are obvious.
It should be anything but that.
I am with him on that one.
I, too, would like to see this happen.
I would like to underline this point.
The Commission receives many requests.
I am very grateful to him for that.
The debate is closed.
Quality evaluation in school education
I am interested to hear your reaction.

There is more to it than that.
That is why I welcome this report.
Networking is so important.
Thank you very much, Mrs Reding.
The debate is closed.
World cultural and natural heritage
They have outstanding universal value.
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
1997 discharge
I will give you a few examples.
The more transparency, the better.
They were clearly set out last year.
European aid must serve peace.
Commissioner, this is a matter for you.
I was there myself.
Surely this is a reasonable demand?

Who will qualify for the scheme?
It is a voluntary scheme.
Naturally, there is a need for action.
The scenarios can vary a great deal.
So various areas come to mind.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
, deputising for the rapporteur.
These were the main concerns expressed.
So we look forward to its completion.
All credit to the Commission for this.
That concludes my comments.

This is not desirable in our eyes.
Could something be done about this?
BSE is only the tip of the iceberg.
We need more transparency and openness.
(The President cut the speaker off)
What is ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
It has done such outstanding work.
This relationship is indeed complex.
That is a court case that is ongoing.
We are simply doing our job.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 12 noon.
Financial assistance to SMEs (1999)
However, the Commission did not reply.
We do not understand!"
This is just too much micromanagement.
It is already history.
We are experiencing this with BSE.
This has, until now, not been the case.
Urgent action is called for here.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 12 noon.
Frontier workers
Why?
That is shocking.
The list goes on.
I would like to mention two.
The debate is suspended until 3 p.m.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I hope everybody has heard that.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Mr President, on a point of order.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
VOTE
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
This is unacceptable.

De Veyrac report (A5-0382/2000)
That is why I voted in favour.
.
That is unacceptable.


Doorn report (A5-0351/2000)
Thank you Mr Fatuzzo.
van der Laan report (A5-0397/2000)
We must be firm on this issue.
.
Garriga Polledo report (A5-0331/2000)

Finally, my comments on tax.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Environment directives
What can be done about this?
We can but hope.
So what solutions do we have?
What can Parliamentarians do?
They name and shame.
They call for fines.
It was poor legislation.
But what do we see happening?
Two camps are forming.
Nature simply will not allow it.
We are being accused unfairly here.
We could do more on that.
I agree with that.
We have to draw on that.
We have started activities like this.
The debate is closed.
Young farmers in the Union
We are living in a computer age.
This trend must be reversed.
Many thanks indeed go to him, then.


How can we help them?
This has been disastrous for farming.
This requires motivated producers.
We have set standards.
It was the parish plan.
We should not forget that.
Young farmers have computers.
That is the way forward for the future.
Mr President, I welcome this report.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Part I
Question No 25 by (H-0962/00)
But what is the problem, Commissioner?
That is urgency is most vital.
Question No 26 by (H-0975/00):
Question No 27 by (H-0969/00):
Question No 28 by (H-0977/00)
That is point one.

We cannot simply extend the quotas.
Question No 29 by (H-0003/01)

Question No 31 by (H-0973/00):
Question No 32 by (H-1002/00):
Where is it to be found?
Question No 33 by (H-0001/01):
That cannot be done.
I wish I could answer that question.
Questions to Mrs de Palacio
Question No 34 by (H-0955/00):
It certainly is not.

Question No 35 by (H-0960/00):
Question No 36 by (H-0963/00):
Questions to Mr Nielson
Let this be quite clear.
I share your concern.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I have two other points.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I want an answer to my question.
You passed over my Question 39.
I am here to take the question.
I am entitled to that.
There is an order of questions.
Your question is No 39.
Question No 40 by (H-0959/00):
This is normal procedure.
But here I am on clear ground.
Question No 41 by (H-0971/00):
The situation is alarming.
They are not all of the same character.
Question No 43 by (H-0984/00):
That is not so easy.
Common fisheries policy
Thank you very much.
Mr Nogueira Rom√°n may take the floor.
I think it is entirely appropriate.
Mr Cunha has the floor.
We must understand this.
Thank you, Mr Cunha.
So, Mr Fischler, the floor is yours.
Thank you, Commissioner.
First, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna.
This, of course, is to be welcomed.
That is the guiding principle.


We have opted to repeat ourselves.
Why was this the case?

But I am not one to blame you.
Things cannot go on like this.
I doubt it very much.
This can only be good for debate.
We really have done our utmost here.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Bangladesh
The next item is the joint debate on:
The military presence has not let up.
So this is all very good
This is quite remarkable.
We must encourage them to do so.
The joint debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)
This is the question we have to answer.
So much then, for information.
We must not shy away from it.
(Applause and protests)
That is what we tried to do.
And I should like to remind you...
We must not forget our starting point.
Thank you for your attention.
(Applause and protests)
You must give a reply here.
Our watchword must be "openness".
What then are the facts?
I think that is worth pointing out.
It is too early to say.
(Applause)
(Applause)
You conceded very little.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(Applause from the right)
That is not our subject today.
We have a different subject to discuss.
(Applause)
Do you take us for fools?

That is not making anybody complicit.
I have nothing else to say.
Thank you very much, Mrs Eriksson.
Mr President, on a point of order.
The debate is closed.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Rapid reaction facility
So we have an effective veto.
So far, so good.
For this we are very grateful to them.
Where is the European Union not active?
This will widen the scope.
This is a separate issue.
But how, and in what cases?
What kind of coordination?
N. Korea
Dialogue is the way forward.
Thank you, Minister.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
I propose adjourning the sitting.
We shall resume at noon for the voting.

Resolution on Korea

He seems not to have a sense of humour.
To some extent that is inevitable.
Lord Bethell spoke about Chechnya.
I could go on and on.
Allow me to comment on a few of them.
The debate is closed.
Programme of the Swedish Presidency
This is not acceptable.
We must see an end to this method.
(Applause)
We have four years to get to work.
Secondly, what method should we adopt?
(Applause)
The treaties must be simplified.
It is now or never.
May I welcome you to the club.
Such discrimination is not acceptable.
This policy must be reconsidered.
The second priority concerns jobs.
But what has happened since?
These proposals must be stopped.
Europe is being closed.
Empathy is the key word.
Finally, enlargement.
What would your answer be to that?
You will have to deal with it.
It was the same for the euro.
It certainly saddens me.

I hope that this will be the case.
There are different expressions.
Together, not individually.
You are all very welcome.
Clearly today it has been Sweden's day.
What happened?
I want to address a second point.
How are the markets to understand it?
The debate is closed.

I am very sorry.
Subject: Burma
Subject: ASEAN and Burma
That is my first question.
Question No 13 by (H-0985/00):
Civil aviation
.
But they have not reached agreement.
These issues must be settled.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Priorities in road safety
, rapporteur.
But how can that be?
This should be a cause for panic.
My country is a sad example of this.
A year on there is no directive.
What we have in February is a hearing.
More talk.
No action.
Let us see some action.
We must tackle that particular problem.
It is quite clear that we need action.

The signal we send out must be clear.
Either a standard is safe or it is not.
I have a problem with this.
We must now be bold.
Talk to your countries.
Where do the accidents happen?
That is what road safety needs.
What does this mean?
The same applies to drinking.
Something has to be done about this.
We must seek to make our roads safer.
I see this as a most important aspect.
But beware, let us make no mistake.
The first is drink-driving.
The date is purely coincidental.
It was in the communication in March.
I am sorry.
I do not know.
Why do we have to force them to do so?
I cannot accept that criticism.
Mr President, my name was mentioned.
Mr President, on a point of order.
The debate is closed.
We are being forced into it.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
How can we do this?
.
That is the first issue.
We never received that report.
Is it the end of the world?
No, it is just rush-hour in my region.
That is our challenge.
I have a problem with this.
All studies have clearly shown this.
This was obvious last September.
We cannot ignore that fact.
Thank you very much, Mrs de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
She was quite definitely there.
That will certainly be done, Mr Staes.
(Parliament adopted the Minutes)
It says nothing about Strasbourg.
This was a cause for great concern.
They really do enhance a man' s world.
We clearly have a problem, therefore.
How can discrimination be positive?
This is unacceptable in a democracy.
So what can be done?
How can we help women?
I have quoted one example.
I am in favour of a quota system.
I am an advocate of the system.
I support the Karamanou report.
Congratulations.
We must change this situation.
That much we all agree upon.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon.
Wood is a renewable natural resource.
Can I sound one note of warning.
Forests create peace.
That is what we all want to do.
That is my last point.
This is most justified.
We have lost 210 staff in all.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mr Swoboda, I agree entirely with you.
This is the issue being raised again.
That is not acceptable.
VOTE
Hedkvist Petersen Report (A5-0381/2000)
This is an intolerable situation.

Every person killed is one too many.
Poli Bortone Report (A5-0358/2000)
That is why I voted for this report.
Costa Paolo Report (A5-0345/2000)
What planet do we think we are on?
But what funding must be sought?
Karamanou Report (A5-0373/2000)
I have abstained, and this is why.
That is why I am not so keen on quotas.

Sepp√§nen Report (A5-0384/2000)
That, however, is not justified.
Read the agenda.
We cannot vote on this point now.
You cannot do so now.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
How neutral can those judges be?
What followed was to shock the world.
This concern is well-founded.
No one cared about Cambodia.
The joint debate is closed.
So these are truly dramatic events.
But we are still there.
Let me turn to Georgia.
I say this as a European.
It deserves our support.
The joint debate is closed.
Human rights
Situation in Turkish prisons
(Verts/ALE).
It is up to the government to act.
It is not easy.
I remember the scenes on the BBC.
That is our main demand.
But unfortunately we cannot.
Why?
Situation in Algeria
In this context, one question arises.
Torture is still the order of the day.
People still go unpunished.
The violence has got to stop.
For we cannot keep quiet any longer.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
International Criminal Court
Thank you, Mr Posselt.
Nothing escapes you!
Thank you for pointing that out.
Those objectives have been achieved.
Words are not enough.
The time for action is now.
Earlier we spoke about Cambodia.
We are debating the former Yugoslavia.
It needs our support.
This is scandalous.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Earthquake in El Salvador
This is a great joy.
I can only agree with the criticism.
This is pathetic.
But this is bad enough.
It left yesterday.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Long-stay visa
Therefore, I can take 20 minutes.
Imagine that!
(Applause)
This is where the difficulty lies.
This is a guarantee.
I welcome Mr Deprez's report.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
VOTE (continuation)
That is why I shall vote in its favour.
Adjournment of the session
That concludes the agenda.
(The sitting was closed at 6.15 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Announcements by the President
Thank you, Mr Dupuis.
(Applause from the centre and left)
I call on Mr Newton Dunn to resign.
Thank you, Mrs Frahm.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Economic and social cohesion
The second issue is enlargement.
There has been progress.
How can we address these issues?
Why?
It is not enough just to send cheques.
The debate is only just beginning.
I see that figure as a reference point.
It would not, therefore, be fair.
That is all I can say for the present.

I am here to listen to your views.
Where do you stand on this?
Mrs Schroedter, we do need time.
We are only launching the debate.
This is a truthful report.
My question is quite simple.
That is my first point.
My second point is solidarity.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes this item.
Mediterranean region
The next item is the joint debate on:
This is what we expect.
More is requested and then is not used.
The same applies to human rights.
Unfortunately, this is true.
Why am I telling you all this?
We need to get a few things straight.
I have a question for the Council.
This is disappointing management.
I welcome this debate.
It has been an extremely good debate.
This was clearly not the right moment.
I fully agree with these.
I hope Parliament will understand.
That is what we are trying to do.
This is not a virtual policy.
Situation in the Middle East
Progress has been made in all areas.
Thank you very much, Mr Sakellariou.
It had become desert land.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is what they fear.
But who fears, exactly?
For heaven's sake!
What sort of Europe is this?
Why is this?
That is my first question.
We agree.
I am still reeling from the shock.
Fortunately no one was injured.
People of Europe have no idea of this.
This is completely unacceptable.
Why do I say this?
Partly in response to Mr Morillon.
Why do I say this?
This is an historic step forward.
And that was my hope.
The debate is closed.
Plan Colombia
What type of programmes are they?
The inequality is shocking.
How is it going to do this?
Responsibility for what?
Millions of deaths?
Can we accept Plan Colombia?
Mr Salafranca says there is confusion.
There is no confusion.
It just exacerbates the situation.
How many resolutions have we adopted?
That too is our mission.
We have our own plan.
What we are doing forms no part of it.
We are not suggesting that.
The debate is closed.
Rail transport
They will be entitled to do so.
We could have been bolder.
Secondly, regarding the cost structure.
Two things are most important.
Here, too, the treatment is unfair.
This investment is necessary.

We must reverse that trend.
(The President cut the speaker off)
No remedial action was taken.
This is not merely a domestic issue.
The problem is that it does not work.
Let us be clear about this.
This kind of thing is always happening.
Thank you very much, Mr Patten.
The debate is closed.
Energy efficiency labelling
We are all agreed on this matter.
Please take this into account.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
There are essentially three reasons.
Has he undertaken further training?
This brings me to my third reason.
Briefly, three more basic principles.
Secondly, lifelong learning.
We can be slightly proud of that.
There is something wrong there.
We must put it right quickly.
The debate is closed.
I thank Mr Ferri for his work.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.35 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Decision on urgent procedure
Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries.
A ban on mechanically recovered meat.
That is still dogging us.
(Applause)
Mr Byrne intimated as much.
What is the matter with them?
And there is an end to it.
It is a fact of life.
What else do we need to do?
That is out of the question.
No other method should be allowed now.
Exactly which Member State is BSE-free?
And may I ask: how do they know?
We too want to do likewise.
We must no longer blame anyone else.
Under pressure from which lobby?
So what are we going to do now?
We are to burn it.
The Commission does not act, it reacts.
We are helping the wrong people.
This is what they rightly expect of us.
Let me give an example.
Mr President, BSE is still a danger.
The danger has not been averted.
Unfortunately it was closed too late.
Is it sterilised enough at 133 degrees?
The second problem is the brain.
We can also use pigs' brains.
The third aspect is testing.
What are we going to do?
We want more credible answers.
So I welcome the ban.
But is it really necessary?
This position is illogical.
There is no doubt about that.
They must be destroyed.
(Applause from the right)
I can assure you of that.
It merely constitutes a beginning.
That is not the issue.
It is about food safety.
What is being done?
That is just not on.
Mr President, I will be very brief.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The Commissioner has the floor.
Why is that the case?
The question is how and where.
We cannot do that.
Animals have to have fat in their diet.
That undermines consumer confidence.
They are found in fat.
It is perfect for the calves.
There are six of these.
As Mr Olsson said, it is unethical.
The substance is carcinogenic.
How can that be justified?
I emphatically reject that proposition.
It is a scientific issue.
I have been through this before.
This is not acceptable.
Thank you, Mr Olsson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
New frontiers in book production
What then is the report about?
This is why this report is excellent.
A second point is market forces.
These are the good points.
Let us not fool ourselves.
Let me give you some examples.
Thank you, Mrs Reding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place very shortly.

Agenda
This is a bad precedent.
Thank you, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo.
Relating to Thursday:
President.
Secondly, there is a political reason.
I have some information for Mr Cox.
(Parliament rejected the request)
That is completely untrue.
We will give you the information.
And there is another thing.
It is a false start.
Thank you very much.
Three months have passed since then.
Perhaps you could do something for me.
Please join me in welcoming Mr Patakis.
There are 30 people sitting up here.
, deputising for the rapporteur.
The debate is closed.
That is not legally possible.
Anyway, work is being done on this.
So we must do something about it.
My group has two observations to make.
I think that is a good thing.
I think that is also a good thing.
We must invest in it.
That means 780 deaths.
The debate is closed.
Procedures must indeed be simplified.
I truly hope that you do manage it.
Our group will support you.
Thank you very much, Mr Patakis.
There was proper consultation.
Part three is still to come.
A specified language must be spoken.
Which language are we going to speak?
That is positive.
That will take somewhat longer.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Recovery of cod stocks in the Irish Sea
It is very short.
When will we learn that lesson?
There is still a great deal to do.
I thank the rapporteur in his absence.
That is how exhausted the sea is.
That just leaves the Commission.
This is not an easy problem.
It is a very serious problem.
This is what I want to concentrate on.
A problem exists.
This is an old story.
And thank you for being so brief.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.30 p.m.)
Thank you, Mr President.
Vote on a request for urgent procedure
Commission work programme for 2001/Nice
I will not dwell on the last 12 months.
(Loud, sustained applause)
It is absolutely unacceptable.
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
We should like to be more specific.
If we work together, it will succeed.
(Applause)
We are all in this together.
But I have looked at it.
We have to move away from this.
We do not find the answers in here.
I would like to see them.
Is it yours?
(Applause)
Population growth was mentioned here.
Why not?
We put forward proposals.
In short, Nice means less democracy.
It must also be broadened.
I admit that one hundred per cent.
(Applause)
I take a different view.
That too is a slippery slope.
The Commission submits proposals.
It has the right of initiative.
I admit that.
(Applause)
That brings me to the third point.
My third point relates to the subjects.
Post-Nice is not what it is about.
That is the way it should be.
The promise is binding.
But how is that to be arranged?
When are they to obtain one?
But how?
Their failure in Nice is quite enough.
Its opponents do not reject the name.
They reject the convention itself.
Now comes the difficult part, however.
That is their job.
I would plead for a special procedure.
I would advocate that way forward.
It is not true.
Our view on the core issues is clear.
Mr Corbett quoted Chairman Mao.
We must also reschedule the next IGC.
There are important questions.
(Laughter and applause)
This will have to be rectified.
Ferber (PPE-DE).
President.
Thank you.
I am speaking now only of the model.
An interesting example has been given.
I have to say: we are not delaying it.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Industrial restructuring and mergers
That is quite logical.
We want to see that true partnership.
We have done that.
It would be helpful.
But we will withdraw our resolution.
We must make sure they are effective.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
VOTE
(Parliament adopted the resolution)

Nicholson report (A5-0042/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
And here's to the cod as well!
That concludes voting time.
This sort of news is commonplace now.
I will cite two examples.
The first is forecasting.
The third strand is specific policy.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
You must admit that it is surprising.
No one pretends that it is perfect.
It is important to emphasise that.
We have got that balance right.
That is a very important provision.
But it is not.
Is it not all a bit too soon?
Where is the right balance to be found?
This is no easy task.
Let us not be naive, Mr President.
Why am I defending this opinion?
Copying will also cost jobs.
The State loses out on income too.
They also employ 1.4 million people.
The lobby has already been mentioned.
They are getting something for nothing.
I say this sincerely.
I refer to what has already been said.
Firstly, Amendment No 2.
We have a clear timetable.
I welcome this.
We have brokered a good compromise.
We expressly welcome all this.
(The president cut the speaker off)
Instead, we must make use of science.
The debate is suspended.
Reform of the beef and veal market
What exactly is this plan?
Fast action is called for.
We therefore also need fast reform.
We have no alternative.
And yet none of this is enough.
Thank you for your attention.
Could you comment on that too?
As I, in fact, said.
I think you are quite right.
This system defies belief!
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is also a fact of life.
What is the Commission' s view on this?
That is news to me.
It makes the position clear.
I am very grateful for that.
Now for my second question.
How are you planning to resolve this?
This investigation is under way.
Why?
That concludes the debate.
Question Time (Commission)
Thank you very much, Mr Berenguer.
Part I
Question No 45 by (H-0014/01):
I thank the Commissioner for his reply.
Question No 46 by (H-0055/01):
What can I say?
And there you have it.
Question No 47 by (H-0037/01):
There have been hunger strikes.
Question No 48 by (H-0069/01):
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Your reply was most satisfactory.
I have a number of questions.
Question No 50 by (H-0057/01):
Question No 52 by (H-0122/01):
I am sure that will continue.
Well, that really takes the biscuit!
Thank you for your answer.
What I said was not ridiculous.
It is not in any way a secret.
That will take place in due course.
Question No 53 by (H-0083/01):
The selection board consisted of 8 men.
They are not over-ambitious targets.
Questions to Commissioner Byrne
Question No 54 by (H-0011/01):
Question No 55 by (H-0019/01):
And what is the reason for them?
Where is the harmonisation?
It is a Community-wide measure.
It applies to all Member States.
This was a justifiable response.
Question No 56 by (H-0021/01):
And this teacher is you, Commissioner.
Do you agree with this?
Is this not a contradiction?
Answer me please.
Some Member States do that.
What is the conclusion?
Moreover, remember BSE.
There is other legislation under way.
The debate is closed.
, rapporteur.
The first is its use as a market tool.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Food supplements
(Parliament rejected the motion)
I totally support this.
Many thanks, Mrs Corbey.
Firstly, the scope of the directive.
Lastly, a few words about labelling.
We welcome this contribution.
Claim and counter-claim, then.
Folic acid is an example.
Harmonisation is therefore necessary.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Two or three-wheel motor vehicles
I do not agree with that.
This is in line with Mr Lange' s views.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Vehicles with more than eight seats
He has done a good job on that.
The same arguments apply.
Regrettably that is not the case.
If it were, we would support it.
I had a look through these 150 pages.
It does not address school buses.
When is all this going to end?
Not a single word of explanation.
Do they do so on grounds of cost?
No.
No.
No.
They are wrong.
We must and we will.
We are fully in agreement with that.
So why are we rejecting this directive?
We wish to see mutual recognition.
We have come a long way since then.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The process is open.
Is the process too informal, then?
This could be a pilot project.
The potential is certainly there.
Back to the report, however.
This is a very good report.
I refer to just two aspects.
I strongly support women's rights.
I believe it was fine as it was.
The second point concerns the budget.
Last year's budget was EUR 50 million.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.20 a.m.)
Are there any comments?
It is our responsibility to use them.
We will look into this matter.
(The Minutes were approved)
Accession partnership with Turkey
Turkey will then have to act.
And indeed, we should not deny this.
It is a difficult issue.
What exactly is the situation?
We are neglecting this at the moment.
Obviously that will not suffice.
The door remained closed.
But I do not want to go into that here.
We do not think so.
Is this the case?
I think this is our problem.
We repudiate that kind of intolerance.
We do not need to go any further.
This must be stopped right now.
Mr President, I have a dream.
This would have two consequences.
Both are highly unlikely scenarios.
I say this without any ifs and buts.
Commission.
This brings me to my second point.
It simply has not.
Turkey is an important country.
That can and must not happen.
They have all been paid out.
Only SAPARD was paid out rather late.
I would like to say one last thing.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Lisbon
The next item is the joint debate on:
Lastly, education.
Public finances are strong.
Prices are stable.
Nor do we need any new processes.
Let me name a few.
This is in the interests of us all.
The resource Europe has is knowledge.
The Internet has been mentioned.
An example is water.
Water is a limited resource.
It is a difficult balancing act.
Biotechnology must also be stimulated.
Do not forget that.
Why is Ireland being criticised?
They provide a snapshot of reality.
But a soft landing does seem possible.
I hope they are as good as their word.
They are ready to renationalize.
No, clearly not.
I did not hear that mentioned recently.
We are on the right path.
Or are the responsibilities different?
Where do I think these priorities lie?
VOTE
I shall be abstaining.
I will be abstaining.

We therefore voted against this report.

This then really is a fool' s bargain.

Hence I will vote against the proposal.

I have a final comment to make.

Why?
The debate is closed.
Lisbon (continuation)
How do we measure this success?
One of 10 years will soon have passed.
Of course there are.
But why is this not highlighted?
My final point pertains to employment.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
Was that just an idle boast?
Few have taken up this aspect.
But paper is patient.
We do not need a literature Summit.
I shall try to make a few comments.
Free movement of persons
That is what is at issue.
So, do not shake your head!
I do not need a plea for this.
None whatsoever.

That is a big problem.
We know. We all do.
Do not ask me why.
Something must be done about this.
This is to be welcomed.
Examples of this are legion.
Who are the architects of this system?
This is also evident from the replies.
I believe that that is not right.
This is today' s topic of discussion.
I do hope so.
Quite the reverse in fact.
We believe this is extremely important.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
First Mr Alavanos has a point of order.
Question No 1 by (H-0015/01):
Question No 2 by (H-0022/01):
Mr Danielsson said nothing about this.
But what about the mandate?
Is a mandate needed?
We must have a clear answer to this.
That is my question.
It is not about the general principles.
And that is a scandal.
There is major support for this view.
Question No 3 by (H-0031/01):
Yes or no?
It is very easy to answer yes or no.
No now.
Yes possibly later.
Question No 4 by (H-0018/01):
I cannot verify it.
Question No 5 by (H-0023/01):
I will be brief.
This is unacceptable in my opinion.
Question No 6 by (H-0026/01):
Mr Bonde asks an important question.
However, Mr Schmidt need not worry.
Question No 7 by (H-0027/01):
We are working actively on this issue.
I was the rapporteur for that plan.
Mr Nogueira has the floor.
There will not be a debate on this.
Question No 8 by (H-0032/01):
Question No 9 by (H-0052/01):
(The President cut the speaker off)
Question No 10 by (H-0040/01):
Question No 11 by (H-0041/01):
Question No 12 by (H-0042/01):
Question No 13 by (H-0043/01):
Question No 14 by (H-0044/01):
Question No 15 by (H-0045/01):
Question No 16 by (H-0046/01):
Will we see a draft before Gothenburg.
Question No 17 by (H-0050/01):
Above all, improvements are required.
Question No 18 by (H-0054/01):
.
This is the universality principle.
I fully share their opinion.
So the system works.
The debate is closed.
The Union and Macao beyond 2000
The debate is closed.
We shall obviously be voting in favour.
Why can't the UK do the same I thought.
Mexico is an important country.
This, I believe, is a truism.
I will follow it closely.
I have two specific points to make.
This is quite significant.
It entered into force on 1 July 2000.
It is a new, very ambitious beginning.
The debate is closed.
Unfortunately, they are still dying.
That is why a correction was crucial.
We are not yet ready.
We support the French initiative.
This is an inhumane business.
I do not believe it is.
A distinction must be made.
Who is really responsible?
That means higher prices.
We are not treating the disease.
I would say not.
That is why we need these measures.
We must do more.
But we cannot do that overnight.
Why?
But what will the consequence be?
I really do not understand at all.

The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)
Research guidelines 2002 - 2006
Let us do away with techno-nationalism.
That is laid down in the Treaty.
That was successful too.

I think we must not be overcautious.
(Applause from the gallery)
The devil is not only in the detail.
All I can say is 'Have fun!'
It has become a political fact.
How should we define it?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.

Situation in Kosovo
I find this perfectly unacceptable.
All eyes are on Belgrade.
What is the task of the EU?
Why should we not play a part?
We are good mediators.
There is no-one from the press.
It is both paradoxical and frivolous.
But now to the topic itself.
This is a real scandal.
It must be different in the Balkans.

The Tibetans are persecuted.
Tashi delek!
Torture is on the increase.
Freedom of expression is limited.
Mosques are burned down.
That is completely unacceptable.
Laos
We now wish to see an improvement.
They must be able to contribute freely.
Guinea-Conakry
But, all this is not enough.
The situation is critical.
We can help to achieve this.
At first, that did not apply to Guinea.
There is a great deal at stake.
Nigeria
Freedom of expression in Pakistan
It must be abolished.
You raised the problem of refugees.

Stability plans in Ireland and France
Ireland achieves surpluses.
Just imagine a different situation.
(The President cut the speaker off)
In 2001, that figure has risen to 5.4%.
That is something we can discuss.
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
This latest episode does not help.
Ireland' s economy is prospering.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Our debt/ GDP ratio is only 39%.
It is now 10 years later IEP80 billion.
Today we have a budget surplus.
Today we have 1.67 million.
I have no pat answer to this question.
This imbalance has been upset.
I do not think that would be possible.
This is certainly the current scenario.
Can we really not trust the Irish?
Not at all.
We must not let this happen.
That was important.
He was told it by the central banks.
Two wrongs do not make a right.
Just look, they say.
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
The debate is closed.
The situation was the same last month.

Statement by the President
Agenda
The agenda is thus adopted.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
I await your explanation.
Mr Prodi will perhaps clarify matters.
(Applause and laughter)
Mr Bar√≥n Crespo, how delightful!
Thank you, Mrs Karamanou.
I think this is a reasonable decision.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Commission reform: human resources


I thank them and I pay tribute to them.
We will fulfil that commitment.
That hope has been fully realised.
I hope our partnership will continue.
That is understood amongst the staff.
I have encountered no sour attitudes.
I should like to address two problems.
They need clear guidance.
What plans do you have in this respect?
That has changed somewhat.
They are not.
(Protests from Mr Bigliardo)
I regret that.
In Strasbourg, Mr Howitt!
This is an unbearable situation.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is also a possible solution!
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
I had two points.
The second point concerns Moldavia.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is not a point of order!
I congratulate you.

Draft SAB 1/2001
And that really is not an easy task.
We have to break away from this system.
He killed people, not animals.
Let us not forget that.
That will not enhance our credibility.
We must put an end to this situation.
But this cannot be achieved overnight.
That is simply not feasible.
Let me make this very clear.
There is no more after this.
Is that sensible?
In the view of my group it is not.
We need a change of policy course.
We cannot, however, leave it at that.
But then what will we do?
There are sufficient funds for that.
Please, let us keep to this.
I cannot let that pass.
That was Mrs Schreyer's proposal.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Europe is guilty.
Europe must make amends.
In any event, we will see.
We cannot ignore this fact.
That is quite correct.
Today, our house is on fire.
That is not all, however.
That is not the problem that we face.
You have our full support.
Above all, it is necessary.
We must do this in a calm way.
It is not as simple as that.
It is important to make this clear.
Thank you very much, Mr Mulder.
The debate is closed.
Foot-and-mouth disease
The next item is Question Time.
Are you well prepared?
I also echo Mr Adam' s feelings.
There is also EU legislation.
Mr Sturdy then asked me two questions.
The answer to that question is no.
That is my first question.
Your views on this please.
Mr President, I have three questions.
Can you say anything about this?
Is that true?
Movements have been restricted.
You say that it has to be licensed.
All this needs to be tightened up.
He referred to intensive farming.
That concludes this item.
Electronic communications

Lastly, environmental impact.
I refer to Amendment No 78.
To return to the reports.
That is the priority.
Finally, Mrs Niebler' s report.
So where does this take us?
And that means fair access.
This communication must be free.
No, we cannot.
They have weakened democracy.
Our group supports this.
I want to try and avoid that.
I concur.
What are we actually about here?
Second point: NRAs.
They cannot have their cake and eat it.
I just leave that as a question mark.
It is a small change.
These are not just any reports.
This regime has worked well.
We know the facts.
The single market is fragmented.
The debate is closed.
This concept raises legal problems.
What is the purpose of this initiative?
I therefore appeal to the rapporteur.
The previous speaker made this point.
I shall mention a few.
A second point.
It sounds very limited.
A third point.
Does such a thing exist?
A higher status, or a lower one?
And I could go on.
We therefore welcome these two points.
This is a matter of equality.
The debate is closed.
Development policy
Trade is the key.
I applaud much of its thinking.
Mr Gemelli' s report is good.
It is a question of effectiveness.
I oppose that.
I could go on asking questions.
Then there is health policy.
The test is implementation.
I thank him for that.
How can this be?
What are the reasons for this?
I have seen no sign of this.
Luxembourg has just made it above 0.7%.
So it is fine that we have the G7.
This is in any case a complex issue.
The Member States have now decided.
But we have become mainstream.
This is where we are now.
We never had that before.
Highly migratory fish stocks
I only have two points I want to make.
After all the stocks need our help.
The joint debate is closed.
The protocol concerns tuna only.
Of course, this is nothing new.
Anything less is shameful.
We need a reply.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
Thank you, Mr Wuermeling.
Air strikes in Iraq
(Applause from the PPE Group)
Morally speaking, they are intolerable.
We have to keep looking.
I visited Iran.
Let us not forget those people either.
I have been to Kurdistan.
And why?
This man is a monster.
This man is indeed a modern Hitler.
He is still there.
What did they know about sanctions?
And who had the last laugh?
Saddam Hussein, of course!
These are difficult issues.
They are important.
Hospitals can no longer provide care.
Schools can no longer remain open.
Most of the population is illiterate.
Finding food is an achievement.
Access to information is controlled.
Let us move in this direction.
I am sure that we all agree.
The problem is how to do it.

It is disgraceful.
It is quite disgraceful.
The debate is closed.
Association agreements
Why should it make such a request?
For us, he is just across the Atlantic.
The negotiations are well on track.
It was a considerable success.
Negotiating texts have been exchanged.
I agree with this opinion.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
VOTE
On Amendment No 1
Haug (PSE), rapporteur.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Thank you very much.

Haug report (A5-0064/2001)
We voted against this paragraph.
It is not on their agenda.
That time is not now.
We do not.
Brunetta report (A5-0061/2001)
Why did I vote for it?
Paasilinna report (A5-0053/2001)

Niebler report (A5-0062/2001)
I therefore voted against Amendment 21.
Why does she envy him?
Maybe some generous soul, but very few.
Pi√©trasanta report (A5-0051/2001)
Gallagher report (A5-0044/2001)
It is still about tuna.
Avil√©s Perea report (A5-0058/2001)
That was not the case with this report.
Gemelli report (A5-0059/2001)

Marset Campos report (A5-0049/2001)
Adjournment of the session

Resumption of the session
Tribute
They both passed away on 3 March 2001.
Statement by the President
Are there any comments?
This will be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
Thank you, Mr De Rossa.
We export 90% of our entire production.
Thank you, Mr Hyland.
I cannot take this step, however.
There is one problem, however.
I entirely agree with Mr Swoboda.
It is therefore a matter of urgency.
There was no vote for a resolution.
(The House gave its assent)
We have to stop live exports.
The next requirement is for the truth.
(The House rejected the request)
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
Relating to Thursday: President.
(Parliament gave its assent)
The order of business is thus agreed.
Speeches relating to points of order
That is an awful lot of months!
Thank you, Mr Schulz.
There are several precedents.
It is very simple.
It is a legal, not a political issue.
Madam President, on a point of order.
Six of the 16 crew lost their lives.
That is a very sad reality.
Thank you, Mrs Morgantini.
Safe transport of radioactive material
No one can possibly object to that.
We broadly support this view.
This industry is never complacent.
It is tendentious and ill-informed.
The sooner we realise that the better.
What a paradox!
I urge everyone to keep to the facts.
This is not what the report is about.
The debate is closed.
WTO negotiations on the built-in agenda
Let me pick out a few points.
But never mind!
Now, two observations.
That is a unilateral objective.
That is not enough.
There are many other questions as well.
This is of deep concern.
There are countless examples of this.
That is my first question.
What is the Commission planning to do?
The WTO is what it is.
That is the stage we are at today.
That is part of our agenda.
Thank you, Commissioner Lamy.
The debate is closed.
COM in the sugar sector
I do not think so.
That is not a blank cheque, however.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
Talk about competition!
Please do not try to mend this system.
And why until 2003?
The debate is closed.
Information and communication
Fourthly, what are the pillars?
That is the problem.
This is a dreadful state of affairs.
It is like a poor orphan.
They do exist.
You said it yourself.
We have produced it in three months.
I doubt it.
Who are they?
We do not know them.
We would like to know who they are.
Today you have stood in for us.
There is no clear strategy.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Shipbuilding
This line no longer exists.
I do not wish to be misunderstood.
This must be done now.
Why?
It has been discontinued.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m.)
Opening of the Session
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Decision on urgent procedure
Agenda
We discussed this yesterday.
That is clear.
Carriers' liability
That would be draconian and excessive.
What would we do in the same situation?
Whom do we want them to pay?
Those who remain will be the Mafia.
That is our own responsibility.
I say that with deep regret.
This is good.
Absolutely all of them know it.
I think we should bear this in mind.
I shall be supporting Amendment No 12.
Vote against the Kirkhope report!
This is acknowledged even by the UNHCR.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
That is the good news.
This is our second serious objection.
All these are to be welcomed.
It was solidarity with ourselves.
That is how matters stand, however.

Is this only the case for Europeans?
I sincerely believe not.
I believe so.
They should not be mutually exclusive.
We have not heard the last of this.
Of course we share our responsibility.
We have to.
I am a teacher by profession.
So you know what I am talking about.
Thank you Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
by Mr Deprez (A5-0066/2001),
and
No to these three initiatives.
Exactly what happened, we do not know.
On the contrary.
This is what causes mass immigration.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
European crime prevention network
Welcome
We welcome this.
We are against this.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
VOTE
The rapporteur has asked for the floor.
The rapporteur is opposed to this.
(Parliament rejected Amendment No 33)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
This is not a sustainable solution.
.
The momentum for reform is mounting.
.
Kirkhope Report (A5-0069/2001)
I welcome it.
I therefore rejected them.
.
.
Wiebenga Report (A5-007/2001)
You are late, very late!"
Deprez report (A5-0066/2001)
Why is this?
Hatzidakis Report (A5-0040/2001)
These goods are highly dangerous" .
Schwaiger Report (A5-0076/2001)
Bon app√©tit!
.
.
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.

.
Thank you, Mrs Reding.
.
.
.
And nothing has changed since then.
So, I hope this is perfectly clear.
I have a question regarding the latter.
Is anything known about this yet?
.
.
Everyone understands this.
.
So what will the next the stage be?
.
I know FIFA has recommended it.
.
There was a demand for this system.
I certainly hope that this is the case.
You are quite right, Mrs Matikainen.
That is not what we want.
Thank you, Mrs Reding.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Fight against fraud
We need another great leap forward.
Independence is a great good.
Allow me to comment on the sore points.
It is a difficult matter.
The Commission knows what it is.
This will not do.
We must do our best to protect it.
This question is certainly still open.
I hope that will happen in April.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Part I
Question No 47 by (H-0191/01):
That is the procedure.
Question No 48 by (H-0193/01):
Question No 49 by (H-0137/01):
I am talking about the next one.
Question No 50 by (H-0149/01):
The Commission shares his concerns.
I fully share much of what she says.
This is what I have just explained.
Question No 52 by (H-0134/01):
What is going to happen?
Are both sides equally to blame?
I am not aware of any such plans.
You asked what happens next.
Question No 53 by (H-0220/01):
What do I find conceivable?
Our talks are still in their infancy.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Question No 55 by (H-0188/01):
.
One Member State has already done so.
I just want to thank her for that.
Question No 56 by (H-0219/01):
Question No 57 by (H-0239/01):
Not one was excluded.
We need a preventive strategy.
Question No 59 by (H-0132/01):
Certainly not.
This is a very important point.
No doubt there have been delays.
This is the reality.
Question No 60 by (H-0142/01):
Question No 61 by (H-0144/01):
Thank you, Commissioner Barnier.
That plan did not work.
All credit to the Spanish.



I am sorry.

Is that so?
The approach is right.
We should continue along this path.
We are very mindful of that.
That is when it all started.
We have a long way to go yet.
That is what this directive is about.
We are on the right road.
This is contained in Amendment No 36.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Traffic is a real challenge.
That seems highly ambitious to us.
The list could extend much further.
It will go no further, it says.
It is nothing personal.
What about the Greeks?
Mrs M√ºller has addressed this problem.
Does subsidiarity apply here or not?
We must solve these problems.
That is perhaps important information.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Environmental inspections
It did not.
We will put pressure on Member States.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Motor vehicle heating systems
This is not a job for Parliament.
This is an important directive.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Energy efficiency
All are helped by energy efficiency.
Please bring it forward again.
We can look at energy appliances.
We all agree that it is a good thing.
Why?
On that we are in complete agreement.
Human behaviour is essential.
We must not squander it.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Thank you very much.
(The sitting was closed at 11.14 p.m.)
Thank you, Mrs Stihler.
Thank you, Mr Watson.
Fine, thank you, Mrs Banotti.
Follow-up to Nice

What do we want to do together?
What will our plan be?
Do we want more integration or not?
What will its mandate be?
And we ourselves are working on this.
(Applause)
You have launched a website.
This debate must yield results.
I join you in that.
We need a different method.

Of course we do.
How must this be done?
A new method is vital.
Subsidiarity is a two-ended concept.
Mr President, I have two things to say.
My second point concerns content.
It is actively anti-democratic.
This method would be very dangerous.
This would spell disaster for Europe.
So let us look at the future debate.
First, its nature.
Secondly, the breadth.
You were not talking about democracy.
Brok (PPE-DE).
(Applause)
Thank you.
I will give an example.
I agree with you wholeheartedly there.
But actions speak louder than words.
One last word on the timetable.
We can wrap this up by the end of 2003.
What needs to be done?
Let us not beat about the bush.
Let us take note of this.
One last word, Mr President.
Some answers please.
But how do they fit in with the facts?
You were in Nice.
What is it you really want?
What is it you stand for?
Where exactly are you reacting?
Where do we stand with the Council?
What is wrong with Sweden?
I am relying on your ambition.

And that is what counts.
It was opened barely a week ago.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Wish that I could do likewise.
This is in our common interest.
Secondly: the GALILEO programme.
Firstly: intergenerational equity.
Secondly: the distribution of work.
Fourthly and lastly: immigration.
This process must be enhanced.
Not at all; just the opposite, in fact!
We can do better in many areas.
Any new technology is just a tool.
We are not satisfied.
At that time I was very surprised.
The social profile is very weak.
This is good.
These are two different things.
This presents us with two challenges.
So how will that work?
Swedish universities are in crisis.
What happened?
Not a thing!
Thank you, Mr Jarzembowski.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Signed: Jo√£o Correa' .
How can this happen?
VOTE
Before the vote:
After the vote on Amendment No 13:
Before the vote:
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
On Amendment No 16
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
'Who' s that?'
I replied.
'It' s me, don' t you recognise me?'
'Me who?'
'Me, Carlo Fatuzzo!
I' m Mr Fatuzzo the man.'

Korhola report (A5-0074/2001)
Disclosure could cost them money.
Angelilli report (A5-0070/2001)

President.
B√∂sch report (A5-0078/2001)
.
Wijkman report (A5-0054/2001)
Social policy is a productive factor.
And why, colleagues, is that?
But what did she mention?
I think there is food for thought here.
Nothing less than that.
That was a year ago.
Are we any closer to the plans?
That is a very serious issue.
I cannot understand this.
The debate is closed.
All three concepts are interconnected.
Hence the high ranking.

These are closely linked.
The UN is our most important partner.
He has raised an important debate.
Let me be clear.
I very much hope that it will hold.
This is, I think, an important point.
Finally, of course, accountability.
The Kosovo crisis showed us that.
The EU has this potential.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Our support cannot therefore be total.
This is the situation in Macedonia.
However, I cannot hide my true concern.
We are looking forward to April.
It is that simple.
More must be done to protect children.
What lessons has it learned?
Has it been of use to you?
Nor did the Council.
Has the Council buried it?
We should all denounce it vigorously.
It is extremely important.
I hope we can in future.
The debate is closed.
That goes without saying.
I cannot agree with that.
Foot-and-mouth disease
It is immensely infectious and deadly.
There is no consumer risk.
We need more details from Argentina.
This does not happen in Europe.
We must know how much it will cost.
Let us stop mixing up the issues.
But it is not worthwhile commercially.
Yes, you are slaughtering animals.
It is not enough!
A stop must be put to this system.
Allow me to make three observations.
Where will the money come from?
A third and final observation.
The third error is that of immigration.
And if so, how?
Many considerations arise.
Mrs Doyle said that it was a crisis.
Could I also ask what the EU is doing?
This is an important issue.
We must not lose sight of that.
The other route is the better one.
There farming is at its most intensive.
I must stress this.
The legislation is there.
Controls and enforcement are important.
We must not lose sight of that.
You have stood by your word.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 2 by (H-0141/01):
Mr President, I had the first question.
I hope that it does not happen again.
Question No 3 by (H-0229/01):
The Council's role is more complicated.
So a great deal is being done.
We are in complete agreement on this.
This is my counsel to the Council.
Question No 4 by (H-0145/01):
I think that I have been quite clear.
Question No 5 by (H-0147/01):
Question No 6 by (H-0156/01):
It is easier in certain areas.
Question No 7 by (H-0150/01):
Question No 8 by (H-0152/01):
What do you think?
Was the Commission' s reply wrong?
Perhaps you can advise me.
Question No 10 by (H-0159/01):
As I have explained, they would.
So I cannot comment on that.
That makes it more difficult.
That is a purpose I share.
There is no difference of opinion.
She want speedier legislation.
She is right.
That is the second point.
The Commission knows that.
That is the third point.
I cannot speak for the Council.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
European economy
So much for the pros.
We also have a few demands.
But that is by the by.
The von Wogau report must be rejected.
Why?
Allow me to make three observations.
Here too, we lack initiatives.
This is patently a key point.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Unfortunately it was not.
It also renders cooperation difficult.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
EU election assistance and observation
In what way?
Sustainability is important too.
Common strategy on Ukraine
Ukraine is split internally.
Privatisation goes ahead slowly.
That is the good news.
That is the bad news.

Our group supports its main premises.
It has yet to ratify its accession.
Ukraine was not one of them.
What sort of concept do I mean?
This is a good report.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
We welcome that.
I was part of that troika delegation.
The point he makes is entirely valid.
I rather sympathise with his view.
The debate is closed.
It gets to the heart of the matter.
But we should not do that.
This is a peculiar combination!
It is a strange game!
But we need something more.
We need to work more quickly.
What does that word evoke?
Thank you all once again!
Work of ACP/EU Assembly (2000)
I have prepared this report twice.
We are now a parliamentary assembly.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)
Life assurance
(Loud applause)
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken today at noon.
Water management
However, there are alternatives!
Israel provides a good example of this.
Everyone would gain from that.
Producers would find new markets.
Would you like an example?
Let us do so.
We must stop that before it happens.
It is something we surely do not want.
The debate is closed.
Biotechnology industry
There is room for improvement there.
But it is not all about growth.
We call it Bio-Science-North.
I think it is a good report.
Such things exist.
We could imitate it.
That is Cuba.
We live in a democracy.
What have we seen in that time?
It is a question of distribution.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Balanced regulation is important.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Mr Galeote has just told us.
VOTE
We shall look into this.

That is missing from our resolution.
Conflict prevention
Property values
von Wogau Report (A5-0082/2001)
You have hit the nail on the head!'

We are voting against it.
Fava Report (A5-0060/2001)
This is not true democracy.
V√§yrynen Report (A5-0083/2001)
Things have not improved since then.
I would like to discuss three aspects.
Carraro Report (A5-0063/2001)
Martinez-Martinez Report (A5-0057/2001)
Purvis Report (A5-0080/2001)
There must be clear rules about this.

I therefore reject this report.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
This applies to India in particular.
Then you have the access to medication.
Of course price is important.
But that is still not enough.
Afghanistan
But we in Europe know better.
It signified something else entirely.
I think the contrary is true.
I can name three.
That is an absolute basic.
We cannot keep hiding behind alibis.
This is called rejection.
These are the words we must use.
Who is protecting the Taliban?
Who is supporting them?
Pakistan.
Who is protecting them?
Do I have to answer?
Can you answer with me?
It is like living in the Middle Ages.
My third point relates to Islam.
We must arrange a meeting.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
Situation in Zimbabwe
Our message is clear.
But is that the way we react?
No!
We need to do something about it.
No.
This is an important element.
He was an active member of the MDC.
It is not a one-way process.
This is unacceptable.
This is totally unacceptable.
I shall not do this!
We call once again for this to be done.
Situation in Kalimantan
I was there two weeks ago.
Situation in Turkmenistan
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Uncontrolled trade in light weapons
I will not say any more.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Disasters
Floods in Mozambique
Humanitarian disaster in Mongolia
Mongolia needs USD eight million.
I will be much obliged to you.
I now give the floor to Mr Maat.
I am here the whole evening.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Assistants' statute
I welcome this decision.
It does not wish to tackle tax issues.
Fine!
Strasbourg is the seat of Parliament.
Thank you. We look forward to them.
First, it must be simple.
Third, it must be transparent.
You have given us some good news.
The pace is to be speeded up.
We can all rejoice at that.
What is the current state of play?
We complied.
So, here we are.
What can be done?
Give us a legal basis.
Our fellow Members have said so.
I welcome this.
We have done that.
You have pledged to do this.
Mr Posselt on the rules of procedure.
We actually walk in.
That is even healthier!
VOTE
Before the vote on Kalimantan:
Before the vote on light weapons:
President.
I wish you all a safe journey home.

Adjournment of the session
(The sitting closed at 6.45 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
Agenda
Relating to Thursday:
President.
(Parliament gave its assent)
President.
However, we should not generalise.
This was not the Holy See' s policy.
(Parliament rejected the request)
This also applies to the Council.
Thank you, Mr van Velzen.
I shall check this with Mr Imbeni.
The order of business is thus adopted.
Speeches on procedure
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr Krivine.
Is this the punishment for resistance?
(Loud applause)
I am very much looking forward to that.
Investment services
In Europe we have many more than one.
This is very much under way in FESCO.
This may lead to rules that overlap.
The Commission agrees with that view.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Cosmetic products
Is this true?
No, it is not.
I would never want this.
Yes, there should be a test ban.
This is unacceptable.
So they have to be labelled.
I invite them to do so here and now.
I agree entirely with the rapporteur.
If they can, then change is needed.
It is not even the status quo.
It is not.
That is not the case at all.
We have to set a date and keep to it.
It is rather embarrassing.
What on earth will we do then?
We will be even more scared.
We cannot know about the WTO.
It is right that we hold the line.
We have to keep the pressure on.
.
Let me do so.
He refuted a deadly argument.
You are right!
The debate is closed.
Environmental issues of PVC
I would like to make this quite clear.
The second additive is cadmium.
The case of lead is quite different.
We find this hard to grasp.
This might well be the case.
What measures will we be taking?
Whose interests come first?
What ought to be done, then?
There are certainly alternatives.
We should not be taken in by this.
We are looking at a 60-year life cycle.
There was a huge number of responses.
Pension schemes and funds
I now turn to the issue of taxation.
So when is it going to arrive?
He mentioned social aspects and so on.
We have already had a discussion.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.38 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
(Applause from the left)
Thank you, Mr Seguro.
So that is the end of this item.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Decision on urgent procedure
That will please Commissioner Schreyer.
Let us find the courage to fight on.
I would like to start with enlargement.
Another major point is efficiency.
We need to develop mobility plans.
We hope to set a good example.
That is an objectionable development.
, rapporteur.
Why?
That is why we are concerned.
The other institutions do not agree.
This will not be the central issue.

(Applause from the right)
(Applause)

That is free.
It does not cost anything.
This is not acceptable.
That is just not on.
That is simply a matter of fact.
We are dealing with tax revenue.
We must utilise these appropriations.
But this is not just about more money.
But what a surprise.
We should investigate that more.
I wish to comment on several items.
These are essential.
This is extremely important.
It is still there.
That point is worth emphasising.
And why do we support this objective?
That is the number one priority.
We should be looking ahead.
Please get this sorted out.
It is time to break the deadlock.
That is certainly not chicken feed.
These are still on the Council's table.
EUR 6.15 billion are involved here.
We should not forget that.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Mrs Haug has the floor.
So that is the legal position.
So far, so good.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Discharges
Can you give me a name?
Thank you.
We take good note of its absence.
Your words will appear in the Minutes.
Mrs Stauner has the floor.
In 1999, things were simply a mess.
Some of us can surely confirm this.
The Committee saw all 12 Commissioners.
Agricultural policy is a good example.
How do they impact on legislation?
Do they operate efficiently?
The information is not now available.
Thank you very much, Mrs R√ºhle.
VOTE
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)

Before the vote on Amendment No 2
The change is in the word "continue".
Before the vote on Amendment No 13
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
It is nothing to laugh about.
This is an extremely important issue.
They are completely unnecessary.
It is extremely serious.

Haug report (A5-0101/2001):
Katiforis report (A5-0106/2001):
Kauppi report (A5-0105/2001):
Sacconi report (A5-0092/2001):
Why am I sad?
Allow me to quote a few examples.
Costa Neves report (A5-0102/2001):
Firstly, agriculture.
Secondly, enlargement.
The third area is the Treaty of Nice.
Yet, this is missing.
Buitenweg report (A5-0103/2001):
What about the others though?
Discharges (continuation)
, Commission.
We must learn from our mistakes.
The short answer is "No!"
We shall ensure that this happens.
.
We want more spending on SYNERGY.
Is this a discharge issue?
I defy anyone to disagree with that.
1999 - what a year that was.
You simply will not.
Firstly, things have improved.
The Commission has taken us seriously.
That is very positive.
We all know the system of milk quota.
No.
The situation in 1999 was different.
That is, of course, not the case.
That does not always happen.
Or let us take the case of flax.
I can understand that.
What are these issues?
Let me sum them up in four key phrases.
The first is the Fl√©chard case.
I am gratified to hear it.
No, we want tangible results.
The DAS must be positive by 2002.
It contains no proposed amendments.
You are absolutely right on this point.
Then he should come.
It looks at the way money is spent.
And what did we learn?
Thank you very much.
Yes, we know about this.
That goes without saying.
Mr Blak's report makes this very clear.
The debate is closed.
Foot-and-mouth disease
There is a consensus on this objective.
But the reality is far different.
Let me now repeat them.
There is no threat to human health.
This message must be driven home.
But they do not export the disease.
Even relatives are staying at home.
What did the negotiations achieve?
So, what do we do? We do not vaccinate.
What will need to be done?
(Applause from the right)
I hope it is.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Now it is dithering over vaccination.
In the case of pigs it can take 7 days.
I take an entirely different view.
Try it and see.
Instead, he did nothing.
Export interests are not sacrosanct.
I am also quoting animals in zoos.
We call for a joint approach.
A decision on vaccination is not easy.
This illogical approach is intolerable.
This is unacceptable.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt is right.
The positions are shifting.
We applaud them for what they did.
We have suffered greatly from that.
I said this last month.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Thank you very much, Mr B√∂ge.
President.
After all, it was scheduled for 6 p.m.
Commissioner Solbes has the floor.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
We still have a few months left.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
This item is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Part one
Question No 29 by (H-0263/01):
Question No 30 by (H-0300/01):
.
They are not our own figures.
Question No 31 by (H-0260/01):
Question No 33 by (H-0279/01):
Thank you very much, Mr Busquin.
Question No 35 by (H-0266/01):
Question No 36 by (H-0276/01):
Is that correct?
Have I understood correctly?
Question No 37 by (H-0311/01):
Thank you, Commissioner.
Its operating budget will also be set.
Yes, I wholeheartedly agree with you.
Question No 39 by (H-0249/01):
My latest trip to Skopje was yesterday.
It was his third trip in that period.
That is the path to Europe.
But I want to go further.
They are committing more troops.
They are making a greater effort.
Question No 41 by (H-0274/01):
Question No 42 by (H-0277/01):
People with disabilities
That is what we are aiming to achieve.
We must look at all the issues.
The same applies to the labour market.
Disability is not a static phenomenon.
We can implement changes.
I can only see two shortcomings.
It is no easy task.

The debate is closed.
It affects one woman in nine.
We think this is essential.
He is fully correct in his approach.
Therefore I can only accept it in part.
The debate is closed.
Golden shares
But there is a substantial danger here.
I cannot see it that way.
The source of law is the Treaty.
The Treaty is clear.
It did not do so without reason.
The Commission took energetic action.
The United Kingdom changed its policy.
That is what the Commission has done.
There is no need for a directive.
We have a treaty.
So we do not need a directive.
The debate is closed.
I shall do as you have just suggested.
Statement by the President
Secondly, the Galileo programme.
Thirdly, the financial markets.
Fourthly, the Community patent.
Fifthly, the single European sky.
Sixthly, postal services.
(Applause)
That is a good sign.
Please do something in this regard.
A little more modesty would do us good.
(Applause)
We get blockades.
(Applause)
(Applause)
But that is not the point right now.
That brings me to my final point.
(Applause)
I wish this success on both you and us.
(Applause)
I congratulate him on this agreement.
That is the only way to peace.
Our future depends on it too.
Commissioner Nielson made no response.
In Stockholm, the brakes were applied.
Will you succeed with your goals?
We have already mentioned Macedonia.
He is right.
The symbolism is crystal clear.
This brings me to my third point.
St Petersburg has been mentioned.
This is a crucial point for us.
Which brings me to my final point.
Reform of the EU is going too slowly.
This is an excellent ambition.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I have a second question.
What in fact does it mean politically?
Might it possibly be nothing but words?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Let us remove the obstacles.
My second point is method.
This is based on consensus, unanimity.
This is what this is about.
This is far from unimportant.
Now, a few words on the Lisbon Process.
It is far from simple.
It is no easy debate.
We can never ignore this.
I hope that we succeed.
This is a scandal.
(Loud applause from the right)
The Council does.
President.
I welcome the progress made thus far.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
VOTE
(Sustained applause)
(Parliament adopted the proposal)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote:
Is the Bureau aware of this or not?
Trakatellis report (A5-0104/2001)
I look forward to the second reading.
I saw Mrs Trakatellis as if in a dream.
Congratulations Mrs Trakatellis!
This is not the case, however.
Stauner report (A5-0112/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
Why is that?
Blak report (A5-0113/001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
And how?

van der Laan report (A5-0108/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
I do not support them.
Sepp√§nen report (A5-0097/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
R√ºhle report (A5-0109/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
Who were these giants?
Hermange report (A5-0084/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
It was only a dream, Mr President!
That concludes voting time.
It is unacceptable.
So what exactly is the problem?
We must do the job properly now!
Tomorrow will be too late!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Area of freedom, security and justice
The second issue is freedom.
Freedom is a product of justice.
Freedom is based on human dignity.
(The President cut the speaker off)
But the citizens do not know.
Tell us how you intend to move forward.
These are not national problems.
(The President cut the speaker off)
However, that is not the case.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Will crime and harsh reality decide?
Is this freedom?
It is intolerable.
Why does anyone leave their homeland?
But why has this happened?
This is incorrect!
Let us all work together to that end.
The debate is closed.
We must also be clear.
This is absolutely wrong.
This is absolutely unacceptable.
How coherent is our own policy?
We discovered these facts just now.
(The President cut the speaker off)
These are already well defined.
Take the example of Angola.
We need tangible results.
The list has not been finalised.
This general plan is now on the table.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0248/01)
Question No 2 by (H-0259/01)
Question No 3 by (H-0306/01)
I am here on behalf of Mr Papayannakis.
And Mr Solana did the same.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Question No 4 by (H-0290/01):
Question no 5 by (H-0299/01):
Question No 6 by (H-0251/01):
Allow me to mention two things.
The Member requests repetition.
Question No 7 by (H-0252/01):
No, we do not.
Question No 8 by (H-0253/01):
I do not know whether to laugh or cry.
Question No 9 by (H-0257/01):
Question No 10 by (H-0264/01):
'1.

Question No 11 by (H-0265/01):
Question No 12 by (H-0271/01):
Question No 13 by (H-0273/01):
Question No 14 by (H-0278/01):
That is to say, it is a national issue.
Question No 15 by (H-0280/01):
Question No 16 by (H-0286/01):
Question No 17 by (H-0288/01):
Question No 19 by (H-0294/01):
These limits are now far too low.
That is new.
Those rights are negligible.
This is a good thing.
Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
Not at all.
He has drafted it very carefully.
The previous speaker pointed this out.
They do not belong here.
That is, as I say, all well and good.

I shall refer to some of them.
The debate is closed.
Then the Council took its time.
I think this was achieved very well.
And a third point, if I may.
What is Parliament here for?

I said all' s well that ends well.
That is now being put right.
It is a pity it has taken so long.
Congratulations!
Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio.
You have been here for ages.
The debate is closed.
Money laundering
What are the core problems?
That was decided long ago.
We shall have a conciliation procedure.
It will soon all be possible in euros.
I fully support this extension.
They should be covered.
We know that.
I agree with Mrs S√∂rensen.
There are loopholes in this system.
I cannot.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Community programmes/Judicial network
Mr President, I shall do my best.
So much for this aspect.
I hope it will not disappoint.
It is a proposal on two levels.
The debate is closed.
I want to emphasise this at this point.
The introduction of soya may pay off.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Mr Chairman, you have the floor.
It concerns personal statements.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
What speed limit must it keep to?
What traffic regulations apply to it?
How and where are the points set?
And where does the journey end?
These are not academic questions.
That is precisely what Europe is doing.
(Applause)
(Applause)
It should consist of three sections.
(Applause)
That must be the guideline.

I am with you all the way!
(Long, loud standing ovation)
(Applause)
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Animal feedingstuffs/Vegetable proteins
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has the floor.
A real lesson in political culture.
This is now our task.
We are on the right track.
What were these findings?
This too has our full support.
That also applies to feedingstuffs.
We have turned them into cannibals.
The BSE crisis poses new dilemmas.
Thank you, Mrs Schierhuber.
It is usually fraud.
But the legislation is present.
.
This is clearly not satisfactory.
Thank you, Commissioner.
These are two separate issues.
Once again let me make myself clear.
Am I right in thinking that it would?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Mr Fischler has the floor.
It was little more than that, however.
These are the key points.
It is not impossible to solve, however.
Why did the negotiations fail?
Is another mandate possible?
We are in a political assembly.
I personally shall not.
This question remains to be answered.
I told the Minister as much.
The debate is closed.
, rapporteur.
We need a global approach.
It lies with the Member States.
Now I will come to the amendments.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Now, this is a fact, not empty words.
Mr President, there will be no debate.
Welcome

Piecyk Report (A5-0111/2001)

In this case, this may be justified.


Sanders-ten Holte Report (A5-0093/2001)
Camis√≥n Asensio Report (A5-0096/2001)
It does concern pensioners.
That is the connection, Mr President.
I find this fundamentally questionable.

They do not belong in this Regulation.

Third UN Conference (B5-0246/2001)
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
But we did not get that far.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Kyoto Conference objectives
on the Kyoto Conference objectives.
Their hand in this boycott is obvious.
The time has come for action and deeds.
Boycott Exxon, Texaco and Chevron.
What is President Bush afraid of?
It is not jobs or the environment.
I wish to make four brief points.
And now, to cap it all, Kyoto.
The survival of the planet is at stake.
That is why we must set an example.
Public opinion supports us in this.
This must not happen.
What has happened is deeply tragic.
It is completely unacceptable.
Were they able to prevent Seveso?
The problem is very serious.
It is under development.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
on violence towards Catholic nuns.
on the situation in Pakistan.
Abduction of Mr Tsiakourmas in Cyprus
Commissioner, I turn to you.
Violence towards Catholic nuns
Is this social justice?
The Vatican opposes such measures.
However, we should not generalise.
I voted against the proposal.
We must not go down this path.
Pakistan
We are obliged to do this.
Commissioner, we hope we will succeed.
The population must be freed from this.
It deserves sunnier prospects.
Rights of homosexuals in Namibia
End of quote.
A good example is South Africa.
Homosexual rights are human rights.

Situation in Mexico

Congratulations, Mrs Migu√©lez Ramos.
I support this proposition.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Professional fees
But this is a very serious matter.
This is very much to be welcomed.
I have now spoken for six minutes.
I will forego my last minute.
Let me give you two UK-based examples.
First, price: should this be regulated?
They need to be challenged.

Agenda
Relating to Wednesday 2 May:
Yes, Mr Wurtz, you are right.
(Applause from the left)
At that time, 17 prisoners had died.
(Applause from the left)
Thank you, Mr Wurtz.
I particularly wanted to mention that.
(Applause)
We can find a solution in two days.
What is the current situation?
You have access to this document.
Who are they trying to embarrass here?
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
It is because her husband has died.
We offer her our sincere sympathy.
(Applause from the right)
That was a unanimous decision.
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
Thank you, Mrs Hautala.
This is important.
I did not wish to use these arguments.
(Applause from the left)
We need to give it that time.
(Applause from the right)
That is very important.
(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
The reason is quite obvious.
The question is very complex.
I defend what you have done.
Thank you, Mr Tajani.
We have reached the end of this debate.
The conviction was upheld last week.
Thank you, Mrs Lynne.
Thank you, Mrs Scallon.
We need:
Mr President, I welcome the statement.
It is the best quality support.
We are not contemplating core funding.
This is what we are aiming at.
This is the self-confidence.
That is a disgrace to the world.
We can do more.
We are asking for a closer partnership.
The debate is closed.
The debate is closed.
That concludes the debate.
This case raises no such issue.
That concludes the debate.
Public access to documents
, rapporteur.
It is by no means a step backwards.
Is this Regulation now perfect?
This is a Russian wooden doll.
Fortunately, that is not the case.
That was not acceptable to us.
The Court too has to accept this veto.
All we can do is vote for or against.
This has now been firmly established.
The answer is no.
My answer is an unqualified yes.
The answer is an unqualified yes.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That needs to be stressed here today.
We certainly will.
What does sensitivity mean?
We are all very sensitive.
How will you interpret sensitivity?
There is money available for that.
It is a step forwards in many ways.
This is a reality which we must accept.
Many images have been used today.
We have acquired a powerful tool.
We must see how the new rules work.
Thank you very much, Mr Cashman.
The debate is closed.
Welcome
EU/FYROM Agreement
.
(Applause)
I could say exactly that.
However, you must do your part.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
At last, we have an agreement.
These frustrations are far-reaching.
But there is more.
That is a form of conflict prevention.
However, it is a fragile agreement.
Provocation.
It is a familiar tactic.
The debate is closed.
It is not.
That alone contributes to safety.
We want help for the Ukraine.
Meaning that they will die.
But we must have a minimum consensus.
So why no minimum consensus here?
We can understand that.
And why?
The financial problem is secondary.
Nuclear power is no solution.
It is not clean and it is not cheap.
Thank you for the debate.
The debate is closed
Thank you, Mr President.
Congratulations, Mrs Cederschi√∂ld!
My concerns are twofold, however.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Illegal substances - Synthetic drugs
That is not a fact to be too proud of.
I completely share that view.
That would be deeply regrettable.
These are the latest figures available.
Drugs cause harm when they are abused.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
It is not.
I do not mind underpinning the market.
That could be part of it.
Congratulations to all concerned.
All of this is of crucial importance.
That is a deciding factor.
Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
Movement of pets
Finally, ferrets.
I would happy to go along with that.
I am sure the Commission has too.
I would not like the job myself.
Remember it is 8 years down the line.
Therefore I can accept this amendment.
Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
Veterinary medicinal products
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
That is indeed the case, Mr Wurtz.
Stability and convergence programmes
What exactly is this report about?
What were they based on back then?
So what news on this front?
That is one very good point.
We must face up to these risks.
We can support it, as it now stands.
This is clearly absurd.
What, however, do we say about it?
I think that this is the way forward.
We all know why this is.
Others spoke along the same lines.
That is a long-standing debate.
Thank you again.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
The debate is closed.
Internet II
Malcolm Harbour mentioned this.
One point always needs underlining.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m.
Company accounts
Why do we need that proposal at all?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in Strasbourg.
(Applause from the left)
I rise on a point of order.
This is completely unacceptable.
We have taken note of your statement.

Agenda
As far as Thursday is concerned:
(Parliament gave its assent)
The agenda is thus adopted.
Speeches on procedure
Thank you, Mr Ford.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
Thank you, Mr Obiols i Germ√†.
It has not done so.
The Commission has still not replied.
Thank you, Mr Alavanos.
You can count on me to do that.
There is one essential point.
That is the position.
Yes or no?
There are, after all, two cases here.
Thank you, Mr Schulz.
The answer is no.
So far, I have received nothing.
Thank you, Mr Katiforis.
.
No, of course not.
We have reached agreement on warnings.
It was a remarkable conciliation.
I have three concluding observations.
Jobs are also at stake.
That is not universal.
These are not minor measures.
Now to come to the point.
Still, there are differences.
This will have to be a future task.
However, many people already smoke.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Animal nutrition
I think that this is very important.
Mrs Paulsen has just referred to this.
They need to be tightened up quickly.
Thank you very much, Mr Whitehead.
This is also only right.
We are moving towards an enlarged EU.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Mobility in teaching and training
I am happy with this report.
There is a mountain of red tape.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
on the one hand, on three reports:

What was the European added value?
What results were achieved?
I will not deal with that.

These things cost money, however.
Why?
Belgium has three.
There is a digital discrepancy.
We must tread new paths here.
These programmes have their purpose!
I hope we can go this way together.
We need to learn from best practice.
We need mobility.
What is the issue?
That is what today' s debate is about.
I feel the lack of that debate.
Let us reflect on that for a moment.
It is about subsidiarity.
To return to Bologna.
It is terribly embarrassing.
I fully support this.
We are on the right road together.
Firstly, the concept of subsidiarity.
The next point is lifelong learning.
The work is to continue.
The White Paper dates from 1995.
That is a long time ago.
That, at least, is a start.
This is a revolution!
Never!
Yet this is now being done.
It really is extraordinary.
Now, we are making progress.
A computer is only a machine, a tool.
We must also train our teachers.
This brings me to another subject.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
(The sitting was closed at 8.43 p.m.)
Mr President, on a point of order.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, I was present yesterday.
We will certainly rectify this.
(The Minutes were approved)
Broad economic guidelines for 2001
The necessary capital does exist.
This is now impossible.
That too proves to be impossible.
Greater coordination is not the answer.
Let us quickly look at its form.
This is not the view France takes.
What do we mean by that?
Now is the time for it to act.
I would like to expand on this.
That is essential too.
Please let us learn from that.
Nor is it within sole EU control.
We are part of a global economy.
We expect and demand better.
I will comment briefly on these issues.
The Commission believes that it cannot.
Thank you Commissioner Solbes.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Electrical and electronic equipment
The reason is precisely the latter!
I maintain the exact opposite.
There is no alternative.
I support this initiative.
The ultimate aim is waste prevention.
They are toxic and non-biodegradable.
Politicians now need to follow suit.
Why?
That is something I cannot understand.
I think that that is wrong.
I am pleased that that is possible.
I will mention one example.
This is a very important issue.
It seeks to promote eco-design.
Cars are taken to the scrap-yard.
Let me answer some of your questions.
The debate is closed.
Priority substances in water policy
Our group will not stand in its way.
2020?
Zero emissions is not a realistic aim.
Let us not forget that.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
VOTE
Amendment No 44:
It should have been in by 9 a.m. today.
So we have to vote as it stands.

von Wogau report (A5-0165/2001)

.
.
That is the very heart of the matter.
What are the solutions?
They affect families and societies.
This is a useful report.
It is not a directive or a regulation.
The debate is closed.
General product safety

We do not support this.
One is "where appropriate".
The debate is closed.
COM in beef and veal market
I think they might not.
It is a very long process.
We have seen the effects of BSE.
Your conversion need not be immediate!
That was the big mistake in Berlin.
We are in a period of crisis.
What are we actually asking for?
The rules were laid down in Berlin.
I think the UK has shown that.
We really have to move forward.
Destruction is also the key.
Mr Busk made a good point.
Why do we have then to destroy them?
The debate is closed.
Sustainable development strategy
I shall now give the floor to Mr Prodi.
That is fine.
He has some very good ideas.
The process, however, is very long.
I have two questions.
What do we want to talk about?
What is that process to look like?
What does this mean?
Question Time (Commission)
First Part
Question No 45 by (H-0432/01):
Question No 94 by (H-0393/01):
Question No 95 by (H-0424/01):
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
I have a similar question.
What are your views on this?
We must have intelligent sanctions.
What are we trying to do?
Perhaps I can repeat one other thing.
Thank you very much, Mr Patten.
Question No 48 by (H-0322/01):
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
What is the Commission' s position?
Question No 49 by (H-0361/01):
It has a different scope.
I shall be very brief.
Question No 51 by (H-0326/01):
I will be quite frank with you here.
Question No 52 by (H-0331/01):

I hope that you would not want that!
You are absolutely right though.
Question No 59 by (H-0349/01):
Question No 60 by (H-0350/01):
Question No 61 by (H-0363/01):
Many businesses also have a life cycle.
Question No 62 by (H-0365/01):


We need more realism here.
I welcome the Commissioner.
That is the heart of the matter.
The whole thing is a wasteful mess.
The Greenland agreement is different.
It chose to leave.
We do not owe it any economic aid.
We are dealing with fish.
This should be a commercial activity.
The debate is closed.
(President cut the speaker off)
Thank you for your attention.
The debate is closed.
Maritime safety
I do not make that point lightly.
That is one thing.
That is good.
Other efforts are required, too.
However, rules alone are not enough.
They have reacted well.
Let us move on to the proposals.
The problem is where.
The joint debate is closed.
Uniform driver attestation
That concern is not totally unfounded.
It was a joint effort.
It is as simple as that.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.25 p.m.)
Yet here they are in our own building.
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
Not at this moment, it would seem.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I agree with Mr Van Orden.
That is quite unacceptable, Mr Caudron.
First a positive point.
I find this unacceptable.
Welcome
Situation in the Middle East
Violence must stop.
Let me make that point crystal clear.
The position is absolutely clear.
There is no other way.
Thank you, Mr Patten.
That, however, is not the case.
The entire territory of Israel?
What territory?
And so the list goes on.
(Applause from the left)
Not in the view of my group.
What, then, is our policy?
There are no military solutions.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
This makes no sense. It is appalling.
What Mr Salafranca said makes sense.
We have now destroyed it.
I am surprised at such forgetfulness.
We should take a more objective view.
So what can the EU do further?
It is of major international interest.
A great deal has happened since then.
That is a sensible, balanced approach.
The debate is closed.
State of the transatlantic dialogue
I hope that will not happen.
It is an ambitious goal.
Let me end where I started.
So where are we today?
It is in some difficulty.
We need to do a lot more work on that.
Is it soft law or hard law?
Self-regulation or co-regulation?
I think not.
He is absolutely right.
But we need more than words.
But it is not just Kyoto.
But we must get down to work together.
A light is on, but it is not yet red.
The question is how we react.
No, of course not.
That must be our position.
The debate is closed.
VOTE
Mr Watts has requested the floor.
It is an important clarification.
President.
Thank you for that clarification.
After the vote:
Thank you, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Ludford recommendation (B5¬≠340/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
"Hello. Is Mr Fatuzzo there?"
"Speaking," I replied.
"What about?" I asked him.
Please help us!"
.
Better European rules were needed.
However, that is not the case.
We cannot compromise on safety.
Ortuondo Larrea report (A5-0144/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
President.
At last, I understand what is going on!
Now I understand!
van Dam report (A5-0151/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
Calendar of part-sessions
.
Stihler report (A5- 150/2001)
We have to address this issue.
It is completely unacceptable.
We need to address this.
Who would not do so?
We want to retain this system.
Sturdy report (A5-142/2001)
This problem has yet to be resolved.
Isn't BSE a good thing!
"I do hope not," replied the other cow.
I also hope that this will not happen.
I therefore voted for the motion.
The proposal is all too short-term.
That mainly means reducing prices.

And this is exactly what is happening.
.
Langenhagen report (A5-0129/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
Miranda report (A5-0128/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
That concludes voting time.
Situation of Turkish prisoners
This is a major human tragedy.
We all know that.
That is the problem.
How to create trust?
It is important to recognise that.
We must not forget human values.
All prisoners must be treated equally.
That is why we must speak out.
Naturally, I regret this incident.
I shall say no more.
And rightly so.
It is a scandal.
There is, however, one problem.
We have about 15 posts blocked.
The debate is closed.
Situation in FYROM
But we have no proof of that.
It is just not on.
You have to learn from your mistakes.
Now back to Macedonia.
I take up the Council's suggestion.
So what is to be done?
I think this is the right step to take.
However, we must think one step ahead.
That caused a row.
Thank you very much, Mr Katiforis.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Mr Ribeiro e Castro.
Mr Dupuis has the floor.
It has been discussed.
Mr Poettering has the floor.
We do not wish to do this.
We cannot collaborate in this.
That is my first point.
We would be creating a monster.
I should like to say three things.
That is a problem.
Combating social exclusion

to prevent risks of exclusion;
to rally all the parties involved.
That is, I believe, unacceptable.
Is that correct?
Is that also correct?
It is very difficult to change it.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Safe and sustainable pensions
Europe is ageing.
That is not how things stand, however.
There are two ways of approaching this.
It is essential to link the two.
I should like to mention four.
What will happen to security?
How will it affect women?
I believe this is unrealistic.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0323/01):

Question No 2 by (H-0325/01):
My second question concerns the future.
Question No 3 by (H-0329/01):
I cannot therefore comment on this.
Question No 4 by (H-0330/01):
The Council is not turning a blind eye.
I think we are all familiar with them.
Question No 6 by (H-0338/01):
We too have worked on this.
Question No 7 by (H-0340/01):
Thank you for your answer.
This is not new.
I nonetheless wish to ask a question.
We have compulsory registers.
If not, when will it be in operation?

Question No 8 by (H-0342/01):
You have the floor.
Such monitoring is taking place.
Questions Nos 9 and 10 lapse.
Question No 11 by (H-0348/01):

Question No 12 by (H-0352/01):
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office.
Question No 13 by (H-0353/01):
There are so many other dates.
Question No 14 by (H-0356/01):
Question No 15 by (H-0357/01):
Thank you for your answer.
The matter is clear.
I hope that it is on its way.
Question No 16 by (H-0359/01):
What improvements are planned?
Question No 17 by (H-0377/01):
Much has been achieved.
You yourself mentioned the Berbers.

Question No 18 by (H-0366/01):
That concludes Question Time.
Aid scheme for olive oil
We must reject this proposal.

The same applies to market balance.
Only 6% has been recovered so far.
Mr Casaca's report shows us how.
First to Mr Casaca's report.
I should like to comment on all four.
This is certainly a good idea.
The debate is closed.
Draft SAB 2/2001
That would have been too confusing.
That is a reality.
That is what it is all about.
It is very dangerous.
I really expected nothing of the sort.
At times we remember this and smile.
So support in principle is there.
Which is unacceptable.
That cannot be.
We should not start by being petty.
That cannot be.
We have the greatest respect.
Here too we are of one opinion.
We have our doubts.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
That sounds solid enough.
What will happen then?
We shall see.
Why are there no other options in situ?
That is best done locally.
We must be clear about that.
That would be the cheapest solution.
I consider that far too dangerous.
That would take us one stage further.
The other problem is buildings policy.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11 p.m.)
(Applause)
Our common Europe.
We have to jointly focus on two areas.
Europe is not only a map.
(Loud and sustained applause)
Are there any comments?
That is one thing.
The two are wholly unconnected.
The people are there.
We do not need any new posts.
Mr Ferber is right there.
(Applause)
Thank you Mr Provan.
I am joking.
There must be no repeat of this!
Quite, Mrs Pack.
The relevant provision was Rule 143.
That is what it says.
That was not the case.
Are there any other comments?
Quite, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo.
We will look into all that, of course.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Agenda
(Loud applause)
Thank you, Mr Poettering.
Afterwards, Parliament will decide.
(Parliament gave its assent)
That is completely inappropriate!
(Applause)
They are the political parties.
This is an open debate.
We have not taken drastic action.
There was no other way until now.
That is of key importance.
It should be the other way round.
There is more to say on this subject.
It had to be done in the twilight zone.
I do not think that this is the case.
Nevertheless they are still democrats.
We are not against Europe.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Please try to measure your words.
That is a political judgment!
However, what are political parties?
Nobody wants to talk about this.
That is incredible!
That is an exclusive rule.
This was in July 2000.
It does not really ensure transparency.
That is called organised corruption.
Parties are not an end in themselves.
Why this temporary status?
It is in the democratic interest.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
EUROJUST
We see that we can all cooperate.
We shall bring about practical results.
This gives rise to a few questions.
Who can access and use it?
The stakes are as high as they can be.
I would congratulate the rapporteur.
Fourthly and lastly, data protection.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in a moment.
Thank you very much Madam President.

Will Europe succeed?
Ferber report (A5-0138/2001)
'How are you?' asks the captain.
'Fine, and you?' answers the general.
'Not so good,' says the Italian.
'Why?'
'How much is it?
Oh, three times as much as mine!
Schleicher report (A5-0167/2001)
The same applies to European parties.
They are pariahs, vermin, scum.
They will be deprived of financing.
They will be prosecuted.
They will be dragged before the courts.
.
The word 'appear' is highly suspicious.
.
Today' s decision is premature.
There is no Community competence.
Next, democracy means transparency.
We cannot be bought.
Jov√© Peres report (A5-0137/2001)
Gebhardt report (A5-0153/2001)
Is this progress in common security?
That is deplorable.
Cercas report (A5-0147/2001)
.
We have more than enough to deal with.
.
The fact of the matter is simply this.
People are living longer.
People are leading healthier lives.
For that reason, I abstained.
So there you have it!
.

Buitenweg report (A5-0166/2001)
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Situation in Algeria
How exactly?
The situation is really very critical.
He has moved towards reform.
There can be no consensus here.
The joint debate is closed.
We cannot be deterred now, however.
We never liked this Agreement.
It is extremely difficult.
They will never be successful.
We also need to call a spade a spade.
We obviously need more practice!
Human rights
This is painful.
Cameroon
They deserve and have our solidarity.
Press freedom in the world
That is when freedom is at risk.
Mr President, I speak as a journalist.
We only believe in positive values.
The matter has still not been settled.
The trend is clear.
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
The debate is closed.
Forced labour by African children
In short, children are often slaves.
After all, we are all Europeans.
That is not done, however.
What is the point?
(Applause from the left)
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
The debate is closed.
I have an announcement to make.
Floods in France
Houses are subsiding.
That is the purpose of my amendment.
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
I could quote many examples.
Works councils and redundancies
I have hardly sat down.
This is often not the case.
Have I understood correctly?
What are your plans on this matter?
For which I also thank you.
That brings us to the end of that item.
Gas directive
Can we believe a word it says?
The debate is closed.
VOTE
The next item is the vote
Mr President, on a point of order.
You make a very valid point.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
'Great!
.
That concludes the vote.
Adjournment of the session
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
Agenda
The next item is the order of business.
This is what is called ENFOPOL 29.
It is a fundamental rights issue.
(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
(Applause from the Verts/ALE Group)
Specific technological R & D programme
This is the meaning of Article 169.
That is a major achievement.
What are the reasons?
We must encourage coherent action.
That was not my question, however.
I hope that this will now change.
Let us discuss this.
Thank you, Mr Caudron.
The proposal is, therefore, understood.
Studies of this type are planned.
They must step up their efforts.
I fully understand this question.
There is no contradiction whatsoever.
There are several angles of attack.
I have already mentioned this.
This is the negative aspect.
We are managing 14 000 projects.
That is our aim.
This is absolutely clear.
Thank you, Mr Nistic√≤.
Thank you, Mr Busquin.
The debate is closed.
Can I make a suggestion for the future.
It might help us.
Certainly, Mr Purvis.
Your suggestion has my support.
Treaty of Nice and the future of the EU
Why do I say this?
We want a convention.
Thank you, Mr Seguro.
That is a good sign!
, Council.
Europe must mean more than a market.
I think this is a good thing.
Democracy is not a zero sum game.
We need a combination.
I now look forward to your viewpoints.
That must be the starting point!
(Applause)
(Applause)
I represent fisheries policy.
It is only logical.
(Applause)
We must correct that.
(Applause)
It is a nice colour.
So best wishes for Gothenburg!
(Applause)
The forum now exists.
We, the EU, could not act.
If not NATO there was nothing.
It is the hour of the parliaments.
Long live the European Republic!
Nice has weakened the Community.
What kind of talk is that?
No, it has to be the EU √©lites.
What kind of view of democracy is that?
The Danish people are not being asked.
Be warned!
They are all extremely useful.
Of course it does.
Congratulations.
I do not believe that this is correct.
But no!
This has opened up the fight for power.
Where is the real cohesion?
Exactly the opposite.
Nothing more and nothing less.
Who is abandoning ship here?
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is not our view.
Why not Denmark and others?
(The President cut the speaker off)
So what will it be?
It is not a good solution!
I would call that into question.
They deserve our sincere thanks.
We do not need any new institutions.
That should be unthinkable.
The lowest possible number!
We have already endured that situation.
One thing is quite clear, however.
This is a cause for concern.
It is why we cannot say a clear yes.
We unite people, not states.
Mr President, five arguments.
I agree with much of the criticism.
This is something that we must change.
Let us not do this again.
How is this to be done?
What tools shall we use?
The answer is clearly no!
This was also its main task.
What is our common objective?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Council and Commission mission to Korea
In summary, the results were good.
The EU' s visit was a fruitful one.
Obviously we welcome the moratorium.
Thank you for your contributions.
Thank you for this additional response.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Environmental policy
No, it is not.
So what is sustainability?
This is not satisfactory.
The point has somehow been missed.
It cannot be simply an empty manifesto.
So what do these young people have?
What do they lack?
What do we owe them?
Many things have been considered.
Models for these exist.
However, that is often a problem.
We need the means to do so, however.
The PPE-DE will support the report.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The legislation must continue.
We must all realise this.
They must simply be phased out.
We cannot afford to keep them in place.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We need to acknowledge ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
I think this is clear in the programme.
This is naturally vital.
Thank you for this debate.
Council.
This is actually nothing new.
Thank you, Mr Larsson.
The debate is closed.
I wish them every success.
I see this as particularly welcome.

This has still not been done properly.
This is absurd.
We support the Commission.
One last but illustrative point.
That was when I read the communication.
There is always something missing.
Either list of examples can be used.
There is nothing about that at all.
What does "revising" mean?
Does it mean raising the standards?
So we need greater clarity here.

Hence the many amendments.
However, we should not despair.
First of all, compliance.
International agreements are important.
I would welcome this greatly.
I hope that I have succeeded in this.
Thank you once again.
This is what we learned.
Finally, we welcome this opinion.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
.
Thank you all.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
That is not true!
So more can be done than proposed.
Thank you, Mr Lange.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We proposed a great many amendments.
We stressed the independence of OLAF.
It is, after all, rather strange.
Its Kramer versus Kramer.
What would you do?
It seems a bit bizarre to me.
However, we shall see tomorrow morning.
Has this test been met?
Amendment No 72 sets this out.
Thank you, Mr van Hulten.
I want to be proud of what we do.
Around EUR 2 billion were lost.
Remedial action is more than necessary.
Do you wish to be heard?
You have the floor.
Thank you.
Mr Dell'Alba has asked to speak.
Mr President, it is 11.20.
That you intervened is a first.
Thank you, Mr van Hulten.
The debate is closed.
Compulsory safety belts
.
This is an important issue.
My answer is yes.
I think it is very important.
We know that safety belts save lives.
All these are good proposals.
However, we propose six amendments.
Development work is continuing.
That is where these systems fail.

We now believe that to be unnecessary.
Parliament thanks the Commission.
The debate is closed.
Equal treatment for men and women
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
You can count on my group at any rate.
It is terribly difficult to combat.
Victims feel they are alone.
Hence our amendment.
So much for equality!
Who are these associations?
We are women, wives and mothers.
They are still few in number.
I think this is excellent.
Why are they important?
Why is this directive so important?
Women still earn less than men.
I wonder if we should not provide one.
I introduced that in my own country.
Secondly, positive action.
Thirdly, equal pay.
Take the example of equal pay.
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
This will also make our job easier.
I would like to add two comments.
A mere 0.4%.
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m..

"Smart" airbags might be a solution.
Hautala Report (A5-173/2001)
Mr President, I voted for this report.
I hope not!
Why, you may ask.
Europe ought to have more money.'
.
Is that what we want?
Dell'Alba Report (A5-0176/2001)

Blokland Report (A5-172/2001)
Long live Mr Blokland!

But what does voluntary mean?
Parliament has completed its agenda.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 1.50 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
Relating to Wednesday:
None of you wanted this last week.
Thank you, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo.
This is completely possible.
Madam President, thank you very much.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Speeches relating to procedure:
The Irish people are a generous people.
It was a decision made in good faith.
We should not rush into a debate.
It is time for reflection and analysis.
Clarification is undoubtedly necessary.
I welcome his conversion.
I hope that Roger is enlightened now.
I believe we are different.
We have good people and bad people.
Thank you, Mr McCartin.
(Laughter and applause)
I warn against that.
Thank you, Mr Perry.
My question was very precise.
That was my question.
This is not the case at all.
This is clear.
Thank you, Mr Alyssandrakis.
I would like to bring up two points.
First of all, the death penalty.
This should be pointed out.
, rapporteur.
Any form of child abuse is ruthless!
The first example is penalties.
Where are the bottlenecks?
This is another important point.
However, I share Mrs Ludford' s doubts.
This is the first factor.
We added to them.
I do not think we can believe that.
What measures?
That is true.
Animal welfare
This is changing fast.
This is unfair.
How are the animals transported?
I greatly welcome this statement.
Viable solutions must be devised.
Cattle markets must be abolished.
This is therefore progress.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I trade them here, I trade them there."
They are not stocks and shares.
They are not speculative metals.
They are sentient creatures.
It will certainly have our support.
That is my guiding principle.
This figure is wrong.
This is a very important point.
I fully agree.
In addition to this, there is ICT.
But what about 'e-development' ?
This requires a targeted strategy.
At first glance, the answer is no.
That should not happen.
This is a realistic approach.
Mrs Dybkj√¶r's report is well timed.
This proposal would run counter to it.
The debate is closed.
Export and return of cultural goods
We also face other problems, however.
We need to start in Europe, however.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.55 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
I would like to see these included.
We have taken note of that too.
I checked this out.
That will be investigated, Mr Posselt.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Vote on requests for urgent procedure
We did not receive early notification.
European Food Authority
They are all there in due measure.
But they are not there in the title.
We go for merit every time.
We go for openness.
We go for transparency.
My own scepticism remains.
I commend this report to the House.
He has done a great job.
This is addressed by Amendment No 208.
Keep the number to 12.
First of all, there is safety.
Secondly, quality.
Fifthly, independence.
Let that be a warning to the Authority!
Have we forgotten all this?
However, I have one reservation.
Nothing else would be acceptable to us.
I also welcome Commissioner Byrne.
We must be able to trust them.
It is all about balance.
This policy should be maintained.
The stakes are therefore high.
Safe food must be produced.
This hypocrisy has to stop.
This is not proposed out of malice.
This is not proposed out of mischief.
It is proposed out of principle.
What signal do we want to give?
There are no such factors at this time.
This is a legal impossibility.
The other criteria are not acceptable.
Amendment No 215 is not acceptable.
Animal by-products
Category 1 covers risk material.
I would ask you to think this through.
First of all, let me thank Mrs Paulsen.
Public confidence has been destroyed.
My worry is about cross-contamination.
The same applies to foot-and-mouth.
We introduced strict controls.
Alkaline hydrolysis is one such method.
Omnivores really will eat everything.
We should not try to re-educate them.
We are faced with a very stark choice.
The reason is obvious.
We could accept a combination of both.
It is unrealistic.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Ozone in ambient air
I can understand that.
Such is the case with air pollution.
Problems remain.
In severe circumstances people die.
It refuses to go any further.
We do want to go further.
(Applause)
VOTE
Before the vote:President.
Pirker (PPE-DE).
That is logical.
.
.
I voted in favour of this report.
.
And I ate some excellent hot dogs!
We know the rest.
Karamanou report (A5-0206/2001)
We strongly condemn child pornography.
, in writing.
We strongly condemn child pornography.
.
.
.
Or have these rules been changed again?
Is that clear?
Thank you for your answer.
Klamt report (A5-0183/2001)
And he thanked me.
In reality, however, this is an alibi.
.
.
This brings out the worst in people.
.
Dybkj√¶r report (A5-0191/2001)
In fact I have voted in favour.
Aparicio S√°nchez report (A5-0122/2001)
That concludes the vote.
Ozone in ambient air (continuation)
In such conditions, what can we do?
The debate is closed.
WTO Panel/Section 211
Why is this so important?
I broadly agree.
There is no formal dialogue between us.
Let us return to the discussion then.
I can only regret this.
That is the first point.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I know nothing about any other meeting.
Thank you very much, Mr Danielsson.
The debate is closed.
ASEM process
We should maintain a balance.
That is why the committee's idea...
(The President cut the speaker off)
We have not reached that stage yet.
There are major paradoxes.
It is, of course, understandable.
But that is another matter.
This is clearly problematic.
That is not the point.
This opens up huge possibilities.
We addressed a multitude of issues.
I could have talked about Japan.
The debate is closed.
Development of the external service
This resistance must be broken down.
Let me offer a number of observations.
I hope the message is clear.
But it is a long haul.
Ambition depends on two things.
The debate is closed.
I have a few questions.
Can you say anything more about this?
The others are being examined.
Why is it not a longer list?
We are making quite good progress here.
Thank you Commissioner.
That concludes this item.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0437/01):
If not, why not?
I will be very brief.
Question No 2 by (H-0439/01):
That is hardly surprising.
Question No 3 by (H-0444/01):
Question No 4 by(H-0446/01):

Question No 5 by (H-0453/01):
Question No 6 by (H-0456/01):
That is what I call a short answer.
This is remarkable.
I wonder who does have responsibility.

Question No 7 by (H-0483/01):
Question No 9 by (H-0462/01):
What are you going to do?
Question No 11 by (H-0469/01):
Question No 12 by (H-0486/01):
Thank you for your answer.
Question No 15 by (H-0479/01):

I thank the Council for its reply.
Question No 16 by (H-0481/01):
Thank you very much for your reply.
Question No 17 by (H-0482/01):
Question No 21 by (H-0490/01):

I would like a response on that.
Protection of Community forests
The difference is EUR 0.07 per hectare.
That is to say, investment.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Why do I say this?
This innovation is therefore welcome.
My Group will support it.
At the moment this figure is 10%.
So the significance is far from small.
Two problems have been pinpointed.
In most cases it is very restrictive.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you for allowing me to speak.
The debate is closed.
We have a consensus on that.
That is a recognition of our dual role.
To conclude, my verdict is positive.
We therefore welcome them very warmly.
There are three reasons for that.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
They anticipate technical development.
We all know the ways of the market.
We have seen it happen.
We already have competition.
It of course requires planned funding.
Allow me to make five observations.
That would seem wrong to me.
We must pledge our support for this.
Balance in this report is important.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Structural business statistics
The debate is closed.
Silicone breast implants
Nobody would listen to her.
I cannot stress that too strongly.
We also talk about registration.
My group supports these proposals.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)
Certainly, Mrs Redondo Jim√©nez.
(Applause)
Every referendum tells a story.
That is not the point.
(Applause)
Firstly, sustainable development.
(Applause)
We must send out this message.
We must also be flexible.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We have come a long way together.
(Applause)
(Noise, heckling)
That is why he is right on this count.
(Applause)
Please help to bring it about.
(Applause)
That is how things are done.
That is a serious issue.
We want to focus on the alternatives.
So this backlash is hardly surprising.
The Treaty of Nice has come to nothing.
What should it decide?
But we should also examine ourselves.
There is another summit being held.
But we must also act globally.
War is better in a media society.
President Bush is coming to Gothenburg.
The summit must stake out such a path.
There must be a good result.
This is not democratic fiddle-faddle.
The Irish people have spoken.
The answer is "no".
We must respect that decision.
Please be careful.
The list is endless - take your pick.
The jury is out.
Do not listen to him!
(The President cut the speaker off)
It is disquieting.
The Irish lesson is a good one.
Thank you Ireland.
We have always maintained that.
Thank you.
That is not acceptable.
That is not so.
That is taking a huge risk.
They must not be denied that right.
We now need a sustained debate on Nice.
That is a disgracefully long time.
Why are they acting so cowardly?
And I also want to acknowledge this.
First and foremost, sustainability.
We must be careful of rhetoric.
Thank you very much, Mr Prodi.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
VOTE
Procedure without debate
Blokland (EDD).
I suggest that that should be added.
Before the vote on paragraph 8
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
In my opinion this is unsatisfactory.
Certainly, Mr Harbour.
Welcome
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Gothenburg European Council
I voted "against".
.

.
Only one non-party organisation did so.
They must not be denied that right.

You don't use them, do you?"
"What are you saying?" she replied.
.
.
I have voted against the proposal.
We cannot exclude the self-employed.
However, even this poses difficulties.
Why?
Secondly, competition.
Of course they are.
Why forget about the majority?
Let us be serious.
That was mentioned a moment ago.
That would not be the first one.
Our group has tabled two amendments.
I am sure that is true.
We shall not be alone.
We have a fast growing economy.
It is a tribute to his political skill.
This is now given fresh relevance.
Surely they can understand that.
He was quite right.
That said, let us get to the point.
Why?
You have no right to reply.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Maritime traffic
We must legislate for that.
Thirdly, the black box.
Each port or each ship is different.
It is dangerous.
Fifthly, ports of refuge.
The real safety work is done at sea.
, rapporteur.
This really is urgently necessary.
We must assume our responsibilities.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We think this is the right way forward.
(heckling: or Greifswald, Rostock)
Back to today.
Compensating the victims?
The maritime safety of our countries?
We want action and we want it now.
We regret that.
That is a contradiction in terms.
What is going to be done about this?
The third point concerns controls.
No one could say!
Beyond this, many other risks remain.
That alone was cause for concern.
We could apply this model here too.
Greek justice is taking action.
I believe we must mark out territories.
We are not prepared to accept this.
The perfect is the enemy of the good.
The debate is closed.
Occurrence reporting in civil aviation
My third point referred to Article 4.
Question Time (Commission)
Part one
Question No 32 by (H-0455/01):
Question No 33 by (H-0473/01):
.
I will try to explain.
I will name just a few.
We have a specific budget.
We cannot.
This is crucial.
So, does it improve delivery?
The reality is not so easy.
This is a highly significant point.
This is the real issue.
Question No 35 by (H-0461/01):
Question No 36 by (H-0470/01):
That is a fact.
But my question has a different aim.
They give names.
Is that correct, Mr Varela?
I see.
Question No 37 by (H-0445/01):
I hope so too.
Question time is closed.
That is the purport of Amendment No 11.
Safety precautions are essential.
To be honest, I cannot understand it.
The debate is closed.
Work equipment
A third point is training.
I think we need some new thinking.
I am only highlighting this issue.
We have not solved the problem.
It is a first.
That is quite a burden for business.
I worked at heights.
I worked on scaffolding.
I worked on ladders.
I have seen it.
These are not burdens.
Let us not forget that.
.
The debate is closed.
European Union's oil supply
Could we perhaps waste a little time?

(The President cut the speaker off)
What exactly is my point here?
Not with fifteen, with one.
But more can still be done.
However, this is easier said than done.
I support that paragraph.
There is no such thing.
What next?
Transporting energy is one problem.
I support local forms of energy.
These are the right solutions.
And this is the subject of this report.
Protection of pigs
Just the subject for a midnight debate.
I will reiterate them very quickly.
One of them was transport of animals.
I wanted to make this quite clear.
Mr Busk made an excellent job of that.
Now to the report.
That is the fact of the matter.
That is 3.3 times the cost.
These amendments cannot be accepted.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo
(Laughter, heckling: cynic!)
FYROM, Kosovo, former Yugoslavia.
We must find a way out of this impasse.
It is most strange.
And that is what we must secure.
Last year, the funding was 50-50.
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
We are not doing this at the moment.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, on a point of order.
I think he has the matter well in hand.
Thank you, Mr Bourlanges.
Thank you, Mrs Klamt.
We will deal with the matter.
So we had half an hour to spare.
Thank you very much, Mr Corbett.
Structural measures
Now briefly to the fisheries reports.
I can accept Amendments Nos 7 and 8.
Thank you.
I entirely agree.
Something needs to be done about it.
It sets a disgraceful example.
VOTE
Galeote Quecedo (PPE-DE).
Thank you, that was clear and helpful.

Direct support schemes under the CAP
This is fundamental.
The CAP aid schemes needed simplifying.
I see this as a very important point.
I can confirm that.
In other words they are minute.

That is what is important.
The reason is plain.
That is one of the this case.

Adjournment of the session

Resumption of the session
Membership of political groups
Agenda
Relating to Wednesday:
(The order of business was adopted)
Speeches relating to procedure
The flight was once again cancelled.
I therefore call on you to intervene.
Madam President, I will be very brief.
Madam President, on a point of order.
Mr Dupuis is quite right.
Resale rights
I do not think so.
Then there is implementation.
Artists do not welcome this either.
It is they who assume the major risk.
Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
What are we proposing?
Who is liable?
Those are only some of the proposals.
I consider that to be a modern concept.
That is important.
This must stop.
The legislation was adopted last year.
Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
This brings me to the amendments.
They could not function without that.
It comes in two forms.
We see examples of this across Europe.
This is vital.
That is deplorable.
Justice delayed is justice denied.
So the Commission fully supports this.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
COM in fruit and vegetables
There are, therefore, two problems.
This is not reflected either.
Why not consider direct aid?
So I too am adamant.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
We are here to talk.
We hope that they take the same view.
I am left with a few questions.
I welcome this.
Who lays down the standards?
Can we be stricter?
How do we go about this?
So how will you tackle this?
Then there is the phase-out.
Is it being repealed?
Firstly: the improvement of aircraft.
I find that disappointing.
We gave you a brief in March 2000.
We need you to stick to your brief.
We will be watching very closely.
We expect you do it.
They do not.
We must see the beginning of change.
This is clear: airports are necessary.
We have to see things fairly.
That is the current situation.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.59 p.m.)
The next item is the joint debate on:
There is a further demanding task.
Russia is just one important factor.
That was incredibly important.
That is important.
That is the signal.
Let it be just such a broad debate.
How is this to happen?
What is that development to look like?
What is possible in an enlarged Union?
The Union will grow.
The process is now irrevocable.
That is important progress.
First of all, climate change.
Secondly: public health.
Fourthly, the transport system.
(Applause from the centre and right)
(Applause from the centre and right)
But now for a critical comment.
You spoke about Fascist forces.
(Applause)
We should continue to follow this path.
I say that on behalf of all of us.
(Applause)
I know it was a delicate issue.
I congratulate you on it.
I have one or two other brief comments.
The peace remains delicate.
That alone is difficult enough.
The objectives were ambitious.
I should like to say the same.
A number of new objectives were set.
That, if anything, is a success.
Should there be a convention?
Yes, but a convention is not enough.
Turning next to Ireland.
Finally, a word about the riots.
We need a new approach.
The final balance is very positive.
First of all enlargement.
That is unacceptable.
May we never betray his memory.
They excel in wishful thinking.
Not at all!
Expectations are raised too high.
This is wonderful news!
I share his view.
But, Mr President, paper can wait.
We have heard too much idle talk.
Nice is not essential for enlargement.
We support the right to demonstrate.
We are against violence.
This is the way we have operated.
They are detailed.
That is more or less where I stand.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Takeover bids
That is the clear consequence of this.
I am a shareholder myself.
That is the key problem.
That is why it must be rejected.
Then we had conciliation.
(The President cut the speaker off)
It would be shocking not to do so.
But they have far less at the moment.
None of this is law at the moment.
That must be included in the rules.
Things can change.
Mr President, one final point.
That is not an argument, in my opinion.
It is worthless.
What did we achieve in conciliation?
There are minimum standards.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We are all guilty of talking.
(Applause)
We shall now proceed to the vote.

ECB and the euro
Welcome
Mr Toledo, welcome to this House.
ECB and the euro (continuation)
The launch date is 1 January.
That applies to all of us, in fact.
It benefits the public.
That is not how things work.
It would also be a sign of wisdom.
The Paragraph in question is the ninth.
We want an independent Bank.
No, there is not.
It does not.
This is the out-dated 'shield' theory.
Thank you very much for that.
That cannot be altered now.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I wish to add some points.
I agree with her completely.
The answer is "no".
We encourage that.
Why is this directive needed?
What is this directive about?
It is a financial services directive.
This clarification is necessary.
Nor is it a compromise.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The debate is adjourned until 9 p.m.
I will expand on each of these axes.
Second is financial sustainability.
What is the proposed procedure?
Why have an integrated approach?
Employment strategy is one example.
A second example is public finances.
What will the Commissioner do?
(The President cut the speaker off)
They will never talk about pensions!"
I have a couple of questions.
This will become essential.
So far so good.
Question Time (Commission)
Part 1
Question No 27 by (H-0541/01):
The short answer is 'no'.
Question No 29 by (H-0539/01):
We are awaiting a reply.
It is very important.
Questions to Commissioner Lamy
That is a very good question.
Has there been any discussion on this?
Do you believe this is a possibility?
If you want to run this risk, do so.
I will handle it.
This is our position.
Question No 33 by (H-0565/01):
Thank you, Commissioner.
You have no official data.
This was the thrust of my question.
Unemployment continues to fall.
Italy is included in both groups.
Question No 34 by (H-0578/01):
The problem of Montenegro is similar.
You have raised a different problem.
But I thank you for your intervention.
Questions to Mr Monti
Question No 35 by (H-0535/01):
Yes, it has been a long period.
I agree with you about that.
That will depend on the facts.

Thank you very much, Mr Berenguer.
Question No 37 by (H-0551/01):

.
Question No 38 by (H-0557/01):
Is this your final opinion?
I will concentrate on that issue.
Security can only come after that.
There is nothing new about that.
How should this be done?
No answer is given to this question.
How will this be solved?
There are a number of such questions.
A na√Øve thought.
That is anything but sufficient.
What are your plans in that connection?
I will not be part of that majority.
That implies enormous risks in old age.
That problem has not been solved here.
I will put it in Aristotelian terms.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Things will no doubt hot up then!
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I am firmly convinced of that.
She has made considerable progress.
Congratulations again to Mrs Rothe.
Where should we focus our attention?
This is a large proportion.
It is sound work.
We must remain realistic.

Firstly, the issue of biomass.
This is a key pioneering initiative.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

.
We do not want to over-complicate it.
It has to justify its existence.
That is very important.
We will become ".EU".
We know that a lot has gone awry.
Just remember the "Amsterdam.nl" case.
That is what Amendment No 24 is about.
Finally, my third point.
The debate is closed.
Radio spectrum policy
Amendment No 25 concerns transparency.
I believe that that is not the case.
What can we do?
Not easy, but it has to be done.
It is almost a little absurd.
That would be too much.
I often get complaints from CB users.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)
Thank you, Mr Cossutta.
Mrs Thyssen, I have noted what you say.
Programme of the Belgian presidency
I shall return to this subject shortly.
We have a duty to stop this trend.
No, it is not.
(Applause)
(Applause)
You mentioned Laeken.
(Applause)
My third point is transparency.
We firmly support this.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We support this.
We are at your side!
(Applause)
We need one.
That is one of our moral commitments.
There are ample reasons for this.
You mentioned globalisation.
This is quite a serious misdiagnosis.
Do the European citizens know this?
(Applause)
Respect the Irish 'no' vote.
Their symbolic value is great.
A final point.
I shall now come back to three points.
I wish you every success.
No, it is not.
It is a so-called structured debate.
The delay is unacceptable.
But more is required than that.
The Feira Summit is my last example.
This charter has gone unheeded.
The one must be linked to the other.
Euronews is financed by Europe.
Make it a project, Prime Minister!
Well, I find that a reductionist view.
The problem must be tackled.
That strikes me as better advice.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Verhofstadt.
The debate is closed.
Situation in FYROM
I just want to underline this point.
Nevertheless, I have two concerns.
This is a very tricky business.
Of course, aid is not automatic.
I would be very careful about this.
The world was too small.
Is the Council involved?
How come we have lost Mr Robertson?
We have heard you quoting Mr Badinter.
What are Mr Badinter' s views?
Do you support that?
More is the pity.
There is no symmetry.
We need to state this openly here.
They failed to do so.
Europe has done no such thing.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
(The President cut the speaker off)
VOTE
Did you vote on this matter?
No, Mr McMillan-Scott, I did not vote.
(Mixed reactions)
I believe that is the point.
(Mixed reactions)
I acted as my conscience dictated.
It is their decision.
This result is absolutely clear.
I congratulate you on this.
I should like to thank you for this.
(Applause)
I fully respect your personal choice.
Before the vote
Thank you, Mrs Rothe.
Regarding Amendment No 11
Very well.
Before the vote on Amendment No 118
It was a minimum requirement.
.
.
Hence our abstention from voting.
.
Our approach must be coherent.
We have therefore voted in favour.
.
Yet the opposite is the case.
What are the problems?
1.
2.
3.
4.
What kind of logic is that?
.
.
I hope the debate will continue.
The Council wants to include it.

The reason for this is as follows.
.
Maaten report (A5-0222/2001)
And it is still going on.
.
This is not a trivial matter.
Welcome
Let me explain myself.
I think we had to do so.
Lastly, it is a reference document.
Quite the contrary.
At any rate, that is my hope.
This paragraph was also removed.
That means it is still very young.
Third ideal: equality.











(Applause)
Clearly, it has achieved its objective.

Their time will come!
Earthly justice will prevail.
We need it now.
We will continue to do this.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
They are both very good reports.
(The President cut the speaker off)
They have no place here.
We must guard it like watchdogs.
What could be a more welcome outcome?
I think we have to.
That must stop.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is what I wanted to say to him.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We need to apply even more pressure.
Nowhere.
What is the European Union doing?
However, there is one problem.
A great deal of cowardice.
Mr Schroeder? Mr Blair?
Mr Chirac? Mr Jospin?
What has changed in the meantime?
There is a committee ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is what we want.
Perhaps indeed a little too exhaustive.
This was why I was not in the chamber.
We have already talked about this.
We all agree on this.
I will give you three examples.
Words should be followed by action.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Bonn Conference on Climate Change
First and most crucially: money.
Are we prepared for this, I ask?
These need to be resolved.
Making a verbal commitment is easy.
We all know that.
This is very disappointing.
What is the solution?
Bonn needs to be a success.
Thank you very much, Mr Liese.
The joint debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
We only have 40 minutes.
We have been economical.
Even with Rule 19, I have flexibility.
Question No 1 by (H-0516/01):
Question No 2 by (H-0518/01):
Question No 3 by (H-0520/01):
Question No 4 by (H-0522/01):

Question No 8 by (H-0560/01):
Question No 9 by (H-0531/01):
Question No 10 by (H-0547/01):
Even Luxembourg has more!
Question No 11 by (H-0545/01):
I am afraid I cannot guarantee that.
I would be a fairy if I could.
Question No 12 by (H-0550/01):
Question No 13 by (H-0553/01):
Question No 14 by (H-0555/01):
I have taken note of your remarks.
This also required courage.
This is a positive development.
It was not a pretty sight.
Macedonia has been mentioned.
But history will have the last word.
Thank you very much.
We are cooperating via two channels.
Secondly, the political conditions.
Of course it is exceptional assistance.
Of course it is of a temporary nature.
There are two problems.
This is not the real difficulty.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
It is simply not listening!
We want complete budgetary autonomy.
... of the Belliard building.
I think this is also worth mentioning.
(Applause)
.
I should like to put this to you now.
I think this is wrong.
This also deserves criticism here.
My second point is this.
Explain that to the European public!
We are handing back billions!
We must move away from this situation.
We must be able to manage this.
This is no mere accident.
I accept that.
I applaud that.
It comes around every year.
We are all highly taxed.
It is almost inevitable.
(Mixed reactions)
This is acceptable to the Commission.
That is the law as it stands.
That is what it says in the Treaty.
That is where it really belongs.
That is not what it is about at all.
Now to Mr Costa Neves' s report.
That cannot be true.
The letter has no other meaning.
It was entirely businesslike.
I just wanted to explain that.
Thank you.
Thank you Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Management of Community programmes
That is not our objective.
That may be right.
Mr Bourlanges has just mentioned that.
There is still room for improvement.
That is a major improvement in my view.
That is our strong view.
My warmest congratulations.
Mr President, just a brief word.
The debate is closed.
Safe operation of mining activities
That does require regulation.
We think it is excellent.
This dialogue is already taking place.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Coastal zone management in Europe
That is completely unfair.
Otherwise governments just ignore it.
This has to be addressed.
Another issue is climate change.
This has to be taken into account.
This should not be allowed.
No crabs, no tourists, no money!
Why a legal framework?
This is what we should be doing.
But such good work can be undermined.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.10 a.m.)
I wanted to say that in this House.
G8 Summit
I will just make one final point.
I feel that is a tragedy.
Will these decisions be taken at Genoa?
Where is Europe?
Europe remains silent.

We need much more than that, however.
Why?
When will these things happen?
We need these political answers.
The debate is closed.
Recreational craft
We need to retain this.
That much is obvious.
The debate is closed.
I recommend we approve this report.
It is about the Montevideo Convention.
Without them, success will elude us.
That is, surely, not justifiable.
I say that without any qualification.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
VOTE
I think that is a very important point.
Haug report (A5-0238/2001)
I have voted against the proposal.
Costa Neves report (A5-0241/2001)
Niebler report (A5-0232/2001)
Mr President, it is the year 2005.
McKenna report (A5-0219/2001)

Callanan report (A5-0218/2001)
Brok report (A5-0244/2001)

Wuori report (A5-0193/2001)
Cornillet report (A5-0223/2001)
It is unworthy and intolerable.
It must end as soon as possible.
Otherwise we will abstain.
That is going too far.
That cannot be allowed to happen.
That concludes voting time.
Death penalty in the world
We have therefore made progress.
It puts one in mind of the Middle Ages.
This cruelty outrages and horrifies me.
Such cases have occurred in the past.
It is cruel and inhumane.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Fair hearings are denied.
Sport cannot be divorced from politics.
For that there can be no excuse.
That is not the case in China.
That is why there is hope.
The Chinese are a patient people.
I feel certain of this.
I recommend it to the House.
I do not believe that I am being naive.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Human rights
We have therefore had some successes.
So 29 countries have signed up to it.
Only four countries have ratified it.
I very much appreciate them.
We shall not vote against.
We must secure that, at least.
Happily now we can discuss them.
But the situation is shameful.
There is cause for hope, however.
Religious freedom in Vietnam
(The President cut the speaker off)
Do you really wish to speak now?
You were quite right, Mr Patten.
This is completely unacceptable.
This is completely unacceptable.
South Africa
All this was discussed at length.
That is not all.
We need to work on this.
Belarus
Once again, an understandable attitude.
Can you imagine?
It is intolerable.
These people were poor before.
They are even poorer today.
I now turn to Belarus.
I welcome this timely debate.
How could we not be?
Thank you very much Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
It must not stop at empty words.
We can get them round the table.
It is a complicated game.
That is clear.
We can make everything dry up there.
Thank you very much Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Earthquake in Peru
That says it all.
The Commission reacted very promptly.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
I find that deeply regrettable.
We support that.
We think it is a good idea.
My report comes later.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
I agree with you wholeheartedly there.
I agree with you wholeheartedly here.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Cod stock in the Irish Sea
Thanks also to the Commission.
I certainly welcome that.
I hope it is successful.
That must be welcomed by everyone.
Do these new methods have an effect?
That is the way forward.
The situation is no longer sustainable.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
VOTE
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report A5-0214/2001

Report A5-0188/2001
That concludes the vote.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 6.45 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Tribute
Statement by the President
Unfortunately, this cost him his life.
(Applause from the PSE Group)
(Applause from the PPE Group)
Thank you, Mr Poettering.
Agenda
It is therefore a matter of urgency.
(Parliament rejected the request)
President.
Relating to Tuesday:
Relating to Wednesday:
), rapporteur.
Why?
(Parliament rejected the request)
So, how shall we deal with this?
Fine.
(Parliament rejected the request)
Speeches relating to procedure
Parliament has a major role to play.
And ... then I went for a swim!
I shall do so, Mrs Morgantini.
Today, 500 people remain in custody.
Once again, I shall certainly do so.
I spoke about 1977.
European Company Statute
We must get a foot in the door.
He is quite right.
I should know.
It is not perfect.
What complete disorder!
I do not want to go into the details.
So we do not need Parliament.
This is the strategy of the Council.
Why should it be adopted?
So what are the advantages?
I, for one, cannot see any.
We can be very clear about this.
The rapporteur refers to taxation.
Why is that?
Very little has been produced.
As has been said, this is voluntary.
Other changes might be needed.
Too often EU laws get set in stone.
We are agreed upon the objectives.
European works council
However, every light has its shadow.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That also needs to be tightened.
The Commission' s report shows this.
This is vitally important.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The general diagnosis remains the same.


That is obvious.
What does more Europe mean?
Thirdly, equality.
This is a fundamental problem.
We do not think so.
We need to be aware of these issues.
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
Commission reform
We do not want to disrupt that process.
Today, EUR 600 million is stated.
In any case, we need a response.
We certainly intend to do that.
We are worried.
You are going to produce a new version.
When will this be?
I could go on and on.
You know that you have our support.
We want you to take risks.
All these points go together.
I would love to be offered the same.
Maybe they are in my office.
My problem is not English.
So what is our main cause for concern?
No more no less.
Mr Miller refers to timing.
That is an apposite point.
That is why we are not rushing.
We have kept our promises.
That is not in anybody's interests.
We have not finished the reform.
Thank you, Mr Dell'Alba.
The debate is closed.
Are there any comments?
We will correct that, Mr Corbett.
(The Minutes were approved)
Thank you.
We shall look into this very carefully.
There are no other points of order.
Situation in the Middle East
What is the alternative?
(Applause)

(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the GUE/NGL Group)
Any other suggestion is just hot air.
(Applause from the TDI group)
How can the EU respond?
Firstly, the will of the two sides.
Nobody can grant what is not theirs.
It is that simple.
That is something I regret.
We all know exactly what is going on.
Without a doubt, Europe must act.
Why do we not say so openly?
Why do we not make the situation plain?
What did Mr Arafat do?
He said no to peace at Camp David.
The precedents are not good.
What else can we do?
So Mr Sharon has not seen Mr Solana.
Has the Council been informed of this?
I should like to know.
Thank you, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck.
I wish they did convey such a message.
That is what we should be doing.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
We must not erect further new barriers.
(Applause)
Why enlargement?
Enlargement is the future of Europe.
I am, of course, referring to Turkey.
Misunderstandings must be cleared up.
Enlargement offers enormous scope.
Then we agreed on this Tuesday.
(Applause)
(Applause)
It need not be 10, but it may be 10.
We are prepared for that.
There are many points there.
That is correct.
Funding up until 2006 is secured.
Most surely not.
It has its price.
But non-enlargement is expensive, too.
It costs much more than enlargement.
We must be quite clear about this.
Welcome
This is a remarkable statement.
Temelin has significant safety defects.
We ought to investigate this.
VOTE
That is the text that we are voting on.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Hans-Peter Mayer report (A5-0243/2001)
Hopefully this will now do that.
.
I know the problem.
They always have something else to do.
Menrad report (A5-0231/2001)
We refuse to approve this farce.


Menrad report (A5-0282/2001)

Flexibility, not rigidity, is required.
We are no further forward on this.
.
.
Blokland report (A5-0267/2001)
.
Koukiadis report (A5-0250/2001)
.
It is not a straightforward issue.
The European Union is not rigid.
The accession process is continuing.
The cold war is over.
Malta is not a country in transition.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Opinion polls show this.
That seems to me to be self-evident.
I think we need to look into all this.
We have reached an important stage.
We look towards the goal with optimism.
I welcome Mrs Souladakis' report.
We do not want to be accomplices.
.
The same applies to me.
But there is more.
I repeat what I said this morning.
That is absolutely certain.
I fully agree with this.
Solutions need to be found here.
If it is a means, what is the end?
Firstly, in the political field.
We can only fully agree with him.
First, the timing of the debate.
Why should this be the case?
I think this is too soon.
This is the problem.
Mr President, two topics in one minute.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Mr Prodi.
The White Paper is a departure point.
Correct.
That is one important aspect.
That brings me to my second point.
But we need to strengthen it.
Are you for or against it?
(Applause)
That is positive.
Neither have you, I hope.
But I have other concerns.
So, Mr President, be bold!
Which issues cross borders?
Which can we not manage for ourselves?
All the rest is just idle chit-chat.
Therefore, we must endeavour to adapt.
Finally, relations with Parliament.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Part I
Question No 37 by (H-0602/01):
Question No 38 by (H-0639/01):
Question No 39 by (H-0641/01):
The situation is extremely complex.
Naturally one is interested.
Second part Questions to Mr Busquin
Question No 40 by (H-0606/01):
Questions to Commissioner Nielson
That is the reality on the ground.
So, what is happening at the moment?
This work is in progress.
We need indirect arrangements here too.
Question No 41 by (H-0604/01):

A broad-based effort is necessary.
Question No 42 by (H-0613/01):
Question No 43 by (H-0616/01):
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Nor has my own country been spared.
The principles are totally unchanged.
I do not think we have a problem.
We definitely agree on the subject.
Question No 44 by (H-0614/01):
Who is stopping you?
Question No 45 by (H-0636/01):
Question No 46 by (H-0666/01):
I will be brief.
We have to address that issue.
That is the core of the problem.
We want to get at the truth.
That should be the ambition of us all.
That is as much as we can say now.
I cannot be more precise at the moment.
Questions to Mr Liikanen
Question No 48 by (H-0600/01):
Question No 51 by (H-0617/01):
Question No 52 by (H-0620/01):
Question No 53 by (H-0629/01):
I will check the situation today.
Question No 54 by (H-0645/01):
This process is now well under way.
There is no going back now.
A real change has to take place.
I hope so - it certainly did mine.
But overall the agreement is weak.
You have still a lot to do.
I thank you again.
These issues are of concern to us.
But it is an important first step.
Well done.
I just wanted to point that out.
This requires research and innovation.
It is now time for action.
We can change and develop it.
I would like your cooperation.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Safety and air transport
Finally, accountability.
We need far greater clarity.
To be delayed is a nuisance.
I condemn Mr Titford for so doing.
The research is ambiguous.
There is no need to be an alarmist.
This is crucial.
.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
That is a contradiction in itself.
Something needs to be done here.
I see two points at issue here.
Austrians trusted in Europe's word.
We do not need vox pops!
Just two more brief comments.
That is what we should be fighting for.
Why do I say this?
Please read it.
Perhaps.
You are wrong, Mr Swoboda.
Mr President, if you lose, you lose.
Exactly what are they then?
The debate is closed.
Cultural cooperation in the EU
I should like to make a few points.
So my warmest thanks.
One final comment.

What values should they defend?
I will return to this subject.
Point 9: Structural Funds.


I am delighted with this initiative.
Point 12: the contact points.

Points 13 and 14: the Cultural Forum.
Points 15 and 16: patronage.
Together, we shall get down to the job.










As you can see, nothing has changed.
The credo remains.
In my opinion, they are fundamental.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.10 a.m.)
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Echelon
Its name, however, is irrelevant.
How do we assess these findings?
It is not a problem of quantity either.
It is, in other words, an ultima ratio.
I can see the logic of that.
Why ever not?
This mistrust has to be weeded out.
That is the perennial problem.
(Applause)
The five suspects are also silent.
A change in mentality is required.
This is the real threat to us all.
This is something we deplore.
This situation is now very different.
Did you hear that, Commissioner?
That is nothing exceptional.
If so, what does it do?
We can conclude that the system exists.
'Who watches the watchmen?'
I know of no country in which it works.
So in my view it is no solution.
My second remark concerns encryption.
What is actually happening over there?
That is worrying.
These build up a body of evidence.
Privacy is a fundamental right.
We need to empower them.
I will highlight some of them.
Thank you very much for that.
I thank the members of the committee.
(Applause)
Combating terrorism
Such measures should not be necessary.
Trafficking in drugs is one example.
It has been a diluted discussion.
Action on that is imperative.
We must end safe havens.
They use certain words and pseudonyms.
We have to recognise the victims.
There must be mutual recognition.
This too is a form of terrorism.
I am only going to make two points.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.

Conclusions of the G8 meeting in Genoa
There is no more talk of that.
In my view, that is essential.
I will not go into that today.
Is a European way possible?
That is proof, Mr Ferri!
This is the real problem facing us.
What is our response?
What is this Parliament' s response?
I was in Genoa for a week.
I visited the prisons.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We are going to do all of this.
But that is part and parcel of it.
I wish to make that very clear to you.
Of course they do not go far enough.
We also have the Schengen Agreements.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

No one wants a big brother society.
I now turn to the Cappato report.
Why?
It is like old times.
I bet you are really glad to be here.
It is a dialogue with the deaf.
We made our point.
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.
You take 1.9 million off it.
It just does not make sense.
It is in reserve.
You did not even respond to that.
We are extremely prudent.
The margin is, of course, decreasing.
That is a priority for us both.
That concludes this item.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0594/01):

It cannot be prevented.
Question No 14 by (H-0621/01):
Question No 15 by (H-0623/01):

Question No 18 by (H-0628/01):

You may have beaten the record.
Will you do that next?
Progress has been made.
I have tried to convince you of this.
She always has the opportunity.
Question No 20 by (H-0635/01):
You are absolutely right, Mr Marinos.
Thank you very much.
Question No 21 by (H-0637/01):
That reply ends this debate.
Statement by the President
Why do we have this situation?
I will not go into detail.
Then you must actually pay for them.
I think that action is needed here.
I will start with the Cappato report.
I want to be crystal clear.
This is starting now with SMS messages.
There is no harmonised system.
It is something anybody can try.
I have done it myself.
I am not optimistic.
I mentioned two of these earlier.
But I have to ask him another question.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Implementation of competition rules
We want it scrapped.
"A bit pregnant" cannot exist here.
Thank you very much.
In any event, I will not use it up.
I welcome decentralisation.
It cannot guarantee legal certainty.
Article 3 is clearly vital.
Two final remarks.
That is the heart of the problem.
It is anything but decentralisation.
It will all end in tears.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
This system applies to Member States.
Absolutely not.
And that system must be maintained.
In my opinion, no.
This is subject to a technical debate.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
What exactly is at issue here?
That is exactly the case with octaBDE.
I mentioned that just now.
They are toxic.
I hope the Commission notes that.
The general conclusions are clear.
I commend the report to the House.
Pentabromodiphenyl ether.
What' s in a name?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

This cannot be overlooked.
The first reason is ethical.
That is one reason.
This directive is essential.
The human body is not a commodity.
Firstly there is a safety risk.
There is also an ethical risk.
There is one already.
We can accept in full 29 amendments.
First, ethical questions.
Many of you referred to studies.
You have the floor, Commissioner.
Thank you very much, Mr Nistic√≤.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.13 a.m.)
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
But it does not.
(Applause)
rapporteur.
The European Union is a great ideal.
One, it must be based in law.
Spain, is just one example.
They are alien to our tradition.
This is very important.
Applause
The Ombudsman is patient, however.
I wish Mr S√∂derman every success.
I do not think it is appropriate.
The first is the White Paper.
We are quite determined to do so.
We try to rectify the situation.
Thank you, Mr S√∂derman.
The debate is closed.
Petitions
There have been many successes.
That is our first problem.
Why would they?
The debate is closed.
That seems elementary.
The second case, that of honey.
The third case, that of fruit juices.
A positive list should be given.
This is creating problems for us.
There is no such thing.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
No such decision has been taken.
VOTE
You can now do one of two things.
I do not understand why.
Mr Nistic√≤, you said two things.
That is the reasonable order.
Is that right, Mr Nistic√≤?
Absolutely right.
President.
I see more than twelve Members.
(Applause)
That was not the agreement.
I fear we may have voted in error.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE

TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Zimbabwe
No comment.
Food aid will be a different matter.
That makes it extremely important.
Mugabe must accept such a solution.
They are hungry and unemployed.
It is plainly about politics.
The communities come together.
He is not listening to placations.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Foot-and-mouth disease
The figures make our heads spin.
Let me be clear about this.
This is not a loss of production units.
The Cairns group would be happy.
Doha would be a success.
Another question.
A further question.
There were no disinfection points.
We must look at that.
The reason is simple.
A word on vaccination.
Is that a successful policy?
But BSE was a new disease.
That was a genuine European inquiry.
The same applies to foot-and-mouth.
We are talking fatal consequences here.
We need marker vaccines.
So what is the Commission' s opinion?
That is just one aspect of this issue.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
Togolese Republic
Kingdom of Cambodia
Republic of Mauritania
What, then, is that constitution worth?
He has done well.
I saw their lifestyle.
Togo
Democracy is still a fleeting ideal.
This must be stopped in some way.
Cambodia
I am far from being so enthusiastic.
There is increasing violence.
This is the solution to the problem.
There is widespread concern.
Attack on a train in Angola
Work has started within the Council.
I regard such methods as inadmissible.
Mr Wurtz, you were not present.
This is not true.
That is why what was said...
(The President cut the speaker off)
The debate is closed.
Anti-personnel mines
. B5-0599/2001 by Mrs Bonino et al
We can understand that.
Mr President, what are we doing?
There is no doubt about that.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Drought in Central America
on the drought in Central America.
I am sure this will be corrected.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Mountain farming
Many mountains straddle frontiers.
Mr President, Mr Ebner, well done!
A good report.
It only focuses on this aspect.
Britain is much the poorer for that.
The debate is closed
Basic education in developing countries
They are set and they are endless.
Their learning situation is terrible.
It is only 1% of the total.
Let me just touch on one or two issues.
The impact of HIV is enormous.
Meeting the targets looks difficult.
It is a price worth paying.
The report of Mrs Kinnock is excellent.
That education must be free.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately.

Our world will never be the same again.
(Loud applause)
That was a grave error.
But, above all, it is insufficient.
Today, we must review this issue.
That remains to be seen.
(The sitting was closed at 6.10 p.m.)

Are there any comments?
Yes, Mr Swoboda, of course.

Tribute
Statement by the President
Thank you in advance.
Welcome
Combating terrorism
(Applause)
Terrorism is not a recent phenomenon.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
The time for words is now past!
We must act as Europeans.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
I welcome these responsible words.
This is an opportunity to be seized.
We must be aware of this.
I shall not elaborate any further.
Is this request not somewhat mistimed?
I do not agree.
I believe that they are right.
We now have globalisation of terrorism.
Everyone is vulnerable.
That is the challenge.
This was called for back at Amsterdam.
(The President cut the speaker off)
It has one, of course.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Terrorism creates a state of mind.
The EU is perceived as pro-Arab.
I regret this.
We should be pro-democracy.
Will Europe support us?
That was really most difficult.
Tampere was two years ago.
The world economy is in bad shape.
Luckily, we have the euro.
Dialogue is the first step.
Such is the demand of the moment.
Their hunger is called power.
Their weapons are fear and destruction.
Because we owe a debt to all of them.
It has a common objective and method.
They have never wanted peace.
Allow me to describe it as such.
We must keep an eye on this situation.
The situation can, of course, change.
Europe does not have the means.
There must be no more of this.
I have to say, I doubt it.

Future of cohesion policy
This is not solely a question of money.
We know that it is an important issue.
They are very necessary.
Too true!
Where are we in real terms? At 1.06%.
It is also because of Parliament...
(The President cut the speaker off)
This was demonstrably false.
How can it be done?
That would be consistent.
Enlargement is a great challenge.
It is one of solidarity.
Let us not forget this fact.
This goes without saying.
This is a problem.
I listened to it very carefully.
I think they are particularly unfair.
Three years beforehand!
I have shown transparency.
You talked about fraud.
Personally, I am extremely strict.
There are probably errors.
There are probably delays.
There are often irregularities.
I agree.
I am open to this type of criticism.
It is accepted by all Member States.
The debate is closed.
There was even a visible decrease.
These figures are extremely worrying.
.
There is no ambiguity in this respect.
But we are not the Court of Auditors.
And this is true in all respects.
It is a question worth asking.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Female genital mutilation
The first is the right of asylum.
That is most important.
Here the vote was unanimous.
Thank you very much, Mr Turco.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
More support must be given.
The EU is helping with DAPHNE.
Yet this is just a drop in the ocean.
I believe that to be appropriate.
The same applies to refugee policy.
This is a difficult, thorny problem.
What can the European Union do?
First, proposals and legislation.
The question of asylum.
The debate is closed.
Equal pay for work of equal value

Perhaps we should begin with ourselves.
I thought it was very interesting.
Let me draw attention to three points.
Personally, I do not think so at all.
So what can we do there?
That is unacceptable.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The debate is closed.
Harassment in the work place
What do we need to do?
Where does legislation come in?
Well done.
What can we do?
I prefer this type of solution.
Bullying causes all these problems.
It must be respected and protected' .
The real figure is far higher.
Yet it is a serious workplace problem.

The debate is closed.
Air pollution
I would like to thank her too.
That is, in fact, too late.
I thank the Swedish Presidency.
The point I want to make is this.
That is ridiculous.
It is not going to be easy.
There is a long time scale.
In fact the opposite is true.
This is a short-sighted view.
The joint debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
Mr Santini, that will be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
We will put forward your suggestion.
Mr bin Laden has a London bank account.
This is one small part of that process.
Nor does it cover terrorist acts.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
External borders and Schengen
I should like to list three.
That was the message.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Refugee status in Member States
Let me explain briefly what I mean.
I appeal to you yet again!
I know this is a difficult issue.
I also know this is a sensitive issue.
Welcome
That is not want we want either.
We are in absolute agreement on this.
They are asking to be accepted here.
Thank you for your report.
This ignores the reality.
Our objectives are the same.
Thank you, Madam President.
So this cycle is now complete.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
You are absolutely right.

(Applause from the GUE/NGL Group)
(Applause)
It is this that I ask of you.
(Applause from the PSE Group)
Agenda
Secondly, the political issue.
(Parliament gave its assent)
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
The others were replaced.
Relating to Thursday:
(Applause from the ELDR Group)
That is my point of order.
Let me first congratulate you on it.
(Interruption by Mr Schultz)
Mr Schultz, I did not interrupt you.
Why are you getting so het up?
The left-wing democrats are in trouble.
Madam President, on a point of order.
This is a very serious matter.
Thank you, Mrs Wallstr√∂m.
There is a serious matter.
The situation is extremely grave.
It is a real tragedy.
Let me now come to the follow-up.
We must improve how the system works.
We often talk of 'zero risk' .
What you said is important.
This was insufficient.
We need political measures.
The entire situation has changed.
And the countries must accept it.
What happened there is unimaginable.
There is no safety programme in place.
We must have a risk prevention policy.
It would appear not.
Indeed, Never again!
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Environmental noise
The tyre directive is a case in point.
But that is not enough.
So what is it about?
It is about measuring noise.
The same applies to the action plans.
Information is another point.
We think this is very important.
I suspect that made a hell of a din.
That may be the case.
A separate problem is aircraft noise.
I do not think so.
I agree with Mr Florenz.
Do we compete in terms of geography?
Indeed it is to be welcomed.
I would like to mention another point.
We have taken note of this.
The debate is closed.
What is this compromise about?
I do not like this system.
This system should not be supported.
If so, they should think again.
It has made the investment.
But is that not what we want overall?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Expiry of ECSC Treaty
I must say, they really have a nerve!
Back to the matter in hand.
This really is a mistake.
We must be clear about that.
I think it is worth mentioning this.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.55 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
This is essential.
So what is needed?
Joint regulation?
I am very much in favour of that.
Can people be held to account?
That is not our idea of democracy.
Clarity always remains condition No 1.
We count on you, Mr Prodi.
We ought to look at that point.
I am sorry that Mr Farage has left.
It certainly does that.
Mr President, I have three points.
That is where we should all start.
The Commission has to face this.
I have a problem with this wording.
Your report talks about leadership.
Yet that is what we need.
(Applause)
We want to listen to citizens.
But what if it were not very good?
That is a very welcome development.
This, to me, is a step forward.
Thank you very much, Mr Prodi.
Thank you very much, Mr Prodi!
Asylum and immigration

How will this make the system better?
I commend the report to Parliament.
Let us look at the three groups first.
What are the core issues in my report?
But they do need support.
Why is that?
Let me explain.
I have a clear answer to that: no!
We also need consistency.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That goes without saying.
This is appealing and necessary.
(Applause from the right)
Some revision is needed here.

(The President cut the speaker off)
We do not accept this.
(Applause from the right)
I am not so sure.
It is not the same.
How is this to be interpreted?
This is no longer acceptable.
I would now like to make three points.
Article 23 could not be clearer.
But the world has moved on.
The review is now underway.
(Applause)
We shall now proceed to the vote.
VOTE
Before the vote:
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
Before the final vote:
I ask you to vote in favour of it.
.
Arms exports
Only then will it be truly effective.
This is completely unacceptable.
Lastly, the candidate countries.
That must be changed.
What is a terrorist?
That is not justified.
It is never justified.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
But it is actually true.
I should like to make one other point.
We understand the difficulties.
We, as Europe, must do more.
We cannot cross the borders.
UNHCR and WFP are in the same boat.
We will need to take action in Iran.
We will need to do this as Europe.
They are dallying and dithering.
You are dividing the world into two.
We have always supported NGOs.
We must do all we can to help.
What is that relationship not?
Let us be clear about that too.
Allow me to quote three examples.
That is not acceptable.
My concern is the political response.
And what do we do?
This is my urgent plea.
The cancer of terrorism.
When will we learn that is our war too?
But what is being done in comparison?
Let us be firm and decisive.
They were all there on 11 September.
I had to cancel the trip.
Now, as I said, the situation is worse.
Winter is approaching.
That is how it must be.
So this is more than just food aid.
Now our response has to go beyond this.
We will be asking for more money.
This is not the problem.
The red tape here is minimal.
Protection was mentioned.
Here we are in a terrible dilemma.
But this is extremely difficult.
This is the line to take.
Thank you for your patience.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
We thank you for presenting it now.
Those are my two questions.
That was my first question.
This is a fundamental issue.
Mr Ripoll therefore has the floor.
So where did you get that 10% from?
Secondly, the environmental impact.
Mr President, many thanks to Mr Varela.
There is no railway.
We are talking about high figures.
That concludes this item on the agenda.
Question Time (Commission)
Mr Vitorino represents the Commission.
Part I
Question No 27 by (H-0700/01):
Question No 28 by (H-0730/01):
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you.
.
Question 29 by (H-0737/01):

A very good afternoon, Mr Bolkestein.
Part II
Questions to Commissioner Bolkestein
Question No 30 by (H-0707/01):
Question No 32 by (H-0750/01):
But we are in the European Parliament.
Mr President, my answer is as follows.
We know we can count on you.
Question No 35 by (H-0695/01):
The quote is directly from him.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
It is a disgrace.
Question No 43 by (H-0710/01):
Question No 47 by (H-0746/01):


Question No 48 by (H-0747/01):
That concludes Question Time.

That was what was achieved at Durban.
Of course, we cannot forget the past.

What lessons can we learn from this?
That requires a united front.
That is something to celebrate.
That success was realised.
Words have meaning.
Who was hijacking whom?
Why?
For what purpose?
No, certainly not.
That is regrettable, of course.
Durban may be a start.
This was a perfidious strategy.
So let us not allow it to happen!
Let us be an example.
These developments are most worrying.
What, then, should have been discussed?
We reject this pointless exercise.
I think that it was perfectly natural.
The debate is closed.
I see a good number of familiar faces.
I fully understand and appreciate that.
The buses are only part of it.
What about the principles?
It will go through tomorrow.
So we will not be obstructing it.
That is absolutely the right approach.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
GALILEO
That can surely not be the intention.
Why, then, is GALILEO vital for Europe?
There is not only good in the world.
The European Union is a major power.
We must be aware of this situation.
First of all, the management structure.
There must be a balance.
A report has been drawn up.
That too took up a lot of time.
Let me start with the technology.
That is absolutely not the case.
GPS is a similar system.
No problem whatsoever.
That is 13%.
I have no doubts about that.
Technical progress is ever more rapid.
Thank you, Mrs De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
It is a small part of what is needed.
Thank you, Mrs De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
That is why we should use benchmarking.
Innovation is the key to this.
Is that the kind of innovation we mean?
Or do we not need to define innovation?
And how will we get there?
Do you know, Commissioner?
Where are we heading?
Questions on a good report.

I will focus on the productivity gap.
But change is important and positive.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Exhaustion of trade mark rights
There is something wrong there.
For example, you order 'a Siemens' .
However, the matter cannot rest here.
Nevertheless I salute him.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)
Announcement by the President
I would like to thank Mr Michel.
This must be repeated again and again!
We now need more of Europe.
We need to cooperate with Russia.

We support what you have said.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause from the left)
That would certainly be one answer.
But let me be clear about one point.
We must all work together.
They cost us dear.
There are, in my view, two main risks.
That is an aspect we must bear in mind.
The other issue is the Arab world.
But these are all secondary issues.
That brings me to my main point.
All this is not pure chance.
Everyone knows that.
Obviously you will all say 'no' .
(The President cut the speaker off)
People are shocked.
We hold to our treaty commitments.
Europe has been there.
Europe has been at war.
His name is Massoud" .
We are united in our fate.
Several Members raised this matter.
It must not be exponential.
I believe we have to remember that.
We would be more radical.
I can do no more.
Those are the ideas now on the table.
Of course, I agree with him.
You all know my views on this.
We will get there in the end.
This was accepted.
I heard them clearly.
Mr President, war is not the answer.
It is the end that justifies the means.
These remarks, then, must be withdrawn.
But, now what?
That is obvious.
But how is it to do so?
The question is how do we respond?
Let us not disappoint them any longer.
I wish you the best of luck in Ghent.
This is also relevant to enlargement.
They must be given their place.
That is not what I want.
Speaking of that convention...
I will come to a close soon.
(Applause)
Mr President, my card has disappeared.
The debate is closed.
This is not a new thing, though.
Announcement by the President
Are there any objections?
We shall now proceed to the votes.
VOTE
Are there any objections?
Hence the three amendments I tabled.
They seem to worry the rapporteur.
Congratulations to all of you.
de Roo report (A5-0296/2001)
So evaluation comes before management.
.
.
Evans Robert J.E. report (A5-0304/2001)
How many applications are unfounded?
Probably nine out of ten.
It allows the problem to be minimised.
In fact it is immense.
All this is totally ill-timed.

.
However, it is still a wish list.
.
Pirker report (A5-0305/2001)
I voted against this report.
It sends out the wrong signals.
However, there are negative aspects.
(The President cut the speaker off)
.
to combat human trafficking gangs;
This is not our opinion either.
.
So what are its solutions?
We are critical of parts of the report.
Titley report (A5-0309/2001)
.
.
.
Langenhagen report (A5-0288/2001)
.
.
There are plenty of reasons for this.
R√ºbig report (A5-0234/2001)
Naturally I support these proposals.
.
Mayer report (A5-0311/2001)

.
.
That concludes voting time.
Welcome
(Applause)

Secondly, the financing of terrorism.
That was the first demand.
These pillars must not be shaken.
Why can they not agree to that?
Why not just agree to it then?
You spoke about that, Commissioner.
Why not agree to that?
Why can they not agree to that?
But in reality they do not.
We must also respond in the short term.
I think it is time we recognise this.
We want reform.
We have consistently pointed this out.
That would be truly paradoxical!
It is no good waiting.
There is no denying that.
However, that is not the issue.
Are we forecasting a slump, yes or no?
Some say, wait and see what happens.
I fail to understand why.
We have no scientific answer.
We are dogmatic.
The reverse is also true.
Obviously, we all want to grow.
This is my first point.
That cannot work.
This is the ninth rate cut this year.
That is our right.
And he is right.
I think he is very much mistaken.
Let us turn those tools against them.
That is not at all the case.
I do not believe it would.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Television without frontiers
That is not a healthy situation.
But what has happened since then?
We should offer them a warm welcome.
We agree with you.
This process is already under way.
The process will continue next year.
Plans are afoot for further workshops.
The directive has a much wider scope.
Thank you very much, Mrs Reding.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0689/01):
Are any figures available on this?
Question No 2 by (H-0690/01):
Question No 3 by (H-0691/01):
Efforts are under way.
Yes!
That is clearly the case here.
Thank you very much, Mr Bautista Ojeda.
Question No 6 by (H-0699/01):
What has the Council done about this?
Question No 7 by (H-0705/01):
Thank you for your reply.
That does not answer my question.
How will that person later be located?
That is a matter for the Member State.
Question No 8 by (H-0715/01):
I believe that it refers to Finland.
I am sorry I missed that one.
I can only repeat what I said.
Question No 9 by (H-0717/01):
What progress is expected to be made?
Question No 10 by (H-0719/01):
(Protests from Mr Andrews)
That is rather a personal point.
Question No 11 by (H-0720/01):
Question No 12 by (H-0724/01):
You have rectified the situation.
Question No 13 by (H-0721/01):
Where is that report?
Question No 14 by (H-0722/01):
Forgive me for using an economic term.
Was this pure coincidence?
I have accepted your question.
There is no problem.
Two other Members also wanted to speak.
We usually reply question by question.
Question No 16 by (H-0727/01):
What measures does it intend to take?
It is a disgrace, an absolute disgrace!
But that is by the by.
I have been very clear in my answers.
We are doing our homework.
Why?
What does this mean?
However, you know that too.
That is not what is at stake here!
Hence the amendments we have tabled.
No, it certainly is not!
We must look to the future.
I wish to focus on two matters.
This is a key element of our model.
The same can be said of the UMTSs.
I believe that is the complete list.
It was a slightly hectic month.
It was not a matter of content.
I did the same in my report.
The debate is closed.
Competition policy (2000)
There are plenty of examples.
So we could go on.
Thank you very much, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
E-commerce and financial services
There is a lot still to do.
Of course, there are real difficulties.
This is a very good report.
The Internet is growing in importance.
Our target is the year 2005.
I still have myself.
I commend this report to the House.
I have one comment to make.
Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
Internal market strategy for services
Both of us have emphasised that here.
Now to my own report, however.
We should not rule any instrument out.
We will need further harmonisation.
Again, these provisions will help.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
What is this report about?
We also need comparability of data.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
I shall not abuse the Rule.
The matter is now closed.
General product safety
I congratulate the rapporteur.
The market cannot be regulated.
I fully support this objective.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
This is the reality!
So there is a mistake in paragraph 14.
These are minor changes.
Many ambiguities still remain, however.
What does this mean in specific terms?
At present, they are not available.
Some, like mine, do not give 0.25%.
And what is the EU doing?
Yet this is still the crucial issue.
And we do not want that.
That is the scene confronting us.
That is a human disaster.
TB too, of course, is a killer.
Some day we will realise this.
The drug companies are our partners.
They will not say.
They will not commit themselves.
They just will not answer.
It was publicly-funded research.
(Applause from the left)
Why is there not a similar response?
This is a major problem.
That warning has to be taken seriously.
All this work is taking place.
This is progressing quite well.
I thank the rapporteur, Mr Khanbai.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at noon.
VOTE
Before the vote on recital H
I request your acceptance.
I will not partake in the vote today.
If so, I invite them to do so now.
I hope Members will support this.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
It is a very important matter.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
I am sorry, that is the rule.
Yes, it is in Rule 137:
International terrorism (C5-0455/2001)
We cannot be neutral against terror.
Women in particular have suffered.
And who has the burden of proof?
.
.
Japan is now experiencing a recession.
Hieronymi Report (A5-0286/2001)
Ber√®s Report (A5-0307/2001)
I fully support this objective.
Paragraph 2:
Recital B:
The reasons for this are no mystery.
Who should pay?
.
Peijs report (A5-0306/2001)
.
Longo report (A5-0299/2001)

Huhne report (A5-0301/2001)

Berger report (A5-0310/2001)

Khanbai report (A5-0263/2001)

TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Thirdly, this is a multiethnic state.
Its status must be enhanced.
It includes those who want it.
Macedonia is a state.
Obviously, there are reasons for this.
That must not happen.
We say and we hope that it did.
How were the numbers calculated?
We hope they will make progress.
I regard Macedonia as our partner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
It is a policy of autosuggestion.
I commend this motion to the House.
The situation there is disastrous.
We met the people there.
We met the relief workers.
The sewers in the basement are broken.
The stench there is unbearable.
They infect other people around them.
East Timor
Today, however, is a joyous occasion.
We must continue to help East Timor.
Colombia
The violence also affects us closely.
This is a very high figure.
Let me turn to East Timor.
This process seems to be well on track.
The emergency phase is over.
I would say that so far, so good.
Finally, I turn to Colombia.
EUR 10 m are being spent this year.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Southern Caucasia
Is it still meeting?
Even that is not clear.
That would be unacceptable.
This is an impossible job.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Political situation in Myanmar (Burma)
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Patenting of human genes
We owe this to the women affected.
Thank you very much, Mr Purvis.
It has a Board of Appeal.
That is a significant difference.
What Mr Rothley says is also incorrect.
I just wanted to clarify that point.
Number one.
Thank you very much, Mrs Breyer.
I fully endorse its position.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

That is not correct.
This is new and should be highlighted.
Let me turn to trade.
So let me be very clear here.
The debate is closed.
VOTE
Adjournment of the session

Resumption of the session
Announcement by the President
Agenda
(Parliament gave its assent)
President.
Thank you, Mr Borghezio.
(Applause from the Greens/ALE Group)
This is completely unacceptable.
Thank you, Madam President.
Madam President, Africa also exists.
I am glad that is the final result.
I deeply regret that it took so long.
I shall gladly do so, Mr Onesta.
Mr Ibragimov has begun to eat again.
Please keep reporting to Parliament.
In my view, these are wise comments.
I want clarity on this.
These include ground-to-air missiles.
I expect it to be circulated.
This is very serious.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Briefly, about aviation.
This was the background to what I said.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
European judicial area/SIS II
I can only emphatically support that.
Less is sometimes more.
Thank you, Mr von Boetticher.
It must be financed from our budget.
We must take account of this.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This gives me great pleasure.
Our committee was extremely clear.
It is not correct.
I regret this.
The debate is closed.
The Council adopted the same policy.
May we continue along that route!
I commend the directive to the House.
Why?
Now I come to the amendments tabled.
That is possible in the United States.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed
International monetary system
The report points that out.
Because it cannot be regulated.
By that means, growth can be produced.
That has already been said.
Third, we begin at home.
So how do we respond?
What can we do?
How can we improve the situation?
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.47 p.m.)
(Applause)
Decision on urgent procedure
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
That is what we are voting on today.

Amendments Nos 1-3 I accept in full.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Informing and consulting employees

That is subsidiarity.
This means partnership.
Examples of these are:
This is my question.
The responsibilities work both ways.
Voluntary agreements are not enough.
So, what exactly is the problem?
(Applause from the Left)
This was timely and also necessary.
Problems do not arise.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
and
But the points have been set.
How are we to balance the equation?
Equality is an investment.
They are pursuing their own policy.
This was true prior to 11 September.
But how?
His famous steady hand is trembling.
Modernisation really does have winners.
The second point is best practices.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
I will go through a couple of them.
We have been waiting for many years.
Amendment No 2 is crucial.
That is simply not the case, however.
That, I think, is wrong.
Let me be clear.
I accept Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 7.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
Therefore a balance has to be struck.

2002 budget
Thank you, Mr Costa Neves.
Mrs Buitenweg has the floor.
I wonder about that.
Who will pay for this?
The key word here is 'wine' .
That cannot be what you meant.
It has 189 established posts.
Indeed, it is, of course, justified.
Together, we managed it.
That shows what current demands are.
A large amount will become available.
I know we are going to need this money.
Why do I urge this?
.
We must make changes here.
We know something must be done.
That is needed.
We must, though, face reality.
This is not on!
It is absolutely not on!
Take your courage in both hands!
Chapter A-30 again caused problems.
I congratulate the rapporteurs.
Their work is never easy.
Where are we?
It is stuck in the Council.
I hope you will take that on board.
My group supports this goal.
Heading 4 is difficult.
It must be dissolved.
This could be partly acceptable.
There is more.
The same goes for Europol and Eurojust.
We will accord them high honour for it.
We will introduce innovation.
We must not stand on old rights.
There is room for progress here.
Thank you very much for your attention.
(Applause)
I will start with the first heading.
We can look into insurance systems.
What are they about?
I would be much obliged.
We shall see in December what happens.
The first comment concerns the RAL.
I strongly deny what James Elles said.
The cooperation has been really good.
This does not hold water.
We want to rescue aid to the Balkans.
Go on, blame the citizens!
Such is inflation!
Let me now address one further point.

We have Kosovo: we have to help Kosovo.
We have Serbia: we have to help Serbia.
And what price do we pay?
We still have problems in the Balkans.
But we have to make cuts.
Why?
Why is that not budgeted for?
It should have done so.
We only made legitimate requests.
Thank you very much, Mr Deprez.
Nothing will stop when we reach 2004.
Everything must continue.
That seems extremely important to me.
It can be done another way.
But we must always hope.
They simply exist.
That seems to be all that matters.
I would ask her to look at them.
He had asked me to wait for it.
Many thanks!

ESF (2000 - 2006)
Thank you very much.

This was announced in February 2001.
The first call was a complete success.
The debate is closed.
It contains a number of major failings.
What will happen if we are?
You spoke for more than two minutes.
That is our first achievement.
But that is what we expect.
That is unfortunately not the case.

Thank you.

6th, 7th and 8th EDF discharge for 1999
That is the problem in a nutshell.
It will be a pivotal factor.

Thank you very much.
We grilled them.
We need to continue to do this.
It has to be tackled with realism.
This is serious.
This should not be forgotten.
I want to make that perfectly clear.
We cannot act alone.
The debate is closed.

I am sure that cannot be right.

What is our intention?
Modifications are inevitable.
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.09 p.m.)
Thank you for your comments.
They were extremely courteous.
You are on your own.
Thank you, Mr Santini.

Secondly, our programme.
Thirdly, our instruments.
(Loud applause)
(Applause)
Our group supports it unreservedly.
(Applause)
(Applause)
The Union needs economic leadership.
I appreciate the enormous difficulties.
I very much welcome that.
Does that invitation extend to Turkey?
What is our objective?
We must all be on the watch for that.
We want to ensure that this is done.
No, Europe is not absent!
In fact, Ghent was a ghost town.
We are facing an economic crisis.
We cannot afford failure at Laeken.
As if it legitimised anything!
This distinction is essential.
That is not at issue at all.
We have money.
We have trade.
We have the UN.
We have resources in that region.
We can be of real significance there.
That is my first plea.
My second plea concerns Afghanistan.
History has taught us that.
It is the only way to catch Bin Laden.
You did not get sidetracked in Ghent.

I welcome this.
What is the European Union' s role?
We need capacity to act as a Community.
A joint vision and a joint approach.
Again, we have a joint stance.
Now this no longer holds true.
But when will this come about?
It is obvious.
The convention is a fact.
The answer is very simple.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Thank you, President Prodi.
I apologise for this.

The second paragraph is Paragraph 19.
Changes must be made here.
What is that?
It is about time!
The debate is closed.
All this slows down the process.

I would like to briefly explain this.

That is a disaster.
We support a new trade round.
Doha will not be Seattle, however.
The social issue is symbolic.
Things are looking quite bad.
It is right to take small steps.
Open trade - yes, but only with rules.
Secondly, environmental standards.
The EU faces charges of protectionism.
This is a deal-breaker for us.
I know you will be tough on our behalf.
Good luck Commissioner.
It will not be an easy task.
However, everything bodes well.
It is significant in itself.
There will indeed be some of that.
This is how our democracy works.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
International trade
We propose going further, however.
It is a tool for dismantling democracy.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I hope we will seize it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
We need to try to change that emphasis.
We need strategic lift.
They will put it to the test.
Take countries such as Ukraine.
What should this policy be?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Turkey
For me this is a test case.
It is a very good report.
Some people think that it is too soft.
The final problem is Cyprus.
Turkey simply has not realised this.
So there is no problem.
I do not think that that helps it.
I think we should be clear, however.
There is a single exception.
But I will add something else.
My second comment concerns Cyprus.
Is this a genuine reform?
I would answer, no.
The time is right for sweeping reforms.
That is its basic message.
That is a fact.
(The President cut the speaker off)
It spared me somewhat.
I want to see a pluralistic Europe.
Yes, the Kurdish people.
This is the case with the Kurds.
There can only be complete abolition.

It took me 23 hours to get home.

We may as well be talking to Siberia.
Madam President, on a point of order.
Public access to Parliament documents
.
Mr President, what is transparency?
Transparency is definitely one of them.
It represents an improvement.
I hope that will be accepted.
Parliaments must be transparent.
The media need to help in this as well.

Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The reasons for this escape me.
I have the report right here.
The second issue is efficiency.
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
The debate is closed.
Europol - joint investigation teams
and

rapporteur.
There is one further point.
Is that so?
Are you from the Council?
We don' t know!
Thank you, Mr Cappato.
Europol is not operational.
They are also aware of this need.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.

Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

Why?
It is not true.
I support the opt-out on two grounds.
It is wrong and ill-informed.
That is where the spam is coming from.
We have not hurried this decision.
That is completely illogical.
We should be thinking about the future.
Technology is changing rapidly.
I fully agree.
Unfortunately that is no longer true.
That is a technological fact.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
European films
That, then, is possible.
Again, congratulations!

That is wonderful.
It is at this hurdle that we fall.
There are no independent producers.
These are just some observations.
That is why this is so urgent.
The problems are related.

Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Protection of animals during transport
First of all, there is supervision.
My group supports this report.
This is long overdue.
They must be taken to court and fined.
There is no good reason for doing this.
This can and should be avoided.
Presumably, it is economic madness.
That is absurd!
We must police and enforce this fully.
Hard cases make bad law.
That is, however, not the case.
This is not the kind of Europe we want!
I fully agree.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 9.40 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
What are we going to do then?
We are talking about social measures.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
That concludes the vote.
The results are striking.
Let me finally add one little word.
(Applause)
One example is in the personnel field.
So once again, many thanks.
Heads of stock continue be overstated.
It is on the right track.
That has not been done to date.
I have one comment to make on the DAS.
Can we draw clear conclusions from it?
No, not really.
We can already detect some improvement.
However, this is still not enough.
It cannot be said often enough.
My third point is a comment about OLAF.
That was a real compliment.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Thank you, Mr. Blak.
I wish you every success in that.
That concludes this item.
Money laundering
Mr President, I represent a minority.
That is going too far.
That is why I am voting against this.
I certainly cannot vote for that.
You will be stopped there.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
What is it about?
We should welcome that opportunity.
The difficulty relates to subsidiarity.
That is one point.
That will be very difficult.
What is that?
The debate is closed.
This action was ultimately successful.
This is extremely serious.
Services of general interest in Europe
Why are we concerned with this area?
What does this cover?
A balanced programme needs leeway.
Yes, I believe that we need safeguards.
Let me mention only ambulance services.
We reject this decisively.
What falls at this arbitrary threshold?
When is intra-Community trade affected?
(The President cut the speaker off)
And there can be no other approach.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you Commissioner Bolkestein.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote
Thank you Mr Caveri.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I therefore want to reiterate this.
I cannot do anything about it either.
Lehne report (A5-0380/2001)
Maij-Weggen report (A5-0349/2001)
'What documents?' I asked her.
'Next time round' I told her.
.
Carnero Gonz√°lez report (A5-0346/2001)
Cappato report (A-0374/2001)
'We want to meet him!
This is the sort of privacy we want!'
'Of course,' I told them.

Turco report (A5-0370/2001)
We do not support these amendments.

Kirkhope report (A-0369/2001)

Maat report (A5-0347/2001)
.
(NL) Animals are not products.
.
.
Langen report (A5-0361/2001)
.
.

We came to a consensus.
The citizen will see through this.
That is our common objective.
What, then, is the position?
That is the objective we have set.
That is what we are doing.
I have several reasons for this view.
I do not think anyone can deny this.
Quite the reverse, in fact.
It must be carried out in stages.
Many thanks, Mr President.
For us, it is about safety.
The initiative states that.
Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
Market access to port services
Granted, that is not exactly easy.
Pilot services are another issue.
We must increase competition at ports.
Why?
So that is the first problem.
Thank you.
I would like to make several points:
Competition is one thing.
I hope the House rejects it tomorrow.
I am in favour of self-financed ports.
I will not support these amendments.
These professions are fairly similar.
This is why Amendment 52 is dangerous.
I am sorry but this is an absurd idea.
'Eurosclerosis' hits the poor hardest.

Enlargement
(Loud applause)
Why is this so?
Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
Can you say something more about that?
We abide fully by what we agreed.
Our response is quite clear.
This monitoring is going on constantly.
There are positive things in it.
So much is well known.
That is the good I have to report.
They touch on nothing else.
Let me say it clearly: none of them.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I have tried to act for the best.
If I was wrong, I apologise.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Question Time (Commission)
Part I
Question No 28 by (H-0857/01):
Question No 29 by (H-0849/01):
This is a very serious matter.
Have you looked at that study?
Clearly, that may be inappropriate.
But can you not do something?
Do you believe in upholding them?
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.

I also have three children.
Questions to Commissioner Reding
Question No 31 by (H-0772/01):
Question No 32 by (H-0776/01):
We have accepted this division.
We are running a little late.
I would like you to bear this in mind.
Another point is research.

Thank you very much, Mrs Reding.
Questions to Mr Liikanen
Question No 34 by (H-0786/01):
Question No 36 by (H-0801/01).
That is why I tabled the question.
I will make two comments.
Question No 37 by (H-0800/01):
Question No 38 by (H-0821/01):
Is this view correct?
We have already produced a proposal.
Questions to Mr Vitorino
Question No 41 by (H-0782/01):
Question No 42 by (H-0792/01):
That was my question.
Question No 43 by (H-0794/01):
I am very happy to reply.
Security of energy supply
However let us be realistic,.
It seems obvious but needs repeating.
Thank you again.
The reasons are well known.
There are other areas as well.
Mr Chichester mentioned coal.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Mr Turmes, on a point of order.
The debate is closed.
Chemicals strategy
It is long overdue.
But that was a few months ago.
This is only a White Paper.
That is why a change is needed.
I cannot understand it.
Even they should be registered.
That is not, however, going to happen.
However they can also be bad for you.
They could be at risk.
We should prioritise areas for action.
It must be verifiable.
So we will have to look into that.
Who ascertains something like that?
That is a fact.
That obviously has to change.
That is a basic error in the system.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

My group is happy to support it.
Legislating now would be a mistake.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Packaging and packaging waste
We really need to discuss packaging.
It is possible.
Is there not a multitude of loopholes?
I do not believe so.
Let me make clear that I regret that.
That did not happen.
Insurance mediation
They are therefore rejected.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at midnight.)
Are there any comments?
There is no doubt about that.

We might or we might not.
I think the first title was better.
I would like to finish on this point.
We worked well together.
Agriculture is also more involved.
It will be available in any case.
Let us build on their past success.
We have worked very well together.
That is very long term.
It will also use scientific resources.
That must be the basic principle.
That could also lead to a brain drain.
They aim to prevent this.
Has the Commission looked into this?
Two points cause me concern.
The same applies to preparation funds.
Amendment No 265 concerns this matter.
It is not their priority.
I commend it to the Parliament.
My third observation is on fusion.
Sooner or later it will overcome.
We have facilities.
I would like to raise two issues.
Paper does not blush, however.
How will we achieve these goals?
That is the first point.
It is cannibalism.
The debate is closed.
EU/Latin America relations
Commissioner.
I shall certainly do my best.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkenstein.
I am, naturally, referring to Cuba.
Welcome
These meetings began in 1996.
Thank you, Mr Salafranca.
Shipbuilding
South Korea did not honour it.
South Korea did not respond.
This is the issue today.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote
The next item is the vote.
Procedure without debate:
(Laughter and applause)
We aim to please.
President.
(Loud applause)
Before the vote on Amendment No 47:
(Laughter and applause)
Amendment No 47 falls.
Before the vote:
President.
(Sustained applause)
Thank you for that clarification.
Do you agree, Mr Caudron?
He is right about that minor addition.
Thank you.
That is outdated wording.
I am not referring to Paragraph 4.
At least I am clear now.
It says: 'a minimum of 3%' .
That is very clear.
Alright, 'new or improved' .
President.
That concludes the vote.

Report Caudron (A5-0355/2001):
International situation
We call on you to take this action.
That is my first point.
Police cooperation is improving.
We must continue in that vein.
That must be our response.
But it is there.
So there is a great need for urgency.
I have two final comments.
One concerns the Middle East.
If so, what are they?
But what justice are we talking about?
What balance are we talking about?
No, enough of that!
Things are not like that.
That is a total package.
Therefore I cannot give it.
We need to act as a community.
I can only confirm it.
Thank you, Mr Busquin.
The debate is closed.
I hope it is a hypothetical question.
Has the Council considered this?
We have not succeeded.
We have made a mistake.
The third problem is the most crucial.
It is wrong to point to the USA alone.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Shipbuilding (continuation)
The Commission sees no problems.
There, I disagree.
That is incorrect.
Korea is mentioned specifically, then.
I come from Sweden.
I will quote one example.
What have we done so far?
I deeply regret that this is happening.
We must give them the floor.
Question Time (Council)
The second question has been withdrawn.
Question No 3 by (H-0778/01):
My question relates to this issue.
Question No 4 by (H-0781/01):
I confirm what I just said.
Question No 6 by (H-0784/01):
How can these two things be reconciled?
Question No 7 by (H-0788/01):
Question No 8 by (H-0791/01):
Question No 9 by (H-0795/01):
Question No 11 by (H-0825/01):
Are they entitled to political asylum?
Question No 12 by (H-0797/01):
Kabul has fallen.
The Taliban regime is fleeing.
Afghanistan faces a new future.
Are they still there in Kabul?
Have they been taken to Kandahar?
Can we rescue them?
Question No 14 by (H-0806/01):
That goes without saying.
A new opening exists.
Question No 15 by (H-0807/01):

Question No 16 by (H-0810/01):

Question No 17 by (H-0814/01):


Mr President, on a point of order.
Question No 19 by (H-0824/01):
Perhaps they can find it out now.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Question No 21 by (H-0820/01):
Question No 23 by (H-0838/01):
Cross-border payments in euro
This issue is different.
On 1 January we will get the euro.
However, we are waiting on the banks.
The ball is in their court.
We need to think of them.
I strongly reject Mr Maaten's proposal.
We should clarify this too.
I remember this well.
That is an important fact.
We can thus accept that amendment.
Many thanks, Mr President.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
, rapporteur.
That is the first mistake.
How do we know it will?
Because we have statistics.
The second point concerns Article 3(1).
We believe that this is wrong.
.
Is that what we want to achieve?
How clever of us!
That was a mistake on their part.
It is like no other product.
Well, I have some here.
That is the Commission's opinion too.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
European Council in spring 2002
I am not optimistic.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
That is for the sceptics.
I therefore congratulate them.
What is at stake here?
All other rules should be maintained.
I turn to Amendments Nos 14 and 15.
Then there is Amendment No 16.
Then there is Amendment No 17.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
Many thanks.
Thank you!
(The Minutes were approved).
Their description was most interesting.
Others are due to a fall in demand.
Airlines have gone bankrupt.
We need action now.
And what did we do?
That is not enough.
We need direct action now.
If that is so, then I condemn it.
Secondly, the cause.
Everyone knows that in my country.
One thing is clear to me.
We must opt for a European approach.
We must adopt a European approach.
This cannot work.
We have to take that into account.
That may well create more jobs.
That is unacceptable.
That is point one.
This time is no exception.
What has it done?
I condemn it for that.
Yes, there is aid in various forms.
There have been responses.
The law on state aid is not the Koran.
What tool do we have at European level?
Of course not.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Combating social exclusion
We have urgent challenges to meet.
It has proved its worth in this area.
This involvement is critical.
So what does this tool do?
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Announcement by the President
Will that now be at around 3.30 p.m.?
Madam President, on a point of order.
I saw a piece of baggage on a chair.
He was extremely arrogant and annoyed.
He took his bag and marched away.
He said that he knew Mrs Muscardini.

They suffer multi-discrimination.
This must change.
We still have much to do, however.
We need more equality in everyday life.

Future of the European Union
The next item is the joint debate on:
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
This is a serious warning.

Let me return to a number of issues.
That is the real task.
I very much doubt it.
This method is the Convention.
This is not true.
It is an instrument.
This is also true.
Let me highlight some of these.
What is this 'cooling' process?
We have enlargement to prepare for.
But what indication?
Work for all is the objective.
We protest against this.
What they need is more staff.
I think that would be a very good idea.
Let us be truly creative for Europe.
We want to see these amended.
We want to improve it.
So what has gone wrong?
We have a fight on our hands.
I find this regrettable.
What do we mean by 'succeeding' ?

Fifthly and lastly: the timetable.
I doubt it.
Yes, I should like to outline five.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
As is the Convention.
I could also put that another way.
I would like to make something clear.
These are my comments on enlargement.
That is a bit mean.
Thank you, Mr Michel.
The debate needs to take place.
Let us not be afraid of words.
What do we want to do together?
Do we want to stay where we are?
And how?
Thank you, Commissioner Barnier.
The debate is closed.
Procedural motions (continued)
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
He has been there for three weeks.
Combating terrorism/EUROJUST
I wish you a successful debate.
This is an essential component.
I do not feel this is fair.
Thank you, Madam President.
All of that needs to be reconciled too.
We have always listened to experts.
I categorically refute this.
You will see this from the texts.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Aviation safety
The two must not be confused.

Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Communities' financial interests
Why?
We are striving to be that.
And this is beginning to bear fruit.
It is like police statistics.
We cannot do without this mechanism.
You have mentioned this.
Nobody would understand it.
However, there is a problem.
This situation is quite pathetic.
What do we do when we find fraud?
This is a real problem.
Thank you very much, Mrs Stauner.
The joint debate is closed.
Quality of petrol and diesel fuels
We are talking about very low contents.
We give this proposal a fair wind.
I have a problem.
This concerns the financial incentives.
Let me turn to some other amendments.
There is humility for you!
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Egypt
The next item is the joint debate on:
and on oral questions:
Here is an opportunity for action.
Egypt is a friend.
I urge the House to support the motion.
(Parliament rejected the request)

We must be on our guard.
(Interruption by Mr Cashman)
Need I say more?
That was not on a point of order!
The debate is closed.
Aid for reconstruction
We await this report with interest.
That is where the Agency comes in.

Perhaps I shall not need all this time.
Democracy, too, is making progress.
A lot remains to be done, however.
First of all, a word about Macedonia.
Now it is being done in Macedonia.
I am happy to do that.
I will tell the Parliament why.
That is also good to hear.
I did it!
That is certainly the case.
Thank you, Commissioner Solbes.
The debate is closed.
Do these people not matter to us?
This is not FYROM or Macedonia.
What is the aim of this fund?
Is it only for prevention?
These are the questions we must ask.
How will this fund be managed?
This is totally unacceptable.
Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 00.05 a.m.)
Human genetics
People are right to be concerned.
The first problem concerns the embryo.
There is nothing more to be said.
That is what the Fiori report says.
Each needs the other.
We need clear ethical boundaries.
That is politics, not research.
We have therefore re-tabled it.
It is complicated and it is difficult.
The spirit of Galileo is with us today.




Thank you, Mr Vidal-Quadras.
I agree with you.
I am thoroughly disappointed.
We must set standards here.
But there is a lot of clarity here.
Sometimes we simply do not see it.
All we have to do is stick to it.
It cannot be allowed.
I will leave the matter there.
I reject both extremes.
Life is undoubtedly a process.
Our view is clear.
What is human dignity?
Commissioner, please be robust.
We must provide a counterweight.
What is the real issue here?
Let me be quite clear.
Is there a right to life-long health?
New techniques are available.
It can also be used reproductively.
No, it is not acceptable.
It is up to politics to set boundaries.
We must decide.
It is high time we did.
I congratulate Mr Fiori.
Vote
This a controversial report.

In English, it is worded as follows:

Could I also ask, Madam President...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
I have two points.
Certainly, Mr Fitzsimons.
(The speaker brandished a poster)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you.
Are we all thieves?
Are we all idlers?
I do not think so.
The title says it all.
European Food Authority
There should not be any undue delay.
These are substantial powers.
Then of course it is up to us.
Safety has to be assessed.
It is a large step and also the first.
We think that is incredibly important.
It has not been an easy task.
Thank you.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I have a few concerns in this respect.
The list goes on.
(The President cut the speaker off)
One last question is that of the site.
The Commission welcomes this.
Thank you very much indeed.
Two points have emerged.

It is an acceptable compromise.
Mr van Velzen hit the right note.
We have not used the word 'veto' .
A new framework is therefore necessary.
We still have two weeks to go.
It is, of course, a compromise.
We must absolutely encourage their use.
We proceed along those lines.
I will come back to that later.
But this compromise is a balanced one.
Everybody had a role to play.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
But these things happen.
If this is true it is most welcome.
I want to believe it.
I would love to see the evidence.
Support is meant to be transparent.
SMEs are an engine for jobs in Europe.
If that is not a success...
How is sustainability ensured?
Thank you, Mr President.
Secondly, on geographical coverage.
Thirdly, on the instruments.
Circulation of compound feedingstuffs
But a good thing is worth waiting for.
We now have open declaration.
So, many thanks.
Thirdly, there is the positive list.
Now it is being reinstated.
This task is very complex.
The debate is closed.
Vote on requests for urgent procedure
Katiforis (PSE).
President.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
President.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
We already have the right recipe.
So where do these worries stem from?






Thank you for your attention.
Thank you Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck.
(Applause)
I shall wind up now, Madam President.
(Applause)
But that is your problem.
Is it proportionate?
Does it respect subsidiarity?
Is it transparent and accountable?
We have got to get it right.
That is all very well.
We agree.
Why?
What ideal are we talking about then?
Still we have not received them.
We are humiliated the whole time.
That is not only a right we possess.
That is impossible.
Why is this totally insufficient?
Secondly, we have a lack of detail.
I fully agree with this sentiment.
It will be an extremely important time.
The debate is closed.
WTO meeting in Qatar
This is a very important breakthrough.
Thank you for your attention.
That is an important new development.
The WTO is one of those pillars.
I am referring to the social issues.
We regret that.
That is not a reason for giving up.
My final point concerns agriculture.
I have said it in public.
(Applause)
Now is the time for delivery.
Let me remind you of what Jamaica said.
This is the bottom line.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote
Vote (continuation)
(Parliament adopted the joint text)
Mr President, one word of explanation.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Cunha report (A5-0425/2001)
.
Gargani report (A5-0428/2001)
.
Whitehead report (A5-0416/2001)
Food is extremely important!
We agree with the principle.
.
I voted in favour of this report.
.
.
.
Bushill-Matthews report (A5-0422/2001)
All I need is the money!"
.
.
.
.
That concludes voting time.
I thank you for your attention.
They went far beyond the call of duty.
Once again, thank you all very much.
Unfortunately, I did not do this.
The budget is a means, not an end.
This is the real increase.
That is what we do not like.
This is the key point of our report.
I know his reasons why.
I have spoken to him about them.
That was an issue in itself.
What are we going to do about that?
Where is that money going to come from?
That is also worth emphasising.
Thank you, Mr Tajani.
This is good news for everyone.
No European refugee fund.
That brings me to the third problem.
But that is a matter for next year.
There was nothing else to be done.
Of that I am convinced.
Dialogue must be put on a formal basis.
Enlargement is drawing ever nearer.
The agricultural budget is realistic.
Our group supports all these decisions.
The EU does not have a money shortage.
I find that quite unacceptable.
Many thanks.
So must the Mediterranean region.
We must keep closer watch.
The first concerns the reform.
Thank you, Mr President.
I do not want to smash the project.
That is not my agenda.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Sheer balderdash!
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
What are his or her powers?
What does that mean in detail?
Another is Eurojust.
We must be prepared for a long haul.
Will it lead to corpus juris?
What powers would he or she have?
This is indeed a correct account.
I wonder if you could comment on that.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
You must not enter into a dialogue.
Question Time (Commission)
Part I
Question No 39 by (H-0878/01):
Therefore it is a very serious problem.
So Slovenia has got a real problem.
We know that there is a real problem.
There are numerous problems.
This is just one other application.
Question No 41 by (H-0917/01):
It was very strange to experience.
Knowledge, as such, is a strong weapon.
It is a moral issue.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Question No 45 by (H-0873/01):
Obviously, you do not lie.
This is no longer acceptable.
Question No 46 by (H-0912/01):
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Questions to Commissioner Lamy
Question No 42 by (H-0895/01):
I have two follow-up questions.
Question No 43 by (H-0935/01):
We worked together with them at Doha.

Thank you very much, Mr Lamy.
Questions to Commissioner Byrne
Question No 47 by (H-0880/01):
This opinion is expected early in 2002.
Question No 49 by (H-0908/01):
Thank you very much for your answer.
You then asked me about shellfish.
Question No 48 by (H-0889/01):
Question No 50 by (H-0942/01):
Is that correct?
I should just like to clarify this.
WTO meeting in Qatar (continuation)
(The President cut the speaker off)
In Qatar, we saw a breakthrough.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you, Madam President.
Yet for whom was it a success?
The clich√©s are piling up.
Korea has maybe stayed with it.
The European Union is showing cracks.
What will remain of Europe?
We are opposed to total liberalisation.
I would also like to thank the Council.
Let me make another point.
After Doha that has changed.
But let there be no illusions.
Now, though, to my main criticism.
I hesitate.
It is permissible to doubt.
Lastly, if the failure...
(The President cut the speaker off)
We shall try to do better next time.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Public health (2001 - 2006)
rapporteur.
Finally, the budget.
There is a problem here.
We must live in the real world.
The debate is closed.
Undesirable substances in animal feed
We must make the 2006 stage mandatory.
Thank you, Madam President.
This is a fair position.
Conciliation will now be inevitable.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikaanen.
The debate is closed.
The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.
(Applause)
I thank you all.
We must stop this.
Korea will actively participate.
This is the goal and ideal of ASEM.
Unification will come.
Terrorism must be eradicated.
Are there any comments?
That is the difficulty that we are in.
Area of freedom, security and justice
(The President cut the speaker off)
The Union is at a crossroads.
Whose fault is that?
Today, we must seize the moment...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Many thanks, Commissioner Vitorino!
This is not on.
Europe has put its house in order.
Europe has shown its capacity to act.
We must vote against this resolution!
Nonetheless we must remain objective.
These efforts have not been fruitless.
The Council is aware of this matter.
Various scenarios are being examined.
We have never appealed to you in vain.
I quote word for word.
(Applause)
Sir, your speaking time is up.
Mr Tajani has a point of order.
Absolutely not, in most cases.
Hence the need for external action.
We have two types of external action.
It is also a question of our resources.
How pleased should we be now?
Here too, we must not exaggerate.
Security without freedom is tyranny.
We are living in a world of paradoxes.
Let me start with the past.
And finally to the future.
This needs to be said very plainly.
I have no illusions, however.
(Applause from the left)
The debate is closed.
(Vigorous applause)
We shall now proceed to the vote.

Hazan report (A5-0414/2001)
That concludes voting time.
Middle East

(Applause)
I would strongly argue the opposite.
There is much further to go.
One final point.
What is past is past.
That is an absolute requirement.
But we must go on.
Let us follow their example.
To give them rights?
Do not take sides. Be good Samaritans.
We will vote accordingly.
Europe is resolutely taking this line.
The violence is terrible.
So indeed is the spiral of violence.
That is our most fervent hope.
That is not the case.
It must be halted.
It must be ended.
The debate is closed.
And that is what concerns us.
How far have we got in this regard?
Work is under way on this issue too.
Is that wise?
And then the security rules.
I am very hesitant about that.
Why?
I would like to mention some of these.
'May we see the telephone directory?'
'How many laws are there?'
'Sorry, we are not counting.'
'How many projects are you running?'
'How many committees are there?'
'Sorry, that is a secret.'
'Sorry.'
That is right.
We must also respond in other ways.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We have not.
That was agreed.
So there is nothing new.
We were given promises from both...
(The President cut the speaker off)
That has not been addressed.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0861/01):
Question No 2 by (H-0862/01):
Question No 4 by (H-0864/01):
I am sorry, I do not know.
He said 79 million.
This poses no problem.
This is our ongoing policy.
I repeat, that is not the question.
That is genuinely appreciated.
We will have to see how far we can go.
We can read it together afterwards.
This is a joint answer.
Question No 5 by (H-0865/01):
Time is not on our side.
Question No 6 by (H-0869/01):
Thank you.
Question No 7 by (H-0874/01):
Question No 8 by (H-0876/01):
I can only repeat the same answer.

Question No 9 by (H-0879/01)
Thank you very much.
Conflict prevention
I now give the floor to Mr Lagendijk.
What do I mean by this?
We have competences in this area.
It is used as a last resort.
Unexpected support from an opponent?
I have my reservations about this.
Rather, it brought shame on this House.
The Sakharov Prize is not enough.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is a topical debate.
Let me be crystal clear.
Nothing excuses or mitigates terrorism.
It is based on four main objectives.
The honourable Member raised this.
Mr Sacr√©deus raised this as well.
The UN is a key partner here.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Mr Gahler has the floor.
, rapporteur.
I hope I can count on your support.
Thank you, Commissioner.

I see this as watering down.
We must lend a truly helping hand.
Thank you, Mr Belder.
The debate is closed.
Maritime safety
The next item is the joint debate on:
Together we have achieved a great deal.
I will not dwell on the other reports.
My fellow rapporteurs will do that.
That is an innovation and I welcome it.
A ship with a black box is a safe ship.
But we must remain vigilant.
That is our duty and responsibility.
I hope we can live up to that.
No!
I am relying on you to push for this.
rapporteur.

The legal framework is in place.
However, I regularly suffer nightmares.
I urge them to do so.
I think that he is right.
This must be seen as clear progress.
The joint debate is closed.
I congratulate you.
And this is not the case here.
Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
Financial collateral arrangements
Many thanks!
Now I come to the tabled amendments.
We thank you on behalf of Parliament.

I would like to encourage him further.
But I welcome the signs of change.
That is discrimination.

Why should this be the case?
That is not the case.
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Flags of convenience in fisheries
There are also serious social problems.
Fishing is now a global industry.
Markets are also global.
We should go in that direction also.
All of these issues are in the report.
Even in Europe we can and must act.
What will this entail?
We also concur on Nos 15, 19 and 22.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.

Parliament has a right to know.
I am curious.
This agreement is morally bankrupt.
This is the reality.
It is set to continue - and why?
So what exactly is the truth?
That is the reality.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Production and marketing of honey
No.
You understand that, Mr Fischler.
That would be a real pity.

The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
Thank you for your observations.
Topical and urgent debate
Zimbabwe
on Zimbabwe
We have been wrong every time.
There are no such glimmers.
The situation is alarming.
He has made the poor even poorer.
Mugabe should not fear.
He will be judged on his record.
The idea is to hold them next month.
The regional dimension is important.
The debate is closed.
Cluster bombs
on cluster bombs.
So much for the theory.
In practice, things are very different.
The debate is closed.
Human rights
Women in Afghanistan
They were banned from public life.
Everyone is still afraid.
I must warn you not to expect miracles.
There are many deep-seated differences.
Indonesia
The opposite turns out to be true.
The same applies to Sulawesi.
Immigration in Ireland
This situation cannot continue.
We must look forward.
Togo
We are not calling for a pardon.
We are all aware of this.
They are also both female politicians.
Why?
That is not enough, however.
All the groups are agreed.
Thank you for listening.
We attach great importance to this.
The joint debate is closed.
Nepal
Illiteracy is another major problem.
Those I spoke to did not agree.
They are excellent.

The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.
The Congo
In Kinshasa they think the latter.
It is not up to us.
Villages and towns are destroyed.
These measures are essential.
How are they going to be implemented?
Who will lead this action?
The EU, the USA or the UN?
I could not answer.
I could not answer that either.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m.

These are not radical proposals.
Let us ensure that we all protect this.
Just a personal comment at the outset.
My spokesman does not speak Danish.
The flow of work would simply choke.
I am sorry, but it has to be said.
We mean the same thing.
We just need less flippancy here.
The joint debate is closed.

There is no other option.

Announcement by the President
I am not going to make a speech.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
(Applause)
I thank you for doing that.
Thank you, Mrs Garaud.
I do not want to add anything else.
European Council/Belgian Presidency
(Applause)
One thing must be clear from now on.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
We have a great responsibility.
We must be able to take risks.
I salute and thank you for that.
But so be it.
(Applause)
Do not be overly disappointed.
We have not succeeded.
(Applause)
The same applies to enlargement.
This, in any case, is what I believe.
I support the European Union.
I disagree with you, Mr Lannoye.
Three men of a certain age.
For me that sends the wrong signals.
It is certainly unprecedented.
Thank you for the 60 questions or so.
Frankly, I would have wished for more.
We will exploit that freedom.
Why?
You outlined a dream a moment ago.
The first concerns the Convention.
That praise, I think, is due.
Where are the critics?
Where are the critics?
Not a significant one, I fear.
What caused this to happen?
These are the two reasons.
We must not overlook this.
(Applause)
It is actually quite simple.
This is also what will actually happen.
I would say, 'why?'
It must be prepared.
Quite the opposite.



(Applause)





What is Europe for?
What are its competences?
That is a good thing.
(Protests from Mr Swoboda)
Each institution has its place.
We must clearly take this into account.
It is not desirable to transpose it.
This is of no small importance.
This is a start.
I believe that this is of importance.
A new era was begun at Laeken.
We are delighted.
But there is still a long way to go.
Whom are we actually addressing?
This requires a multilateral approach.
We are on the right track.
Luckily, these are very broadly based.
This is a very fine initial package.
Deadlock is still assured.
This represents a great opportunity.
On balance it is a very positive one.
On all that we can be pleased.
Thank you very much.
What should we do?
Is there no way forward?
I believe we should welcome this.
Good luck - the work will not be easy!
I hope not.
Do not run before you can walk.
I wish you a happy Christmas.
We must never forget that.
However, that did not happen.

Good morning colleagues.
Eleven languages make 110 combinations.
We risk a Babel-like confusion.
We would then be bad MEPs.
They share the information.
Does "common" really mean "unilateral"?
I have been here for 22 years.
Give yourself a better choice.
He deserves our full support.
But we must continue to try.
I ask you for your support.
But no parliament can work in the dark.
Thirty months is a short time.

I thank you for it.
He has brought that too.
(Applause)
I thank all those who voted for me.

I shall now speak briefly in Irish.
Why do I do this?
Irish is my native tongue.

(Applause)
Allow me to say a final word.
Trust too is important in politics.
(Applause)
Why?
I had none prepared, Mr President.
It was delightful to see him here.
I offer you my warmest congratulations.
It is a victory that was well deserved.
You had to campaign hard for it.
You did so.
I look forward to working with you.
I look forward to working with you.
That is democracy in action.
(Applause)
I wish you well.
I am looking forward to it!
(Laughter and sustained applause)
(Laughter)
I shall try.
And we are democrats.
You are now a President for everyone.
You are now everyone' s President.
We have taken note of this as well.
We are counting on you to do this.
You too, Mr Pasqua.
Mr President, you did it!
It was wonderful.
You had a dream and you succeeded.
I am sure you will succeed again.
We are so proud of you.
We will miss you.
But fortunately you will stay among us.
All the best.
I miss you desperately!
You are no longer the result of a deal.
Congratulations.
I have just one comment to make.
It is 5.30 p.m.
I hope you are in agreement.

Election of Quaestors of Parliament
I would recommend...
(Mixed reactions)
I take note of that.
Let us sort out Mr Berthu's machine.
Mr President, that is not the problem.
(Loud applause)
We know the essential point at issue.
Mr President, on a point of order.
That is my first point.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I do not wish to delay matters.
It is quite simple.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I want to be clear on this.
Spanish Presidency programme
Thank you very much for your attention.
(Applause)
We need to catch up, and catch up fast.
First, employment.
(Applause)
We wish you every success on your way.
(Applause)
It did so before 11 September.
Secondly, I will mention the euro.
We share your concern.
You are perfect hosts.
Is it a cause for amendment?
Centralising what?
The media?
I should like to keep on schedule.
(Applause)
In fact, the opposite is true.
(Applause)
The problem will be what to do next.
Bienvenido.
Thank you Mr President.
Time is running out.
You must hurry up.
You spoke like a Spanish Socialist.
What do you mean by more Europe?
Reflect the reality of Spain in Europe.
Do not try to hide it, Mr Aznar.
Include it in your Presidency.
Let us be firm, but let us also talk.
This will require two things.
And it requires ambition.
His saying that is wholly unacceptable.
We would be very grateful if it did.
We do not think like that.
Europe has to get it right.
This is a job-destroying agenda.
Italy has already been mentioned today.
We often turn a blind eye to this.
Why is it not invoked?
I will return to that in a moment.
Allow me to finish in Catalan...
...
We have misgivings about your approach.
I could not agree more.
I would like to endorse that too.
Good luck in what you intend!
Two major events have occurred.
Its reform cannot ignore this reality.
Who is to fund them?
The Stability Pact must be respected.
A challenge to do what?
(Applause)
(Applause)
Vote
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the decision)
(Parliament adopted the decision)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)

President.
That concludes the vote.

Election of Quaestors of Parliament
Voting: 570, valid votes: 567.
Majority: 284.
Mr Poos: 304 - elected
Mr Balfe: 288 - elected
Mrs Smet: 288 - elected
Mr Marinho: 264
Mrs Maes: 116.
No further votes are required.
I invite you to a brief reception.
Welcome
You are very welcome, Vladimir.
Introduction of the euro
Thank you, Commissioner.
We must stay consistent on this point.
(Applause)
So let us act on that basis.
Thank you.
Shopkeepers should also be praised.
This is our model.
No, they have not.
There have been photocopies.
The debate is closed.
Procurement
.
That is in the text as well.
For that you have my gratitude.
They no longer fulfil their purpose.
Nor does the Commission take that view.
Who can best take that decision?
Is it best taken in Brussels?
Is it best taken in London?
It must be open and transparent.
It employs 80 people.
Why should that be otherwise?
Why should it have to do anything else?
That is fine.
What sort of world are we living in?
We want to oblige them to do that.
We should not do it.
There are lots of opportunities here.
No!
2 is worse, no.
Mr President, I shall try to be brief.
There is still some misunderstanding.
The debate is closed.
Ozone in ambient air
It is hugely transboundary.
But it is not appropriate now.
A reference point was set for 2020.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.


We must adopt it today.
Any satisfaction or progress?
No, unfortunately, neither.
So what should have been done instead?
We must not pass up that opportunity.
So what does the rapporteur want?
Let us remain realistic and pragmatic.
It does not.
But it is still not too late.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Integrated product policy
These tools will still be important.
Thank you, Commissioner Wallstr√∂m.
The debate is closed.
Europe and Space
Europe cannot afford to be sidelined.
That is an important way ahead.
We should take careful note of that.
That is very important to emphasise.
'Tackle it!' must be our watchword.
A political signal is indispensable.
That would be devastating.
That would be Pharisaical!
My speech will focus on three points.
The answer is, a great deal.
Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
Road Transport
This amendment too was accepted.
I am grateful to them for their work.
We will be voting accordingly.
This, too, is an important matter.
Account is taken of this in the report.
Here is a crucial example.
Just 5%.
Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
The joint debate is closed.
ACP/EC Partnership Agreement
Biodiversity is under threat.
Lom√© had its faults.
This is Parliament's fault.
This partnership has to work.
I share his concerns on this.
This is what experience tells us.
This is a classical case.
This is not the case.
Both are highly relevant for LDCs.
There are real problems there.
This is why we do it.
We welcome this conclusion.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
There are no comments.
(The Minutes were approved)
There are other possibilities.
Mr President, on a point of order.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you.
Future of the common fisheries policy
I have a feeling that it is not.
The subject is simply too important.
Fisheries swam through many a trough.
One thing, though, must be clear.
We owe this to our taxpayers.
When they cannot fish, they do not eat.
Reform is essential.
This has created conflicts.
I withdrew.
This is as it should be.
We are totally opposed to this.
I shall refer to two key issues.

Any other policy would be absurd.
I stress the word "management".
(The President cut the speaker off)
Those are the deplorable facts.
That is why we need regionalisation.
These two objectives are shared by all.
My last point concerns penalties.
Can we achieve a proper balance?
I do not think so.
Would it mean more financial support?
We have an opportunity to get it right.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Stocks of cod and hake
But we do.
The Commission's own words are telling.
Long may this continue.
Even today the cod have not returned.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.

This also endangers fishing.
The Verts/ALE Group cannot support it.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Vote
You have a rookie in the Chair.
I intend to do that myself.

It augurs well.

Madam President, on a point of order.
The proposal is quite simply designed.
I doubt whether that is true.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.

This is caused mainly by two factors.

Leonardo da Vinci programme (1995-1999)
What is going on?
Did this happen or not?
And for us then to decide.
We must therefore proceed in this way.
In principle, I share Mr Pronk' s view.
Please stick to the rules of fair play.
Basle II
I will say more about this in a moment.
I welcome a risk-sensitive framework.
It is vital that we get this right.
There are two points still outstanding.
After all, we cannot all take part.
It will be a very rapid process.
I should like to make three points.
I mentioned the global framework.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
Vote
I voted for the motion, Mr President.
Kauppi report (A5-0450/2001)

Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 5.10 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Are there any comments?
I hope that this can be rectified.
Yes, indeed, Mr Pronk.
Announcement by the President
I believe we can build on it.
That is what we expect tomorrow.
(Applause)
Procedural remarks
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr Corrie, I shall be pleased to do so.
Drug trafficking
These issues are all far too ambitious.
Our goal is, in fact, far more modest.
This is rather forced in my opinion.
Today, the waters are somewhat calmer.
In general, I think he has succeeded.
However, I am not so certain.
I do not accept that.
Who in fact makes the profit?
We must know who they are.
They must be tackled.
What have we done wrong?
Third-country nationals
It is only adding an EU dimension.
I will return to the UK position later.
We must, then, put down markers.
This is a balanced proposal.
Why is this?
It is a balanced approach.
This is a momentous issue for Europe.
I have a couple of comments, however.
My apologies also to Baroness Ludford.
We must have things sorted out by then.
We ask Parliament not to approve it.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
Relief, rehabilitation and development
This is tragic.
The figures speak for themselves.
The debate is closed.
Workers' rights
The next item is the joint debate on:
That is an extremely useful definition.
Most delegations were against.
It is not the only example.
This should all be improved.
This is a good result, in my view.
In short, there is a lot to be done.
What was possible has now been done.
I congratulate them for their skill.
Politics is certainly an odd business.
It is also a European phenomenon.
That is the situation we face.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is the situation we are living in.
(The President cut the speaker off.)
The joint debate is closed.
Energy performance of buildings
We should now proceed to give it teeth.
Are we trying to save energy?
These are not all the same things.
Mr Adam mentioned Amendment No 15.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon..
(The sitting was closed at 8.50 p.m.)
Announcement by the President
EIB Annual Report for 2000
It made the work considerably easier.
I also wish to thank my colleagues.
Now it is also Russia' s turn.
I agree with that.
There is a need to go further, however.
This should mean a big improvement.
We must not stop the support measures.
One final plea, Mr President.
There must be changes here.

The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at noon.
Financial services legislation
What, then, is this debate about?
That proposal is a very good one.
Where, then, is the problem?
What have we achieved?
Transparency first of all.
We also get to see preliminary drafts.
Congratulations to all of you.
That is also very important.
But there has been a key problem.
The time factor is crucial.

Mr Corbett has also done so.
The Commission is well aware of that.
Methinks this is a poetic exaggeration.
The Commission congratulates him.
Those remarks will be Minuted.
We shall pay attention to that.
This was, fortunately, clear today.
That is not so.
Thank you, Karl.
That is why we are so sceptical.
Equal with whom and equal to what?
So far, so good!
And what are we doing today?
That is perfectly correct.
What more can Mr Goebbels want?
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at noon.




Congratulations, Mr Katiforis.
That is a tragedy.
This time, Mr Katiforis is wrong.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Mr Corrie, your point is well made.
Your suggestion is one possibility.
Conversations are for outdoors.

The next item is the vote.

Situation in the Middle East
Should we be pessimistic then?
What can we do from now on?
I have a little bit of hope.
I cannot say that there is a lot.
This is the idea we are working on.
I cannot guarantee success.
There is no other solution.
Will we have success immediately?
There is no guarantee of that.
I can assure you that there is.
The first is Afghanistan.
Firstly, Pakistan.
I believe that we must work with them.
And thirdly, Russia.
We will win this battle.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Again, why?
(Applause)
(Applause)
No, we are not anti-Semitic.
(Applause)
All this we welcome.
(Applause)
I agree with you wholeheartedly.
Where, though, does it get us?
(Applause)

(Applause)
This is why we must not give up.
He is as hypocritical as Mr Sharon.
There is a second - Mr Sharon.
We must therefore make ourselves heard.
What do we think of this?
Welcome
There are two indications of this.
This proposal has been put forward.
I too nurture some small hope.
And Mr Arafat embraced them.
However, this is no longer 1967.
Thank you, Mr President.
Bloodshed leads to further bloodshed.
How can he do this?
My view is his as well.
Who do they want to replace him with?
I am referring to Zimbabwe.
I have some questions for Mr Solana.
What can the European Union do?
What is the EU' s reaction to this?
No, we are not.
But what happens?
Therefore, you are back to square one.
I have not received many questions.
They work together every day.
Israel has changed.
That has disappeared.
That is something we have to do.
This is not a question only of values.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
What are the main characteristics?
That is something I welcome.
There is one question I have to ask.
That would have two main drawbacks.
I would like to make some comments.
I will be brief.
I believe not - on the contrary.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Part I
Question No 39 by (H-0030/02):
You must be a very happy man.
Who pays for it all?
Who pays then?
Who bears the costs?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Question No 41 by (H-0054/02):
Question No 43 by (H-0042/02):
Has this idea worked?
I think it has.
Internet penetration has increased.
What are the new challenges?
Real interactivity is still rare.
How do you intend to tackle this?
I have just a few remarks.
We can guarantee skills for everybody.
Should that be a solution?
The Commission supports these efforts.

Question No 45 by (H-0008/02):




Question No 46 by (H-0035/02):
What progress has been made?
Question No 47 by (H-0015/02):
This is totally unacceptable.
Questions to Commissioner Patten
Question No 52 by (H-0960/01):
The amount envisaged is EUR 24 m.
However, we will do all that we can.
Question No 54 by (H-0965/01):
In conclusion, work is well in hand.
Question No 55 by (H-0002/02):
Give us some hope that it will happen.
So we are making progress.
Subject: International Criminal Court
VAT - Direct and indirect taxation
Many thanks for that.
It is the thin end of the wedge.
It is extremely constructive.
It is about administrative cooperation.
I wish the Commission could do that.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
State aid
But, joking aside ...
That cannot always be done.
That, then, is something I value.
As I have said, I have named them.
Let us cut back on it a little.
There are 22 paragraphs in this report.
He has raised the issue consistently.
This commitment must be kept to.
I have nothing new to report on this.
Please give us a free economy.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
Monitoring of BSE
Experience so far is alarming, however.
Our objective is food safety.
This is the English version.
These are the things I want to say.
It is high time that was done.
How is it going to be processed?
Thank you, Madam President.
We have to be very frank about this.
However, this makes no sense.
We must make it our concern.
Just try making sense of that.
That is still the case.
I want to thank him for this report.
Thank you, Commissioner.
BSE is still a problem.
That concludes the debate.
Climate change
It is this view that most divides us.

We will be voting unanimously.
Three major questions remain.
Now there is talk of emissions trading.
This time, Europe is indeed ahead.
That is something that I welcome.
Some have already referred to that.
That is very important.
Thank you, Mr Moreira da Silva.
I hope that this will be possible.
That concludes the debate.
Education and training systems
The same applies to education.
This is welcome.
I encourage this.
We need dialogue at school unit level.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
Resumption of the sitting
We need it and the work is excellent.
(Applause)
(Applause)
That is our business.
(Applause)
These are the aims of my presidency.
(Applause)
This is something we cannot allow!
(Applause)
We are there alongside you.
(Applause)
We must keep this up.
Secondly, the Members' Statute.
First of all: governance.
Secondly, immunity.
Lastly, the Convention.
We want to monitor.
A great deal of progress has been made.
The will to reform is there.
You are moving closer to them.
We are putting our trust in this.
We fully support you in doing this.
I myself have come up with three ideas.
I mentioned three examples.
I welcome that.
Let us debate the political issues.
That is important too.
They too have a role.
It did not want to answer questions.
We should not accept that.
We will support that reform.
He mentioned the need for the statute.
That is good, right and proper.
Let us have debate and discussion.
Are we doing Parliament justice?
Is that promoting foreign relations?
No, not in any shape or form.
I warmly support you.
Good luck with the reform work!
That means a little navel-gazing.
So we have to combine the two.
We need to lock it down.
But it is right that we should.
I concur with Mr Collins.
For that I warmly congratulate you.
Information more so than communication.
They are not the same.
Communication is about bringing news.
How will we deal with this?
How will we tackle this?
Why do we not hold an open debate?
Not with the intention to indoctrinate.
The debate is closed.
Combating terrorism
The next item is the joint debate:
and
What do these measures do?
I commend these measures to the House.
The terrorist threat is deadly serious.
It requires a serious response.
I disagree with them.
We must respond.
I agree with this.
And you need not be frightened.
They are not even referred to.
However, I do have some concerns.
This is a very positive response.
We all abhor and condemn terrorism.
That is a really effective remedy.
We will never consider it to be enough.
I am myself from Germany.
Big Brother is watching you.
This Parliament is merely consulted.
Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We want to see practical results.
These are the bare facts.
The pledges for 2015 are clear.

This is not a short-term project.

The vote will take place on Thursday.
Declarations are needed in these areas.
Let there be a resolution this year.
Secondly, Zimbabwe.
Finally, Tunisia.
A lot has changed this year.
All of these issues are on the agenda.
This is our interpretation.
This has to be understood.
Politics never goes away.
Nothing about Zimbabwe is easy.
I think strongly there ought to be.
Let us support it with our vote.
But that is not enough.
But in what fields?

Why must we do this?
I think that this is one of our assets.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We must, however, be careful.
It will resume at 9 p.m.

That is a great mistake.
Question No 15 by (H-0010/02):
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Economic and social cohesion
The problem is not a small one.
That is for us of primary importance.
This forces us to make choices.
The overall thrust is quite correct.
I will be brief.
It is impossible.
That is quite correct.
I disagree with what Mr Purvis said.
What do we want to do together?
I cannot prove this single-handedly.
We proposed a phasing-in process.
Speed limitation devices
I do not believe that is the case.

It is a vital debate.
This is a tragedy, and why?
I think that this is very important.
Why has traffic been suspended?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Vote
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Bonde and Sandb√¶k (EDD), in writing.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 6.40 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
Order of business
I move now to the order of business.
(The House agreed to this proposal)
Decisions taken at today's meeting
(Applause)

(Interruptions)
Just calm down!
The Council is not here today.
(Applause)
In my opinion, this is a good idea.
The second point is security.
This we have done.
Please carry on in this way.
You have our support.
I believe this is very important.
This is the line we are taking.
...
These are facts, statistics.
Which countries will take part?
That is major progress.
Thank you President Prodi.
That was not foreseen for this session.
This is what I wanted to say:
Mr President.
That concludes the debate.
Barcelona European Council
The next item is the joint debate on:






Thank you very much, Mr President.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr President.
We are in a new situation.
We want organised markets.
Evidently, we were wrong.
It contained two different strategies.
Muchas palabras sin hechos.
This is another matter altogether.
.
Are we to abandon these objectives?
I will tell you why.
What does Lisbon focus on?
She faces a tremendous uphill struggle.
I represent the south west of England.
We have exhausted fish stocks.
Fifthly, reform of the States' budgets.
I think that this need is universal.
It is crucial that we listen to them.
How did this come about?
This is really outrageous!
This must also be put a stop to.
It is working with great honesty.
Can we pretend to believe this?
This is unacceptable.
(Applause from the right)
And yet, what do we have?
What do we have?
What has become of their impetus?
That cannot be done in an ad hoc way.
I have just two comments to make.
Why?
Thank you, Mr President.
Spain is a good example of this.


The debate is closed.
International Criminal Court

Mr President, right is wrong.
It should naturally be universal.
The debate is closed.
.
Initial results are already visible.
Allow me to draw a clear comparison.
I believe that we cannot accept that.
They are charged with separatism.
Thank you very much, Mrs Uca.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
.eu" Top Level Domain

The debate is closed.
Light was shed on all the sectors.
The framework agreement is a mess.
We must ensure value for money.
It has been really splendid.
What have you got to hide?
The debate is closed.

How will this EUR 4 million be managed?

This is very bizarre.
What are these other sundry expenses?
The debate is closed.
EU relations with South Caucasus


Congratulations!
Let us hope so!
Reflection and diplomacy are required.
That is not the case.
It is Europe's gateway to Asia.
But where does this leave Europe?
Thank you very much Mr President.
The debate is closed.
Impact of transport on public health
This is also a very timely debate.
I would counter that very strongly.
We need to be very clear about that.
Action in this field is urgent.
I hope we shall obtain a good result.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Labour cost index
Mr Mayol i Raynal has the floor.
That is the objective of Article 1.
Here are a few points to consider.
It may, however, raise some questions.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
It gives us a way to plan forward.
Socrates Programme
But, to be honest, it is not enough.
This is unacceptable to my group.
What is the reason for that?
What is my brief here?
I welcome the report which is positive.
Thank you all again.
That is great!
The new procedures are now in place.
Delivery is planned for August 2003.
Lastly, there are the Joint Actions.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Culture 2000 Programme
This is very useful.
It is all too familiar.
We have two major problems.
There are plenty of problems.
More is probably needed.
What should their initiatives involve?
What should the European Union do?

We believe that is entirely reasonable.
You are quite right.
Thank you, Commissioner Reding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Youth Programme
There is a need for further work here.
I think that is acceptable.
.
I see that, though, as appropriate.
Why is this programme valuable?
Then there is the issue of girls.
Thank you, Commissioner Reding.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Vote
That is very democratic behaviour.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That concludes the vote.
Report MacCormick (A5-0032/2002)
Report MacCormick (A5-0033/2002)


Report Mayol i Raynal (A5-0461/2001)
No, Mr President!
Costs for whom, exactly?
For society?
, in writing.
We believe it is the other way round.
And there can be no middle way here.
Report Karas (A5-0031/2002)
Report Blak (A5-0024/2002)
The Member States!
What does this mean?
Sustainable development strategy
I have voted in favour of the report.
International Criminal Court
We feel that this is not the case.
Hence my vote against the report.
Democratic rights in Turkey
.
This is still not the case in Turkey.
Report Gahrton (A5-0028/2002)
Report Lucas (A5-0014/2002)
Report Pack (A5-0021/2002)
I deserve a more important programme.
This is what I have done.
Report Gra√ßa Moura (A5-0018/2002)
Report Gr√∂ner (A5-0019/2002)
Oh no - that is not acceptable.
That concludes voting time.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 12.11)
Resumption of the session
We now move to the order of business.
Wednesday:
This is the only reason, Mr President.
I really do crave your indulgence.
Could we perhaps clarify this again?
I hope he is feeling alright.
Just listen for a moment!
I always listen to you.
That is the condition we impose.
(Applause)
(Laughter and applause)
The tunnel was closed last Wednesday.
It is affecting businesses.
No-one seems to care.
To date we have received no reply.
I believe it is our duty to do so.
Commissioner, you mentioned Tobin tax.
We must persuade them to be more open.
That is simply impossible.
So are there no problems at all?
That is a big problem.
We must insist on this point.
Is this sufficient?
Possibly not.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We would ask the Commission how much.
Many thanks.
Let me turn to Mr Andreasen's report.
That was precisely what the people did.
Are we really getting value for money?
IT is properly addressed in the report.
This report is not before time.
It must not be allowed to gather dust.
, rapporteur.
Mr President, this is the prize.
It is now, I believe, within our grasp.
They feel a little neglected.
I hope that is so.
That is the case and will remain so.
The debate is closed.
Did the Council agree with that?
Yes, they did.
Did we get that?
Yes, we did.
Did they agree with that?
Yes, they did.
Did they give us that?
Yes, they did.
This is very important.
This is not wise, in my view.
Why?
There is nothing new in the debate.
There is absolutely nothing new here.
I urge my fellow Members?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Who is correct?
We have to acknowledge this.
This is positive.
And this is no small matter.
That will be the case only in 2006.
What is the issue here?
Let me mention four points.
The debate is closed.
We are not as flexible as I would like.
That, though, is our objective.
That is why this issue is so difficult.
The reason was as follows:
(the speaker continued in French)
(the speaker continued in Swedish)
These are the facts.
Let us move on to remuneration.
The rights balance each other out.
The debate is closed.
My group does not seek to change that.
It has the right of initiative.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 9.15 p.m.)
Opening of the session
Thank you very much, Mr Stevenson.
Thank you.
So an end to hypocrisy!
and
This is a tenth of the entire budget.
I believe this is vital.
The first is enlargement.
That would just not be on.
There are in fact only two options.
That, again, is of course a new step.
Why temporary staff?
The Financial Plan does not permit it.

Issue No 2: foreign policy.
There is more to come.
Issue No 3: agricultural policy.
It should not be left to Parliament.
We want to prevent social exclusion.
The situation is therefore alarming.
Surely this cannot be our aim.
There are 800 of them.
There are none.
Clearly, there is something wrong!
This is not a day too soon.
All of it should be poverty-focused.
I fully support that particular point.
That is my gripe.
The first is on the F√§rm report.
I now turn to Mr Stenmarck's report.
They should not wear political colours.
I wish them every success.
The same applies to category 5.
We will not achieve anything that way.
Why?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
There are five preconditions for this.
This depends on many factors.
This brings me to my second subject.
A supply monopoly cannot be justified.
This too violates current law.
We owe this to our consumers.
What is on today's agenda?
So what are the key points?
The consumer must have free choice.
And this could never be the intention.
But that is precisely what it is.
This must change.
I am in favour of these measures.
That is the aim of my amendment.
I should like to make two points.
He is absolutely correct.
This is relevant.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the vote.
Simplified procedure:
and
Before the vote:
I hope there are no objections to this.
Report F√§rm (A5-0068/2002)
Hence our position against the report.
.
What is the meaning of this?
.
What can be done about this?
There are two types of measures.
The Commissioner had no other choice.
And why the benefit of the doubt?
We see three points rather differently.
I do not think so.
We had the choice.
Then suddenly, there was action.
I look forward to the report.
This is something I cannot endorse.
I thought you might be interested.
However, I have many reservations.

Thank you very much, Mr President.
The debate is closed.
The rapporteur was willing to do so.
Allow me to explain.
People only have rights.
We must take care.
That does not exist.
They will not do it!
We know it, fundamentalism or not.
The report makes two mistakes.
We can and must take action.
The report is also inconsistent.
This proposal is quite specific.
The debate is closed.
These developments are to be deplored.
This is now being rectified.
(Interjection: Or even in Parliament!)
This is not just my own view.
Mr President, two things.
No.
Thank you very much.
The vote is closed.
Mrs de Palacio has the floor.
Cover expires at the end of March.
When will you do so?
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
Thank you very much, Mrs de Palacio.
That concludes this item.
Part I
The child's interests are the priority.
Are there any alternative systems?
Subject: Take-over bids
Second part
Questions to Commissioner Lamy
What steps are planned?
We do not believe in such a system.
That is our guiding principle.
First of all, it is a good idea.
Questions to Commissioner Wallstr√∂m
Subject: Packaging and packaging waste
I think that there are deadlines.
Can you tell me what your views are?
Subject: Water Framework Directive
I am aware of the Marina study.
I am very interested in its outcome.
I have also made a complaint.
Subject: Brominated flame retardants
I agree entirely.
Questions to Commissioner Fischler
We must address that.
This is a supplementary point.
This is what I intend to do.
That is my position here.
This is disgraceful!
Subject: Breaking up of fishing vessels
Why?
This is not enough.
No mention is made of biodiversity.
What is the connection?
Action plans cannot be non-committal.
They must set priorities.
This motivates and inspires.
This is being done with EAGGF Funds.
However, this is not enough.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
If only that were so!
(Applause)
If only!
A clear example of misinformation.
Is that too much to ask?
Safety must be the main concern.
We do not do this for food either.
The market that this generates is huge.
Parliament made its view heard.
This is wrong, simply wrong!
This is clearly stated by the Treaties.
This is not the case here.

Many consumers share this hope.
Mr President, this is a bad directive.
She has done a valiant job.
I have nothing against that.
And they would be right to do so.
For this reason I support it.
My God, we have tried!
Two wrongs do not make a right.
(Applause from the left)
Is this what you really want?
Is this really what you want?
We should trust individuals to do so.
That is simply criminal harassment.
It is like when you drink too much.
I fail to understand your thinking.
That really is not the position.
That is the purpose of the exercise.
That is a slander.
It is absolutely wrong.
What about that?
The subject is not an easy one.
They are in favour of this legislation.
He supports this legislation.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
It has gone incredibly well.
I have checked this very carefully.
The ideal world is different.
We must be very careful.
That is a fact.
Some say it is burned.
Nobody really knows.
That is precisely what we do not want.
Thank you for that.
I acknowledge her efforts.
That will take time.
It would be the death of them.
So both positions exist.
That is why I tabled my proposal.
We shall then have a sound solution.
Here we have the example of pigswill.
Nobody would wish this to occur again.
Thank you Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
That is bad enough.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Statement by the President
(Loud applause)
The plan is still in place.
The next stage is clearly mapped out.
We are not going along with that.
The moment of truth is approaching.
A 'European-style' peace.
I support his underlying principles.
Their accession remains conditional.
Who said that it would be simple?
2002 must not be a lost year.
Enlargement must not be delayed.
I have two questions to ask.
This greatly gladdens my heart.
What is at the heart of the Bene?
Not only there, either, might I add!
So what are we doing now?
A final point: languages.
There are now 15.
Take the Balkans as an example.
What are we offering these countries?
That is not on!
We do not, though, negotiate like that.
The debate is closed.
Mr President, I will finish here.

Let us start then with steel.
Well, on 6 March it was not working.
We are therefore ready.
We had taken the necessary precautions.
This is not always easy.
That surely is not the way to go.
This applies to many things.
The question is: how do we rebuff it?
Where do we go from here?
The debate is adjourned.
Spam is untargeted.
The next item is the vote.
Simplified procedure:
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote:

We welcome them here.
We now continue with the vote.
Before the vote:
(Parliament adopted the decision)
Before the vote:
Before the vote:
(Loud applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Before the vote:
I cannot approve this oral amendment.
You know the Rules.
That is the case.
Before the vote on Amendment No. 72:
We rejected that.
Before the vote on Amendment No. 136:
It is just about correcting something.
Before the vote on Amendment No. 149:
(Laughter)
But enough joking.
(Applause)
The first error is in Amendment No 48.
That is the issue.
You are right.
Before the vote on Amendment No. 29:
That is very kind of you.
And by what right?
All of this is laughable.
This is our vision of a public service.
.
This is a good initiative.
.
Having said which, we need:
.
.
That is not the case.
Take the example of pregnant women.
.
I have voted against the report.
In whose interests is this to be done?
.
His report therefore misses the point.
.
.
.
.
.
This is a fundamental principle.
.
On what authority?
With what qualifications?
.
I abstained on this report.
Each new trade dispute is one too many.
We know why.
Talk about collateral damage!
Of course, this cannot be tolerated.
Our market is open.
Commission: take him on.
Go for it!
Steel is an old chestnut.
I would certainly support him in that.
We do not have overcapacity now.
Just whose side is Tony's crony on?
Thank you for this promptness.
The steel crisis is mainly political.
Our retaliation must be convincing.
But we also need good helmsmanship.
We must build a solid ship.
We must show we mean business.
The next item is the Oral Questions:
and

They simply state it.
Mr President, I am both angry and sad.
Why?
This is my first question.
Is this an attempt to reintroduce that?
Please note - an update.
We must all pull together.
The debate is closed.
It is a matter, then, of choosing.
We should move away from that.
I absolutely must warn against that.
At what price?
But how should we respond?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Please stick to your speaking time.
This is not the case.
I do not need to repeat that.
I stand by the Lisbon objectives.
Customers who must have money.
That is unfortunately not what I see.
That is not enough.
Where must we go in the long term?
However, I would like to add one point.
The debate is closed.
The risk will become higher and higher.
Yes, the directive is needed urgently.
Preventive measures must be paramount.
This is a nonsense.
We also considered the degree of guilt.
Thank you for your response.
Could the Council meet with them?
Mr Dupuis, on a point of order.
Yes, Mr President, I can answer.
Thank you for your reply.

Your are raising points of order.

No.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you, Mrs Cerdeira.
Is the Council therefore incompetent?
I would like an answer.
Mr President, no.
I have two follow-up questions.


Mr President, I shall now answer.
I have a number of follow-up questions.
That is unthinkable.

Is it true?
Do you know anything about it?

Mr MacCormick, on a point of order.
Would you like to make a statement?
We are in absolute agreement on that.
This is of course a positive move.
I will deal with each issue in turn.
I agree.
That does not reflect reality.
I should like to underline that.
We must do everything to stamp it out.
That is what Amendment No 35 is about.
Both these aims are equally important.
Thank you, Mr Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.

The result is a compromise.
Therefore we have to live with that.
Thank you, Mr Bolkestein.
Thank you, Mrs Thyssen.
The debate is closed.
All it does is cause trouble.
I very much support this.
The debate is closed.
Where are we in this process?
We need to get through this bad patch.
But its powers are limited.
That would simply be too embarrassing.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
What is civil society?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Our thanks are due to them.
That is what we need to put a stop to.
This custody he could never exercise.
His children no longer wish to see him.
They need policies to be implemented.
What European law should we draw up?
There are the mechanisms of the Hague.
Use them.
It will be.
This is how we shall proceed.
(The sitting was closed at 12. 05 a.m.)
Nuts and locust beans
It has considerable social impact too.
Now to the 16 proposed amendments.
And fourthly, if so, in what form?
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
I have no objection to that.
Is that what we are trying to do?
Is that our objective?
I make no apology for that.
It is a role we have tried to avoid.
Are you in fact guaranteeing jobs?
I would be grateful for clarification.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Which is where fish come in.
That includes reducing customs tariffs.
Secondly, environmental measures.
Thirdly, food safety.
Fourthly, enlargement.
Fifthly, fundamentals.
There are four main problem areas.
Now to the supply situation.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
This is just a pause for thought.
Why a year?
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I cannot accept Amendment No 6.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
That was then revised.
Regarding Amendment No 59
Regarding Amendment No 52
I have a question, Mr President.
(Parliament adopted the amendment)
Regarding Amendment No 44
Regarding Amendment No 46
Regarding Amendment No 54
In any event, we are opposed.
Regarding Amendment No 48

We accept this compromise.
It seems not.
But the Treaty does not allow it'.
Saving is a very good thing.
.

.
.
.
Why am I recalling this?
I support the call for a policy review.
.
(PT) We are still waiting!
I voted in favour of this report.
I voted in favour of this report.
This is absolutely unacceptable!
More than 43% are therefore in default.

I voted in favour of this report.
.
This is why I reject his approach.
That concludes voting time.
Needless to say, we achieved nothing.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Zimbabwe
Moldova
Kyrgyzstan
The case of Mr Hamma Hammami in Tunisia
Zimbabwe
This was to be expected.
Freedom of expression is non-existent.
We hoped and believed.
(Applause)
It seems like a good idea to me.
This is not acceptable, in my view.
Kyrgyzstan is not yet a democracy.
What can we then expect as democrats?
That is certainly true today.
We will be watching for results.
The only aid is TACIS.
Now, there is cause to do so again.
That must not continue.
We must stop grovelling to Ben Ali.
These are the facts.
This trial is a real parody of justice.
Will the armistice hold at long last?
Are they capable of doing a proper job?
Our main help has been humanitarian.
Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
That is all, just to clarify matters.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Thank you Mr Posselt.
Resumption of the session
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr President.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Today is the second time.
The language used is interesting.
We really wanted more than that.
(Applause from the right)
We all stand to benefit from that.
(Applause from the right)
You spoke of public opinion.
(Applause)
Why do you not review that pact?
(Applause)
(Applause)
A final point, Mr President.
We are going to make this a reality.
You succeeded admirably on both counts.
We call on you to do so.
What has become of that study?
See you in Seville!
It is there that democracy begins.
It is therefore a very welcome step.
I hope the House will support it.
I do not share his enthusiasm.
It is tomorrow's Europe.
Priorities have to be set.
For now, only cars can drive through.
This also applies to a few more areas.
It simply cannot and never will do it.
This came across clearly.
It was as I had feared.
Just who does the Council consist of?
Yes, we need more transparency.
Mr Bar√≥n is the exception to the rule.
It is undiluted M√ºller-Armak.
Please send us the common positions.
The end result is open coordination.
This procedure is highly undemocratic.
So who initiated this process?
Thank you, Mr President.
That is the true civil society.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
They are different issues.
And there were a few problems.
Thank you Mr Salafranca.
So, are the priorities the right ones?
That should not be underestimated.
Ukraine is one of those countries.
In Russia too the subject is discussed.
(Applause)
They have failed to safeguard jobs.
Major deficits still exist.
You would give it your best shot.
Would a guide dog help?
And that is my message to you.
That would be an enormous boost.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The next item is the vote.
Motion for a resolution RC B5-0180/2002
It sends the public into raptures.
What am I not convinced by?
Bravo!
Well done!
.
.
What has become of self-determination?
.
This is where two opinions clash.
The price is too high in my opinion.
This is why I reject the outcome.
That concludes the explanations of vote
Resumption of the session
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you, Mr Murphy.
Tuesday:
No one wishes to speak against.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
Tuesday:
As democrats, we accept that.
It is an important part of our work.
We shall now proceed with two votes:
(Parliament gave its assent)
Wednesday:
Thursday:
(Parliament gave its assent)
(Parliament gave its assent)
That finalises the agenda.
Speeches on points of order
That is the good news.
His name was Joseba Andoni Urdaniz.
Two people were killed.
(The President cut off the speaker)
So she is a little behind the times.
That would be just as erroneous.
He makes two points.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Article 4(3) is of crucial importance.
In addition, the UEFA has a major role.
We can, of course, defeat hooliganism.
And then, what about the others?
What about the non-candidate countries?
This is not so, as you well know.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
Sadly, that is not the case.
That is the first point.
Cooperation is the key to success.
It is a necessary measure.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the joint debate on:
That must come to an end.
Such concerns are groundless.
None of these things is envisaged.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
.
There is your answer.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The next item is the joint debate on:

These are serious, practical problems.
The debate is closed.
Thank you very much, Mrs Klamt.
The Commission proposal is a brave one.
The most important innovations are:
Thank you for your cooperation.
That was not to be the case.
What was lacking was a common approach.
These are people we are dealing with!
It may be a country they have heard of.
It might offer work opportunities.
There might be a language link.
There are all sorts of reasons.
What is the nuclear family?
The debate is closed.
Are there any comments?
I should like this put on record.
Thank you, Mr Wynn.
We were the lucky ones.
We shall notify the French Government.
(The Minutes were approved)
Mrs Frahm, you asked to take the floor.
That figure requires some explanation.
So, there was a problem.
We have failed to do that so far.
It borrowed and lent money.
Its credit balance exceeds its debts.
That is only reasonable.
That would seem to be a large number.
Parliament can endorse their opinion.
.
We grant discharge to the Ombudsman.
This situation is a disgrace.
Your criticism is one that I share.
They were on the spot themselves.
We need to be able to indicate that.
So we have a double problem there.
These we have to sort out ourselves.
It is a step that we must take.
This is not the right approach.
This is the seventh year running.
This is not a record to be proud of.
The buck stops with the Commission.
Things have got to change.
There are still some problems, however.
So it is relevant to refer to this.

Let me emphasise that again.
How, then, is that to be done?
This was agreed in Berlin.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
This is a key point for us too.
We do, of course, support this idea.
That is our objective.
We have already waited too long.
It is a powerful symbol.
The Commission does not object to this.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
It is in Amendment No 15(1)(d).
Why?
Thank you very much.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Schmitt report (A5-0093/2002)
Ebner (PPE-DE).
President.
Otherwise, the report is excellent.

.
I am pleased that Amendment No 21 did.
.
.
Support refugees!
The majority was fortunately rejected.
.
.
That concludes voting time.
This is not a minor point.
I was not able to do that.
That is an important contribution.



Thank you very much, Mr President.
This is true also of arms policy.

We are ready to play our part as I say.
It is not always easy.
These problems are not insoluble.
Hands up!
We must not switch roles.
The cooperation model is paramount.
This is untenable in the long run.
Gentlemen, a warm welcome to you.
Thank you.
My group has another vision for Europe.
We want the Commission to move forward.
Why only a third?
We need somebody with responsibility.
Every military conflict has a history.
You touched on this point, Minister.
But there is wastage.
I support those broad objectives.
Quite right!
So progress is being made.
That goes without saying.
I am not sure what.
You ask about relations with NATO.
Secondly, missions.
I am very happy to do so.
That concludes the joint debate.
(Loud applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
We will organise the detail of that.
How have we come to this?
Wrong always, wrong everywhere!
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
(Applause)
(Loud and sustained applause)
The killing must end immediately.
(Applause)
The West does have levers of pressure.
You, Mr Solana, must employ them.
(Applause)
They expect so much from Europe.
They are pinning all their hopes on us.
We must make some genuine proposals.
We would always greet one another.
'Kiffech' he would say to me.
'Mapsuta' I would reply.
Are these normal scenes of war?
We must not lose our humanity.
The tragedy is two-fold.
I am not taking sides.
Few tears are shed for them.
That is all well and good.
There can be no such balance.
What can we do?
A great deal, I believe.
Let me quote:
The EU too must do more, however.
An immediate weapons embargo?
Yes.
The Oslo spirit is dead.
Israel is guilty of state terrorism.
We should take advantage of that.
I wish you all every success tomorrow.
Words alone, however, are not enough!
This is the only option we have left.
We need to make demands of both sides.
The situation was desperate then.
But I hold no brief for Ariel Sharon.
Time is running out.
Mr President, time is running out.
You know what I mean.
I repeat: without delay.
That is what we must do.
That is the final objective.
How can that objective be achieved?
(Applause)
(Applause)
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.

The rapporteur has been very cautious.
The debate is closed.
I believe we have achieved this.
Nevertheless, it is a good result.
I regard that as a good proposal.
That would be a great pity.
The Union should pay for that.
He has a UK patent.
This is one of our priorities.
So what is the current situation?
Finally, jurisdiction.


This is a compromise solution.
Here two different issues are involved.
That is the first issue.
That already exists.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The answer is relatively simple.
There is then no third-party control.
That just cannot be right.
I hope that you will agree with me.
Thank you very much, Mr Florenz.
I cannot do anything about it either!
No, we are not.
No, we do not.
Yes, in all probability they will.
Not yet.
No, the amendments ignore them.
No.
I must say, I am not in favour of this.
Thank you, Mr President.
This is modern environmental policy.
This is new.
Individual producer responsibility.
That does not work.
Thank you, Mr President.
I support the thrust of his approach.
Otherwise we will simply have chaos.
One final word about Finland.
Why should this not be visible?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
This is an interesting issue.
We want this issue resolved.
For the moment it is an open question.
So how quickly is it prepared to act?
The debate is closed.
The two hydrogens need to be deleted.
(The sitting was closed at 11.37 p.m.)
Situation in Chechnya
There should be no doubt about this.
More must be done here.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
This would be all too simplistic.
We will go together.
Terrorists do not fall from the sky.
What did we ultimately see?
This is a disaster which we are facing.
It is not like that in this case.
We should make it our concern.
This war must end.
Mr President, I agree with Mr Cashman.
(Applause)
A change of thinking is required.
We should support this.
We need to trust both sides.
They are systematic.
We must not stand for this any longer.
This is not a war on terrorism.
We are both members of the OSCE.
This is all propaganda.
No one is investigating these crimes.
We must not stand for this any longer!
Thank you, Commissioner.
I will now comment on the amendments.

Thirdly, we need a human rights policy.
They then fail to find work.
It has the resources that are needed.
The bombings and killings must stop.
So what is the way ahead?
Economically, signs are encouraging.
We are catching up.
The debate is closed.
Mr Esteve, you asked for the floor.
.
We shall now take the next item.
Under-development is no excuse here.
Certainly we can be cautious.
This also applies to the death penalty.
Instability would be the result.
Thank you very much, Mr Belder.
I do not think that is acceptable.
This is Amendment No 4.
.
Thank you, Mr Blak.
Amendment No 41:
We went along with that.
.
So let us move to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)

1.
2.
3.
.
This is merely a pretext, however.
I am very pleased with that.
Hence our opposition.
.
.
.
.
This is genocide.
Stop this hypocrisy!

We must act quickly.

There is no reason not to be fair.
A cease-fire must be declared.

By no means.
And there are a lot of them!
It is a really good piece of work.
That will continue.
That is not acceptable.
This would not be the first time.
This situation is ridiculous.
This is unacceptable.
We do not support this.
We condemn this behaviour.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo.
Pensions are one example of these.
That applies to men and women alike.
This too must be borne in mind.
Do something, Council!
This is really the limit.
That is maybe cynical if truthful.
That would be irresponsible.
New resources must therefore be found.
The report certainly has good points.
How should this be done?
But we have given that commitment.
But that alone is not enough.
No, that is not enough.
Are there democratic lacunae?
Indeed there are!
Indeed there is!
The debate is closed.
Work always entails a risk.
No situation is free from risk.
Working with asbestos can be dangerous.
I should like to be very clear.
I appeal to the Commissioner on this.
I am entirely in favour of the report.
The evidence is there.
That is at any event what I have heard.
Yet this committee knows better.

This is not very responsible.
That too I see as being necessary.
The debate is closed.
You have the floor.
Could I ask if that is the situation?
Let us show some optimism for once.
You have the floor, Mr De Rossa.
Subject: Concept of marriage in the EU
Mr de Miguel has the floor.
The Council cannot give an answer.
I am interested and I do know it.
Subject: Peace in the Middle East

I also think the time is just right.
Subject: Kashmir
Subject: Extension of scope of SIS 2

This is not a point of order.
Mrs Izquierdo should be aware of this.
The first is market fragmentation.
There have been such failures.
Who is making those judgments?
Are the rules on depreciation right?
Perhaps I may mention four of them.
We do not want to see that happen.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The EU is in the process of enlarging.
We have kicked the ball back.
Mrs Jeggle has pointed this out.
So this sixth attempt is a real loss.
Please do not misunderstand me.
The Commission is working on that.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
Protection of minors and human dignity
I commend the report to the House.
For them, we need money.
That is the basic premise.
I see this as compellingly necessary.
I have seen the pictures.
Abuse is under-reported.
So what should we do in the EU?
We need to do more.
So many thanks for it.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
The challenges we face are great.
For that, we need more mobility.
The US is still far more appealing.
My final point is languages.
This has set things moving.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
That is a cop-out.
However, that is not the case today.
We will now proceed to the vote.
Simplified procedure:
Before the vote:
Thank you, Commissioner.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
.
.
There must be room for manoeuvre.
.
.
.
.
The opposite is now true.
.
The word 'support' may cause confusion.
This would have been more than enough.

Everyone is aware of this.
.
.
.
.
.
Moldova needs a new future.
We must act, and act together.
We find them unacceptable.
The joint debate is closed.

The joint debate is closed.
Violation of human rights in Nigeria
Human rights situation in Guatemala
Channel Tunnel
A vicious circle indeed.
Such is the situation in Vietnam.
That is the Commission's position.

That is the first measure.
This situation is unacceptable.
They are perfectly justified.
This is unacceptable.
What exactly are we talking about here?
What does this document say?
These are desperate people.
The joint debate is closed.
The very best of luck, Angola!
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Their position is deplorable.

The joint debate is closed.
.
Resumption of the session
The next item is the order of business
Thank you very much, Mr President.
What are these principles?
(Applause)
Much remains to be done.
There is also a broader point.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
I want to make four points:
(Applause)
(Applause)
.
(Laughter and loud applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
This must stop.
(Applause)
(Sustained applause)
(Applause)
That is what we have called for.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We must be a bit more decisive.
Our partners must give us guarantees.
(Applause)
That is paradoxical, in my view.
What can we do?
I am asking a very simple question.
Are we not hypocrites?
Is that not the truth?
This was both fair and unfair.
We can do this immediately.
This is true.
(Applause)
To achieve peace, we must do more.
And why not?
This is one option.
Are we doing enough?
We must grasp this once and for all.
(Applause)
This applies to both sides.
(Applause)
This is what I am saying.
(Applause)
We do not know what happened to them.
I can fully endorse this view.
Domine dona nobis pacem.
[Grant us peace, Lord].

(Interruption by the President)
Mr Larsson is entirely right.
The Sharon regime must be isolated.
We know what we are asking Israel.
And what a vision this is!
That must be stopped.
It is not just a question of Jenin.
The horror is also political.
Wealth next to misery.
We know how many of them are children.
Marriages are not being registered.
I hope we do not.
He does not take them seriously!
They play into Ariel Sharon's hands.
They harbour anti-Semitic ideas.
And what will the upshot be?
Have you ever checked up on it?
Can you give Parliament evidence of it?
The violence and the killing must stop.
I do not think so.
Hardly.
Who is it who have to suffer?
Is this information correct?
What do you mean by that?
I say 'excessive' caution.
I appeal for urgent aid in that regard.
I have no doubt about that at all.
Does this Parliament want such a bank?
Do certain members of the Council?
Are we seeing history repeat itself?
How can the EU help?
We have been gagged for all this time.
They want peace now.
What do I find most disturbing?
I am also a candid friend of Israel.
Our task is one of persuasion.
The debate is closed.
Thank you very much, Mr Alyssandrakis.
Our decision was unanimous.
Why?
Why?
At the same time, what happens?
We need to be global.
We need to be expansive.
That is the reality.
What is such a bureau meant to do?
What mandate is it to have?
We must speak with one voice.
It is just empty talk.
We have not done that.
This initiative has been a success.
We speak of 'the rights of man'.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Slavery is not a thing of the past.
This is not true.
The debate is closed.
It was the Costa Neves report.
So I am the in-between bit.
As I said SAB 3 is coming.
There are other consequences.
They are right.
We will have a very rapid cut-off.
(Interruption: Very good!)
The debate is closed.
We are nowhere near approaching that.
My group will support the report.
I think that this is our future.
We know that it is very difficult.

However, we need to do more.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
We have done the right thing.
We shall remember that pledge.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Why is that the case?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11 p.m.)
Fishing fleets
This is worrying and must be rectified.
Which countries exceed their quotas?
This is unacceptable.
I accept your eighth point as well.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
This is not realistic.
(Applause from the left)
They want refugee status.
We need measures to combat misuse.
That we do not want!
That is not the policy that we support.
We do not want more Le Pens in Europe.
My second point concerns education.
This is of major importance.
We may get another chance.
Precisely the opposite is the case.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(Applause from the right)
Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you, Mrs Terr√≥n i Cus√≠.
We shall do as you have asked.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
The next item is the joint debate on:

The United States gives USD 10 billion.
How do you intend to accomplish this?
What a paradox this is!
We must, therefore, cancel this debt.
We no longer have surplus mountains.
What we have is balanced production.
Thank you, Commissioner.
.
.

.
This approach receives my support.
.
This paragraph read as follows:
- (NL) Europe is wealthy and powerful.
Mr President, last night I had a dream.
.
.
.
That concludes the votes.
Resumption of the session
President.
They were given very severe sentences.
I shall do that on behalf of the House.
Perhaps you could let me know.
(Applause)
The Minutes will so record.
Does that make everything shipshape?
Unfortunately not yet.
This too will need to be provided for.
This is a key point.
The debate is closed.
Terrorism has taken on a new dimension.
We have a counter-example.
That is simply not on.
These have a preventive effect.
Exceptions should be kept to a minimum.
It is important.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The directive applies to all consumers.
But what do we find?
It is not satisfactory.
Why?
And I would ask you to bear with me.
This happened in 1995.
We voted in favour of this.
Why maximum harmonisation?
What transpired?
Do consumers read the information?
Do they take it on board?
Do they understand it?
Among these, Article 3(4) is central.
Thank you for your attention.
Good.
The debate is closed.
This is a huge step forward in my view.

This is a step in the right direction.
That is not acceptable.
It is a false flexibility.
New types of employment are emerging.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

Tourism contributes 5% of the EU's GDP.


What are their reasons for this?
Tourism is important for growth.
The same, I imagine.
You would have put health first.

Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Such a thing cannot be had for free.
Top jobs are mainly held by men.

The ball is now in the Council's court.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
So there is sport in Europe.
So there is sport in Europe.
I thought this was a brilliant idea.
The Council is against it.
The galleries are empty.
Discussion must range far and wide.
We should take it as our example.
Sport is movement!
Maybe this is overrating it a little.
No one should be excluded.

Let us hope so!
Why was it successful?
It enabled us to make progress.
Thank you for your help.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 9.40 p.m.)
Are there any comments?


(The Minutes were approved)
I therefore put the motion to the vote.
We wish him every success.
Thank you, Mr Karas.
The debate is closed.
I am extremely pleased about that.
Member States must do the rest.
It is their responsibility.
The European Union is doing its part.
My last point concerns ethics.
This will not happen again.
We must not disappoint them.
The next point relates to health.
We must continue with these efforts.
The debate is closed.
Thank you very much!
(Applause)
.
That is, in fact, progress.
Let us begin this discussion in time.
.
This sum amounts to EUR 51 million.
How will we fund measures to tackle it?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.








This is our fundamental dilemma.
The reforms need to be speeded up.
A mistake has been made.
Before the vote:
I ask colleagues to approve it.
.
We have come a long way since then.
The fight goes on.
.
.
Why is that?
.
.
It is written on many clocks.

.
.
.
.
.
.
Well, I had another dream last night.
So do I.
We make ourselves a laughing-stock.
It is a question of political dignity.
Obviously, changes need to be made.
That means that we must make savings.
It leads to inefficiency and waste.
I would like to ask you what they are.
It is one we would do well to consider.
(Applause from the public galleries)
That is something we do not want!
That is something we do not need!
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
Those were my initial comments.
Thank you, Minister.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the joint debate on
But what about content?
My answer is yes, albeit slowly.
Our position remains simple and clear.
I want to make one final, simple point.
There is no other sensible option.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Thank you very much indeed!
Thank you very much, Erika!
(Applause)
Thank you, Mrs Hoff.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We are waiting for results.
How is this possible, Mr Migu√©lez?
I do not understand.
Business as usual.
We have talked about the economy.
Kaliningrad is not Konigsberg any more.
The Presidency takes the same view.
Russia is now our neighbour.
, Council.
Thank you very much, Mr Schulz.
Thank you very much.

Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Part I
I applaud any such effort.
Our fishermen are suffering.
The first was about timetabling.
That much is clear.
Subject: Child athletes

This is the general principle.
Second part
Questions to Commissioner Schreyer
Thank you very much, Mrs Schreyer.
Questions to Commissioner Busquin
At least, this is how I understood it.
I thank him for his response.
This is absolutely essential.
It is very important.
These are problems for society.
Thank you, Mr Busquin.
Questions to Commissioner Verheugen
But what are we doing?
We cannot speak for them.
Subject: Cyprus
.
We are not refusing to trade.
.
That was my specific question.
Every word I used was important.
Subject: Benes Decree of 19 May 1945
So why not in the EU?
I think that is worth considering.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I shall make two points.
The joint debate is closed.
This seems utterly unrealistic.
Very much the opposite in fact.
We do not need more complexity.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The joint debate is closed.
.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Otherwise, I applaud her remarks also.
This dossier has progressed quickly.
I will start with comitology.
The joint debate is closed.
This was by no means an absurd request.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)
Thank you, President-in-Office.
The next item is the joint debate on:
and
We in Europe do not have that feeling.
What then are the concerns?
My report is very clear on this.
Secondly, economic concerns.
What then should we do?
What does this mean?
The consequences are considerable.
The question is: what can we do?
How can we do that?
The war on terrorism comes first.
What does this mean in concrete terms?
These questions remain unanswered.

(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off.)
There is a challenge here for us.
Parliament has a modest role to play.

Therein lies our weakness, however.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the vote.
Amendment No 1:

Thank you all!
(Loud applause)
We will now continue with the vote.
We thank you for your visit.
I give you the floor, Mr President.
(Loud applause)
We disagree.

This is not his problem.

That is unacceptable.
Report Caudron (A5-0153/2002)
But what are we searching for?
That too is research.
.
I have voted against the report.
Why is that?
Because they have gone to lunch.
Why should we always eat them?
.
.
.
How can it resolve these problems?
That is not true, as we are all aware.
We do not share this view.
It is clearly the logic of the nations.
But which is the more powerful?
In other words, more of the same!
.
That is why I have abstained.
However, there are some hopeful signs.
Yet the accusation is extremely unfair.
Violence is no solution.
A few words about the conference.
This is not the first conference.
What should our point of departure be?
There is no agreement here.
We must not be racist.
Let us therefore get to work.
That is what we are trying to do.
They will all be necessary.
It is not going to do so.
The debate is closed.
There are many formulae for solutions.
(Applause)
It would be best to be blunt here.
So how should we proceed?
It means that everyone is equal.
That is a matter for the Convention.
That is of fundamental importance.
That is also well and good.
They should do this properly.
I wish them good luck!
I am sure we would and I hope we would.
The debate is closed.
I am delighted with your response.
All of this must be done.
I could not agree with you more.
I was not entering into any debate.
I asked for plans and dates.
When shall we have this sort of policy?
Which countries are they?
Why do you refuse to name them?
Britain is doing so, and so is Denmark.
You must ask specific questions.
Subject: EU Recruitment Office
That is not really a question.
It is the speaker's opinion.
No, definitely not.
, Council.

In 2001, the network was set up.
What would be the language of command?

Thank you, Mr President.
Funded with European money, no less!


What were the arguments?
This is all I can say in this regard.
Bayer have equalised.
No-one is perfect.
Look at him, he even seems cheerful.
This report refutes those arguments.
They are quite limited but important.
Not at all.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is a very important point.
Why?

(Applause)
However, I do have some objections.
What are those objectives?
We must go further.
Let us try to spell it out.
Two brief comments.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That, at any rate, is what I am hoping.
We could have done more.
I believe there are some problems.
We might be expected to do a bit more.
The debate is closed.
What is different?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Let us remain mindful of this.
War is not a solution.
It draws up demands that are necessary.
There must be no war.
There is no doubt about that.
That is our greatest concern.
They want a new regime.
It is clear where the fault lies.
The debate is closed.
They were rigged.
That I do not believe!
We know that.
Hoxha was Hoxha and he was appalling.
That is why I share Mrs Pack's view.
The debate is closed.
Why do we need this initiative?
We accepted this ruling.
What are we working towards?
Let me give just one example of this.
I am one of the latter.
I would like to explain why.
Many thanks for listening.
Thirty seconds early: Happy Birthday!
And so say all of us.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)
Sustainable development
So I shall refrain from doing so.
So what should we be doing?
This is where the problems lie.
What does this mean?
Johannesburg has to deliver results.
Political priorities need to be set.
That is unsustainable.
This excellent report confirms that.
I think Johannesburg must start here.
There are two main reasons.
Poverty breeds population growth.
We had high expectations in those days.
However, there are good examples too.
I should like to make two points.
I look forward to your answer.
Rio was a milestone.
We have not even begun negotiating yet.
Global economy requires global rules.
This is not certain.
Here we need more than monitoring.
We need policing.
This has to be discussed.
I could not agree more.
This is needed.
Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
It contained general statements.
What should the Commission do?
I should like to make two other points.
I do not think so.
It is a fundamental human right.
These are the low points.
We have to be clear what we are facing.
I agree.
Once again, I could not agree more.
These are strong words.
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
(Loud applause)
English is the original text.
That means something different.
Mr President, I hope I am not too late.
I would vote against Amendment No 12.
It would contravene the Rules.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)

.
.
.
.
.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo.
.

This is no longer a policy ...
Let us hope so!
However, you are quite correct.
Here we have a different situation.
What is our responsibility as a result?
We could revolutionise the world.
We should not forget that.
I see that is not the case.
Is anyone else able or willing to rise?
No.
I agree completely.
I will come back to this.
We are very pleased with that.
However, reality can be different.
This has not always been the case.
This is the real bottleneck.
Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
We see that it is taking time.
I think that would be helpful for us.
We cannot always get it right.
That is a real problem.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.00 p.m.
We know that 5,000 Moluccans have died.
There was no trial, no sentence.
Who gave those orders?
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The findings were deeply worrying.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
So has the ACS-EU meeting.
What else could we do, in fact?
Mugabe appears to be unassailable.
There may also be another way.
How was it acquired? When?
Where did the money come from?
This is the way we normally do things.
How were they able to do that?
That is how it has to be done.
That may not be the case.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Resumption of the session
You are very welcome.
(Loud applause)
That is all I have to say.
Commissioner Fischler is most welcome.
(Applause)
... that is what I am saying!
Agreed?
Agreed!
(Laughter, applause)
We must have a proper investigation.
Which is why I shall say no more.
We call for a vote on our motion.
Mrs Kla√ü, your point is well made.
The whole incident was filmed.
Fishing capacity is going up, not down.
That is the main difference.
To my mind, this is regrettable.
(Applause)
(Applause)
The real problem is a social one.
They are in fact opposite things.
They cannot exist side by side.
Politics and fishing just do not mix.
With fish, we merely hunt them down.

Big mistake.
That is not conservationism.
This is not acceptable.
You have not done this.
His proposal goes beyond fishing.
I have a few critical comments to make.
That is just asking for trouble.
What is required here is a balance.
This is European policy..
Are we really at war, Mrs Figueiredo?
Are they not wanted?
Where does this leave the Community?
We have to make hard choices.
I look forward to the next six months.
For that, more time is needed.
This does not add up.
That is what everyone is saying.
This is a very pertinent question.
I do not like the route we took.
We all know that.
We might like to do so, but we cannot.
These figures come from your services.
That is the important thing.
But before I do, I have a request.
And we need to work together on that.
I fail to see that.
They have been for the last year.
Let us not get carried away here!
One tenth!
One thing stands, however.
If we ask ourselves, do we need reform?
(Applause)
What does this mean?
(The President cut off the speaker)
The debate is closed.
I am not criticising that.
And we shall do so.
I have my doubts.
There are limits to consumerism.
This is a reasonable compromise.
I do not believe that this is true.
Not now, not ever.
It is crucial.
It should not be.
This is a widening of choice.
Stick to it!
For that too I am most grateful to you.
We must not let them down.
Maybe that also applies to Parliament.
That the money we budget be disbursed.
All this deserves to be discussed.

This is no easy task, however.
So I removed all that.

Thank you very much, Commissioner.
On that much we can agree.
We have conceded something in advance.
The debate is closed.
Modulation has thus far been voluntary.
It is a perfectly good system.
I will close with one last point.
This is not the role of the CAP either.
I think they can.
The European farmers deserve better.
The interim review is, therefore, key.
So it is not a socially just policy.
And new ideas are exactly what we need!
But just what does society expect?
Just the opposite, in fact.
Thank you Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.


On unsolicited commercial e-mails.
But no!
And why?
In order to reach a compromise?
No, we do not!
If you don't like them, I have others?.
Mr President, it is very sad.
Citizens have reason to be worried.
This is quite a while ago now.
First of all, opt-in, opt-out.
Let me put this on the record.
But there is no war.
We have tried.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
All these are very important.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Interested in what, and why, I wonder?
Why am I so concerned about this?
It clearly needs to be improved.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We recognise that this is not easy.
We hope that we will succeed in this.
It is an action programme.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
That is not acceptable.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
It is now time for clear-cut action!
Commissioner, let us not be too late.
What are we in Europe doing?
Why?
Thank you Commissioner.
Are there any comments?
The risk of shortages is quite small.
That is right and proper.
There is a need to catch up here.
Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The second problem is that of funding.
Mr President, this is beyond me.
This is also unacceptable, in my view.
The Iron Rhine is one such case.
(The President cut the speaker off.)
Thank you, Mrs De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
We must and should encourage both.
The EU must follow suit.
We hope that will be taken up.
We live in a different world.
This we must change.
The crucial thing is transparency.
This is a purely economic concept.


What does this mean?




Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
My group supports this position.

Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Mrs Frassoni.
Parliament is now fully informed.
A question remains unanswered.
This is the problem.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Mrs Korhola also wishes to speak.
The plenary has taken note of that.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)

Absolutely!
This is due to an oversight.
I ask you to take note of this.
That has been noted, Mrs Peijs.
I have voted against this paragraph.
Therefore I have voted against.
Why did I vote for it?

.
This is left to the Member States.
.
.
Here's to environmental information!
How could I vote against the directive?
This is why I voted for it gladly.
.
in writing.
What type of thieves, Madam President?
How can I explain why?
I dreamt that I had become a VIP.
.
.
.
.
1.
2.
That is why we abstained.
.
What do we find?
These are not welcome.
Thank you, Mrs Doyle.
.
This clearly has not happened.
It makes your mouth water even more!
Yet the situation continues to worsen.
.
The Commission's approach is correct.
.
.
Thank you, Mr Purvis.
Resumption of the session
We now move to the order of business.
This is what we are about to vote on.
I am told we will not have hot water.
I decided that of course I should come.
We are all familiar with this subject.
Please do not interrupt.
(Applause)
There are two points here.
What have been its findings?
That is an important distinction.
The following are my requests of you:
I know that you knew that already.
Over 80 of them are not controversial.
That would enliven our proceedings.
If it does work we can continue.
Why not try out something new?
See if it works.
Those will be put to the House.
It did not happen.
Please support the Corbett report.
This then resulted in a complaint.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is absolutely imperative.
A real parliament, in other words.
This is often a disgrace in my view.
We will see what happens tomorrow.
Why is this so?
This proposal has two snags.
And everything is in keeping with this.
I fail to see the connection.
Then there is the language issue.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
This evening's debate confirms this.
This solution seems to be reasonable.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut the speaker off)
Is it even 'What You Will'?
Surely not.
They do not.
Well done!
Why not?
What are we ourselves afraid of?
Of people actually watching us?
It cannot be that.
Is that what you want?
(Applause)
I will focus on the criticisms.
How do we define less controversial?
But let the onus be that way around.
Even then it is not obligatory.
That is a very reasonable compromise.
There is no harm in trying it out.
Thank you very much, Mrs De Palacio.
The debate is closed.

Thank you very much.
The joint debate is closed.
However, it is not enough.
This applies all the more to women.
No, that is not the case.
This is all possible.
This is sometimes overlooked by many.
This is impossible.
We must not overlook that either.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Member States can also impose fines.
I hope the House will support them.
That brings me to my final point.
This is not the case.
Unfortunately this is not it.
Our group has tabled two amendments.
This proposal is one of many.
The policy must be adapted accordingly.
We will support it accordingly.
That is the objective.
We have done our homework.
No one can have the sky to himself.
It must therefore also be rejected.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Mr Mastorakis.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Vote on request for urgent procedure
This is unsatisfactory.
The next item is the joint debate on:
The question of Tunisia still remains.
The gulf is widening.
That, I think, is a major shortcoming.
That point was made again at Valencia.
Unfortunately he is on mission today.
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
That is the way we want it.
What do we want to achieve here today?
What do we want in addition to that?
I hope that I will also have yours.

We cannot afford further delays.
This is unacceptable.
There is a legal precedent.
The consumer has a right to know this.
That is in itself something positive.
I thank you for your attention.
It appears that we still do.
The sooner the better.
At the earliest opportunity.
What they are is never spoken aloud.
We are tired of waiting on this issue.
We want to bring that to an end.
We need safe cosmetic products.
It is you who have prevented it!
What do you take us for?
This is stupid and unnecessary.
The debate is closed.
He asked for subsidiarity a moment ago.
I will not tolerate this approach.
That is not the key issue.
The human body is not a commodity.
Self-sufficiency has to be a goal.
I am not alone in saying that.
Indeed, some people could even die.
There is something else.
The debate is closed.
Does that include snails?
The debate is closed.
The next item is the vote.
You have made a formal proposal.
I will follow the due procedure.

.
How many more new products do we need?
We know that that is not the solution.
The solution is regulation by the law.
.
.
.
Now we need to bring it to life.
.
I see Mr Fatuzzo is present.
Either way it has been a long process.
That is what is being done.
These efforts are doomed to fail.
This is unfortunate.
This has not been achieved.
Why?
So congratulations.
You have my full support.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
Now is the time for leadership.
That much is obvious.
We must strike up a dialogue.
What are the real problems?
What was the opposition?
We are talking politics here.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Market access is a key issue.
Yet it all started so promisingly.
Council.
The debate is closed.
Thank you.
Why were the negotiations difficult?
I missed it.
Is it scheduled for later?
This is a very disturbing discovery.
Why is that?
No action has been taken, etc.

The FVO carried out this work.
They are not comparable in scale.
That is my position.
I have three questions to put to you.
I wish to put three questions:
This is now almost three weeks ago.
So you are not convincing me.
However, I have two specific questions.
Why did rapid alert not work?
This is my first question.
I would be interested to find out.
Mr President, that remains the case.
This has not been achieved.
A number of Members raised that point.
My services and I support that.
That is probably true.
I can only repeat what I said earlier.
The subject will not go away.
Sometimes they do fall into traps.
The debate is closed.
Part I
These are the facts.
Question No 1 by Roy Perry (H-0387/02):
"The Commission is reviewing it."
At the moment this is all I can say.
Subject: Cattle growth hormones
I fully agree with that.
We are then at sea without a compass.
However, it has not yet begun.
Part II
I shall respond to them all.
I am not going to interfere, however.
Subject: The Berlaymont Building
What are the current projected costs?
Negotiations are therefore continuing.
I will take questions 2 and 3 together.
There is no doubt about that.
Questions to Mr Liikanen
I am a loyal customer of question time.
I therefore prepare my questions.
I do not understand this.
This is how things stand.

Our scope is therefore limited.
Subject: Migration to an open API
There are three parts to the question.
I want to give two answers.
Why are so few prepared to take risks?
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
We take good note of your comments.
We thank Mr Liikanen.
Questions to Commissioner De Palacio
That is my supplementary question.
That is very important.
This is, in my view, a very good thing.
I thank the Commissioner.
But one thing puzzles me.

To do it, they will also need support.
The debate is closed.
This is what it is all about.
I have listed a number of points.
Thank you, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
We badly need them for all our futures.
That must be emphasised.
I support Mrs Zorba's conclusions.
It has not been solved yet.
Europe must become more innovative.
For what transpires?
Codecision with Parliament is excluded.
We really need to change this.
This is more than regrettable.
This is unacceptable.
Perhaps.
No.
I now turn to the individual reports.
Mr Mantovani, you also mentioned SMEs.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
.
.
.
This is what we expect from Seville.
(Applause)
Nothing new is being said.
Are there any higher offers?
These are not self-contained issues.
They are sometimes right.
This is the crucial thing!
The final issue is that of immigration.

What can be done about this?
This is not on the Council agenda.
We are in total chaos.
This is not on the Seville agenda.
Are you going to debate this?
That is not all, however.
We have to support these.
Casualties continue to rise.
The overwhelming message is clear.
This has now been created.
Who is calling this into question?
We must therefore combat it.
I want to get on with the vote.
(Loud applause)
(Loud applause)
We are here to vote.
A large number of people wish to speak.
I shall read it out to the rapporteur:
Mr President, Mr Wuermeling is right.
It appears to make sense to me.
Does the rapporteur agree?
.
I congratulate you once again.
.
.
.
.
.
This is just explanations of vote.
.

.

You are extremely welcome here.
So you are welcome and congratulations!
2002/2007(COS));



We cannot act in any other way.




I would like to join them in that call.
We have the best arguments on our side.
We are on schedule.
There is no point in denying it.
(Laughter, applause)
You just have to read Community law.
It is there in black and white.
Passed by unanimous agreement.
That will be a huge achievement.
(Interjection)
I can confirm what he said.
We are making very high demands.
We have known that for a long time.
But here too we must be honest.
(Applause)
There is no excuse for delays.
We cannot make additional demands.
I can even endorse them politically.
This is a key issue.
So now is not the time to stop.
We have to keep moving forward.
We are failing singularly to do that.
We failed.
We failed to carry out the reforms.
Our group also supports this position.
Timetables presuppose action.
The planning stage is over.
Let me cite Latvia as an example.
So if Latvia can do it, why can not we?
A Europe in which we feel at home.
Romania now stands at the crossroads.
We must take new initiatives.
Surely that is within our grasp.
In my view, this is unacceptable.
It will only rise by about 10%.
They need assistance urgently.
This is described in my report as well.
Until then, we must help them.

What can we say?
Of course, there are reasons for this.
We cannot accept it.
Let us try and make the best of it!
Fortunately, it did not do so.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We want a humane and just policy.
This is our question.
Many realise this.
That was difficult enough in itself.
This should be removed.
There are plenty of arguments.
We have no alternative.
That has already been pointed out.
We want it to be.
We hope it will be.
Cyprus must speak with one voice.
At the moment, the farmers are worried.
The project's success must be assured.
The report has many merits.
I will mention two examples.
They have a right to know.
Credit should be given to his efforts.
Tomorrow will be too late".
Let us look at individual countries.
I wish to draw attention to one matter.
Madam President, three points.
This you will have cause to regret.
That would not be so great.
There are precedents.
You only need to follow them.
And we are always ready to help you.
We have seen that before.
The buses could also be watched.
Would that be all right?
A bold step must be taken in 2004.
I do not see any contradiction here.
That is atrocious!
The main section relates to transport.
Cross-border trade is a necessary step.
Where has all this money gone?
It does not.
This should happen now.
ISPA is a case in point.
I call for reorganisation now.
We have to be very clear on this.
There are other forms of aid.
We must not forget these countries.
I think that is a very wise approach.
The timetable is an ambitious one.

I am convinced we shall succeed.
That is false.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
You are most welcome, Your Majesty.
(Applause)
(Applause)
You have all of these qualities.
In doing that you have touched so much.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
This is what I have to say to you.
Make of that what you will.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The Spanish constitution recognises it.
In fact, it is doing the opposite.
I have even seen the plants.
(The President cut the speaker off)
No, no, Mrs Lulling.
Excuse me, but that is not permitted.
A personal attack has been made on me.
The debate is closed.
What are this programme's objectives?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
I believe that is a wise approach.
It is not opposed to harmonisation.
It was not just a compliment.
The Commission supports this text.
The Commission cannot accept it.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The industry rejects them outright.
It is a complex approach.
We must vote against this amendment.
It is completely unacceptable.
This would lead to unfair competition.
Theirs is surely a policy of despair.
I have my doubts.
Safety is of paramount importance.
Fish swim.
Now!
She refers to that in her report.
Let me now comment on the amendments.
That advice is the advice of ICES.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
.
.
It was right to reject this proposal.
.
.
.
.
The case for safety is self-evident.
This process must be initiated now.
This has to be a concerted effort.
This is not a simple issue.

I support the rapporteur's motion.
This effort is therefore a welcome one.
It is, after all, a dynamic process.
This power must not be relinquished.
They must be speedily adopted.
We are taking only a first step.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
This is a worthy aspiration.
I should like to make three points.
We need to be as efficient as they are.
We now need to pursue that coherence.
Indeed, so should the Council.
It was not, however.
These are all political measures.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Internet technology is developing fast.
That is absolutely important.
Information must be available to all.
The number of old people is increasing.
Technical barriers must be removed.
Finances are not a barrier.
We therefore have to aspire to that.
If you did, did you feel the way I did?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
It is not acceptable.
It is high time something was done.
It cannot therefore be accepted.
(Laughter, applause)
There is something wrong with it.
It sparked the crisis in Kosovo.
Mr Sakellariou, it is very simple.
(Applause)
Let us stick to this text.
All other translations are incorrect.
We will carry out the necessary check.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
This should therefore be corrected.
.
.
.
.

.
.
The result is now clear for all to see.
.

What do we have to offer?
This is a sine qua non.
.
We heartily approve of such a move.
We cannot continue like this.
Let us not forget this.
.
.
.
That is incorrect.
.
.
.
.
.
.
We must prevent them.
.
.
.
That concludes voting time.
They too must fight these practices.
Why?
Adults at work, children in school.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
But I am left with questions.
Only Namibia has done something.
1.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Equatorial Guinea
Belarus (case of Andrew Carpenter)
Syria (case of Riad al Turk)
Malaysia
Equatorial Guinea
Quite the reverse, in fact.
The executions take place by hanging.
This too is to be welcomed.
That is deeply regrettable.
I am opposed to the death penalty.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
Captain Zidane definitely had not.
We also know what damage then ensues.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
Why?
I now turn to Nepal.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
recital ?:
I have voted against the report.
Resumption of the session
Thank you for your attention.
The debate is closed.
I personally believe that we should.
We are all working very hard on this.
So I shall say it for the record.
That is just nonsense.
That is the issue.
Are you prepared to support it?
So that is what we need.

Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
and
The first concerns language.
This is not its aim.
Thank you, Madam President.
We will support this at any rate.
Why do we demand this?
The same goes for fiscal incentives.
Innovation is inherent in it.
Do we want that as well?
If we do, then OK.
That should not be forgotten.
What, though does 'biological' mean?
Thank you, Mrs de Palacio.
The joint debate is closed.
The debate is closed.
Let me address just three of them.
I have listed only three points.
Yet, this is not sufficient.
I should like to make two points.
The question remains, however.
This is not enough, however.
The debate is closed.
Where, then, do the problems lie?
My comments?
These include the candidate countries.
Competition must not be distorted.
I shall now turn to Amendment No 10.
The debate is closed.
Budgets 2002 and 2003
The same applies to the RELEX reform.
This surplus is not a one-off.
This will also be the case next year.
If it was up to my group, we would.
Every year, we repay billions of euro.
Something is wrong here.
The third aspect is the CFSP.
That is a dilemma for us.
But category 5 is the big area.
The present system does not work.
My group absolutely opposes this.
Is it poor procedures?
Is it simply rigidity?
Not that much, then, one might think.
The debate is closed.
increase modernisation of the economy;
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is not a point of order.
(Interruption)
(Applause)
You spoke about the Convention.
(Applause)
That is the first thing.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
I thank it sincerely.
That is at least a start.
It is not one yet, however.
Congratulations!
Very good.
Come back down to earth, Mr Aznar!
In short, our leadership is flagging.
(Applause)
What a great idea!
Much has been said about them.
Bravo, Mr Aznar, well done!
It was right to do so.
We need better spending, Mr President.
None of these proposals were adopted.
It is above all a moral imperative.
I have one last question.
Firstly, legality.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
The next item is the vote.
Simplified procedure:
Before the vote:
.
Was I dreaming, Mr President?
.
That is why I voted for the motion.
.
.
Why did I mention Martini?
.
That is why I voted for the motion.
.
So whodunnit?
Maybe Mr Fatuzzo!
Why is that?
.
The ECB fully shares this view.
Thank you, Mr Duisenberg.
We support the two-pillar strategy.


(Applause from the right)
That is the way it should be!
This is a pragmatic institution.
This is a claim that we must verify.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, I shall make this brief.
Thank you again.
The debate is closed.
The proposal is totally impracticable.
One has to exercise excessive caution.
Lastly, ?
(The President cut the speaker off)
They become more resistant.
There is less environmental pollution.
We know that.
That goes without saying.
So why label it?
It smacks of selling out.
We have to continue to ask questions.
We have to think again.
Many people are concerned.
It is therefore unacceptable.
I consider this unacceptable.
It is next to lamentable.
They are particularly concerned.
Labels and traceability are one answer.
The jury is out.
A GM-free label has been talked about.
This debate will continue.
Allow me to mention three main points.
They are very wise, as so often.
It has been a voluntary activity.
How big is it?
How often will it meet?
Where will it meet?
How much will it cost?
Who is going to pay for it?
Can you fill out the detail?
Do you already have a ballpark figure?
The debate is closed.
Part I
Citizens must be aware of their rights.
Subject: The euro and bank charges

That is no longer possible.
I do not know his telephone number.
Part I
Questions to Commissioner Lamy
That is our position.
We favour Article 31 over Article 30.
None of them?
Thank you for your answer Commissioner.
Subject: 'Pesca√≠to Frito'
I love that part of Spain, as you know.
But back to the subject in hand.
We take exactly the same view here.
We have no legal authority to do so.
Perhaps I should do so straight away.
If so, how much money?
We have to abide by national laws here.
That is my question.
Subject: Tobacco cultivation
There are around 100 000 tobacco farms.
Why not 0.01%?
What does the consumer care about that?
The whole thing is a farce!
I have every confidence in you.

The first is the scope of the proposal.
Safety is not the issue here.
There is a good reason for this.
That is what the Commission is doing.
We have to live in the real world.
That is not correct.
They are two different situations.
The joint debate is closed.
The first one concerns the budget.
The debate is closed.
This is all too ridiculous.
Thank you, Madam President.
I will give you some examples.
I shall give you a couple of examples.
Thank you for the debate.
The debate is closed.
That is the job of the Member States.
So exactly what is this report about?

Very bizarre.
Statistics clearly bear this out.
What did those two conferences say?
That has nothing to do with rights.
That is called habeas corpus.
However, women will go where they can.
The numbers increase every year.
Why?
The answer is quite logical.


That concerns me greatly.
I do not consider it an abortifacient.
It is emergency contraception.
Let us stick to the facts.
I regret that.
Thank you, Mr President.

It is entirely unsatisfactory.
Why is that?
Thank you, Mrs Hermange.
Now Portuguese women travel to Spain.
Is this right? Is it sensible or fair?
This is clear from the Treaty.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
So what was important for us?
That is out of the question.
Why?
My thanks also to the rapporteur.
But it will not be easy.
Thank you again to all concerned.
Thank you Commissioner.
She is to be doubly congratulated.
The joint debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 a.m.)
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
That is a useful suggestion.
We have a new budget to pass.
The main headings of the programme are:
Fourthly: Safe food.
I welcome these decisions.
(Applause)
We want to work to secure safe food.
(Applause)
From Copenhagen to Copenhagen.
(Applause)
New tasks will then be pressing.
(Applause)
A good starting point has been created.
The time for speech-making has passed.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr President.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Then we will debate them.
We need openness; we need transparency.
(Applause)
That would be good for everybody.
That is the challenge facing you.
(Applause)
You are right to raise global security.
Thank you very much and good luck.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Europe is not yet 'one'.
This, I feel, is very sensible.
Difference should be respected.
I am proud both of Denmark and of you.
Enlargement overshadows all else.
I am convinced that it will succeed.
My first question is two-fold.
Now he is a Liberal.
What is really going on here?
Of course this is allowed.
Danes are, after all, a humble people.
Your priority is enlargement.
A good political decision - well done!
Why do I say that?
Only the USA now stands out against it.
The Commission has played its part.
It is in the acquis communautaire.
It has been an interesting addition.
.
I do not intend to go into that either.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause and laughter)
(Applause)
Farming incomes have already fallen.
We support you on your three issues.
We will work with you on that.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I believe you are clutching at straws.
Why be afraid of the Irish referendum?
But no funds have ever been committed.
We must step up a gear.
But what Europe, President-in-Office?
Secondly, Cyprus.
That is not so.
I would not dream of doing so.
(Applause)
(Applause)
I can see Denmark from my window.
That should give pause for thought.
We now come to the vote.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
(Laughter and applause)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That concludes the vote.
That is why I voted against the report.
But how could it be otherwise?
.
I am in favour of the 1% rule.
This too would be unenforceable.
.
.
.
We will now lead many consumers astray.
That is why I voted for it.
.
This problem too still needs solving.
.
Manipulation all the way.

.
Rights at whose expense?
Human life cannot be subject to voting.
Surely this is unacceptable!
.
We also point out that:
I have voted against this report.

That is how much they cared.
Where was the passion?
It cost millions.
And what a declaration!
What a message of hope for the hungry.
What a cop-out.
Think nothing, see nothing, do nothing.
We anxiously await that communication.
What actions were expected of us?
They all have to be fed.
Things could be different.
This is still the reality.
The figures are overwhelming.
We hope to move forward on this.
I agree.
It is coming.
This is not the case.
We are not moving forward empty-handed.
But the next step is Johannesburg.
The price tag is high.
Some things do work.
I have tried to clarify this issue.
It is a man-made and political issue.
That has to be kept in mind.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That is a policy we wish to continue.
This is very much welcomed.
But on one thing we stand firm.
Thank you, Commissioner.
It is outrageous.
Strict agreements?
Discipline?
Meanwhile, the questions are mounting.
It will only accept acolytes.
It is, quite simply, an empire.
And they will perhaps criticise Israel.

There are other problems.
What is the problem, then?
What does the US have to hide?
What criminals is it trying to protect?
We view the matter very seriously.
Thank you, Commissioner.

You have no chance of redress.
Yes, this is a true story.
This report is timely.
But let me sound a note of caution.
Some problems, nevertheless, persist.
It has all been too little, too late.
Our quarrel is not with them.
Therefore, more needs to be done.
The debate is closed.
Thank you very much.
You gave a very clear, excellent reply.
I have nothing further to add.
For better I hope of course.

Is there any news since Seville?

Subject: Georgia
My question also relates to Georgia.
This is a world first.


To put the question again?
Very good.
We thank Mrs Paulsen for this decision.
Welcome, President-in-Office.
It is a pleasure to see you.
Subject: UN special session on children


Consideration has been given to it.
Or let's take the case of Leyla Zana.

Anything I said would be subjective.
Matters must proceed properly.
I shall make a point of reading it.
Hence, these criteria and this list.

He has struggled with it as a lawyer.
I have seen these installations.
This is still not fully satisfactory.
I lay no blame on the Commission.
We do not want to let them down.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The debate is closed.
It is very timely legislation.
This is not the case today.
They are afraid to go out.
They feel threatened.
This is totally unacceptable.
This is unacceptable.
This is the example to follow.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The key word is the Internet.
There is far less focus on deeds.
That is something we cannot support.
What does the report do?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We cannot agree with these objections.
We therefore support it wholeheartedly.

This is not currently the case.
We need more competition.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I want to be very clear on this point.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
They are extremely slow growing.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The first is to do with delay.
The second relates to content.
This, Mr President, is a crucial point.
I will now continue in my own words.
That was how it put it.
Let us be clear about this.
The Commission welcomes this.
The debate is closed.
Gender equality programme (2001-2005)
We need to go further, however.
Only 23% of entrepreneurs are women.
I have been asked if I agree with it.
So it works at two levels.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Integration is being promoted.
I myself come into contact with this.

Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
So, what does this strategy involve?
Are we going to leave it at that?
Let us take just one example.
Where are they abusive?
When are they abusive?
This is an important point.
It is not work.
It is positive that this is being done.
I am grateful for this.
We must therefore put the pressure on.
My group tabled amendments to this end.
Regarding Amendment No 14:
The former is correct.
Joint motion for a resolution
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
1.
2.
We are mounting resistance.
1.
2.
But this is not the spirit of Nice.
.
.
.
It was looking back instead of forward.
.
.
.
.
.
1.
2.
3.
4.
I am sure others have too.
.
.
.
This applies to all aspects of the CFP.
.
.
.
.
That concludes voting time.
That is the main objective.
The Transitional Government?
I hope that they will be proven right.
I do not propose to go over them again.
This is something we must avoid.
I have no faith in these.
I call for open-ended negotiations.
That is what they need now.
Women are abused.
That is their choice.
They have elected governments.
on Angola.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
on Zimbabwe.
We should put pressure on them too.
Cows simply need to be milked.
That must not continue.
I have no hesitation in saying that.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Sentencing of Grigory Pasko (Russia)
Persecution of homosexuals (Egypt)
Freedom of the press (Belarus)
What did Grigory Pasko do?
We saw this at the NATO summit in Rome.
We see it in the OSCE.
This has nothing to do with reality.
What do we ask?
Look at me.
I am human.
I bleed.
I laugh. I cry.
Thank you, Mr President.
This problem has still not been solved.
Old times persist in Belarus.
This is on top of our own experiences.
A new strategy is required.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
We must help others to help themselves.
We utterly reject the joint resolution.
Now there is a need for reforms.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Resumption of the session
The following change has been proposed:
Wednesday:
There are no disagreements about this.
Thank you very much.
(The agenda was adopted)
I really do hope that you will do this.
I am gravely concerned about this.
I will check that.
But everybody stays silent.

It is absolutely repugnant.
That is how repugnant it is.
What he has said puts me in danger.
That concludes this item.
One effect is at any rate clear.
My third point concerns recycling.
My next point concerns re-use.
A final point concerns heavy metals.
How is that to be achieved?
We must be flexible.
The progress made is clear to see.
Let us see if we can improve them.
97% of our waste is landfilled.
It has had an incredible effect.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Much more needs to be done.
Since then, things have only got worse.
TRIPS must be implemented fairly.
I have just come from Johannesburg.
Who is he trying to kid?
We must listen to them.
This is a significant starting point.
This hypocrisy must stop.
It is a matter of power relations.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Much of it is genetically modified.
This would be disastrous.
This does not make sense.
This situation must be reviewed.
I sincerely thank Mr Stevenson.
This, however, is not the case at all.
Quite simply, this is unacceptable.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Why can we not provide solutions?
Why is that?
Second comes the issue of GMOs.
The debate is closed.
(Applause)
Announcement by the President
This cooperation is essential.
Thirdly, penalties.
We have made a step forward.
It is an ambitious proposal.
That would be harmful.
Safety must be the highest priority.
I shall try to explain what I mean.
The current system is far from perfect.
That is one way to do it.
That is against international rules.
This needs looking into.
But we are not there yet.
That is the real agenda.
Business is disrupted and delayed.
And that is not all.
This is also a very expensive system.
It is always the poor.
It is also vulnerable.
This is absurd!
We do not know.
Eurocontrol.
Privatisation.
There is no privatisation here.
Civil-military.
.
Day and night times vary.
Let us therefore introduce it.
There is a real need for harmonisation.
Thus far, the Directive makes sense.
Why is this so?

Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I hope those will be taken on board.
I would like to stress a few points.
Thank you very much.
Mr President, on a point of order.
We started this debate at 11.30 a.m..
(Loud applause)
That way, nothing can go wrong.'
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament approved the request)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
Mr President, I will be brief.
.
Mr President, I need a technician.
We know that we have no faulty Members.
It must be the machine.
President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
.
.
.
So packaging can serve some purpose!
.
.
.
.
What is needed is quite the opposite.
That is why we have voted against them.
.
This approach gets no support from me.
.
All well and good.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Many millions of people are affected.
We must all do our utmost to help.
Allow me to give just one example.
It has a purpose.
Many people are still missing.
I attached great importance to this.
(Applause)
The financial losses were colossal.
Three things are needed.
That is the question.
Something has happened to the climate.
I believe that that is the case.
Man-made climate change has arrived.
The time has come to demonstrate this.
Emergency help is urgently needed.
It was unprecedented.
Mrs Fiebiger has quoted the figures.

We have our work cut out for us.
And urgent help is needed.
But its job is not yet done.
What can we learn from this situation?
Our future is at stake.
It is important to act speedily.
Thank you Minister.
This measure is up and running.
This measure is also up and running.
This is the quickest method.
I think this too is highly significant.
Thank you for your support.
I was there on Thursday.
We do, however, have a responsibility.
That is the commitment I am giving.
Thank you Commissioner.
Particular care was taken
Thank you, Minister.
The Council cut this back slightly.
We welcome that.
Thank you for your attention.
But let me reiterate why we did so.
Let us be clear on our position.
Mr Wynn touched upon this.
That is unsustainable in the long term.
Thank you very much, Mr Stenmarck.
The debate is closed.
I have no doubt about that.
So there are two blocks.
Subject: Crohn's Disease
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Part two
Questions to Mr Bolkestein
Could you perhaps comment on that?
There is nothing wrong with that.
President.
Mr R√ºbig has asked one.
We are not.
Thank you.
Fine.
Thank you, Mr President.
That is a good thing.
Yes, and lack of time.
Questions to Mr Verheugen
I agree that I have said nothing new.
That is my question.
There must be a practical solution.
First Mr Crowley and then Mr Sepp√§nen.
Mr President, on a point of order.
On this occasion it is crucial.
I know that he asked to put a question.
Mr Crowley has the floor.
A yes or no answer will do.
How democratic is that?
I have taken note of his observations.
Subject: TEAM experts
They are organised in national groups.
Subject: Visa exemption for Macedonia
.
These criteria are not immutable.
Hence my question to you.
It is not simply better timing.
And for my second question.

I have a question on the timetable.
Can the Commissioner comment on this?
It is either five or one.


The debate is closed.
What is the point of this clause?
Absolutely no-one!
Thank you for listening.
That world has gone!
This is a crucial measure.
Are we to expect anything more?
If so, what?
Thank you Commissioner Bolkenstein.
The debate is closed.

That is also reflected in the report.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Everyone is in agreement.
Why?

Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
But it was an important advance.
It seems to me to be short-sighted.
I usually put forward Mrs Smet's view.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
.
.
Hence my vote in favour of this report.
Iraq
Malnutrition is generally more severe.
That is something quite specific.
Good!
We have a consensus.
(Applause)
(Applause)
He invaded Kuwait.
(Applause from the right)
You mentioned long-term sanctions.
These are counterproductive.
He drew a line in the sand.
That is your job.
There is also another point of view.
Quite remarkable!
That is the key issue for my group.
That is far more important.
But where is it?
(Applause from the right)
How long is this to continue?
These are today's friends.
It has come at an opportune time.
There must be no unilateral approach.
This proof must be clear and public.
Europe is playing a pivotal role.
I would ask for your support in this.
My second point is one of concern.
The EU voice must be heard.
We have stood silent.
We have first-hand evidence of that.
We have that evidence available.
What can we do?
This is a signal of solidarity.
We need to send the right message.
We almost made a mistake then.
There is no such thing as a clean war.
That is a genuine question.
Let us also be morally consistent.
I suppose that is better than nothing.
Mr President, Saddam Hussein is evil.
His regime is evil.
His deeds are evil.
What forward planning has there been?
This is the reality of the situation.
We know nothing.
Which position must they adopt?
We want peace in the Middle East.
We want a Palestinian State.
That goes without saying.
That needs to be made crystal clear.
That is a prerequisite.
What game are we playing?
After that only one alternative: war.
This is a major problem.
Do we think we should set an ultimatum?
Should this ultimatum be set by the UN?
Imperialism equates to war.
In our book, war is banned.
We are brushing all that aside today .
This is an enormous breach of the law.
The EU supports the UN's efforts.
Mr President, on a point of order.
It was a lapsus due to the Convention.
The debate is closed.
Afghan women played a striking role.
Afghan ownership is another code word.
I am sure we will not.
This brings me to my second point.
Let me give you a few examples.
He made this very point.
Of course it is not being contained.
Then, of course, women's rights.
So it is not easy.
Open your eyes, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you Dr Tannock.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
The rapporteur has asked for the floor.
I believe Mrs Villiers is in agreement.
.
.
.
.
Hence our vote against this report.
.
.
This is partly justified.
.
.
That concludes voting time.
There have indeed been changes.
This is madness.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(Applause on the right)
I agree entirely.
Many had to lose their lives.
Those tributes are wholly justified.
I want to make three other points.
The next item is the joint debate on:
The report is excellent.
This is no longer acceptable.
We are now a year on.
They are both interdependent.
Across the world?
This is the only way I can describe it.
His words inspire confidence.
Thank you very much, Mr Maaten.
The third is the problem of migration.
On that you have our support.
This has been achieved, however.
Let us consider Tibet.
Tibet has its own history and culture.
No longer is autonomy even mentioned.
Nuclear war has been threatened.
I should like to raise two points.
I will start on a critical note.
This problem cannot be addressed here.
We must not forget this country.
We managed to agree on all three.
This is a positive point.
I really do consider that important.
It is an excellent document.
I would strongly question that.
I have visited these refugee camps.
It therefore works.
One final word.
We need both of them!
Let me pick out a number of proposals.
That is an achievement in itself.
The debate is closed.
Subject: Separation of powers
If not, why not?
It will not be affected by any shadow.
How dare he reply like that.
What does he take us for?
We must protect democratic gatherings.
That is something we owe to democracy.
That is good, of course.
I cannot.
We are not going to start a debate now.
I very much regret that.
Several Members have asked to speak.
It is a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer.
My question follows that one.
Subject: Better regulation
This also falls under conclusion No 30.
Subject: Tackling Drugs
No, sorry, just a moment.
The question was from Mr Crowley.
Question No 16 has been withdrawn.
I can say no more.
Thank you, Mr President.
How shall we proceed in the future?
All this must be borne in mind.
The agency is indeed a success story.
That is certainly our approach.
We share this view.
The debate is closed.
Second: the lack of information.
Fifth: protection of the citizens.
Much, then, lies ahead of us.
We must improve this situation.

It seems to me that is a mistake.
All this is perfectly true.
That is a distortion of the truth.
I fully agree.
Moreover, that alone is not enough.
Here are some of them.
I turn now to access to justice.
Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.55 p.m.)
(Applause from the right)
Why should that be?
He is quite right.
So what can we change about the system?
Is that too much to ask?
No, it is not too much to ask!
I am grateful for that.
How often are they carried out?
Is there room for improvement?
They want it all.
I do not know.
It is down to the farmers.
Who monitors this?
Just looking certainly is not enough.
It will not help at all.
I shall say something about that.
Mr Mulder mentioned a quality mark.
Thank you Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
I shall outline them here very quickly.
My second point is funding.
That is something we can learn from .
This receives my warm support.
So we can learn from each other.
We should extend education centres.
That needs to be developed.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Perhaps we could use that in future.
Thank you, Commissioner Reding.
The debate is closed.
What are we asking for in the report?
They must be helped.
I would like to focus on sport.
I do not think it is.
These are all excellent initiatives.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
We wish her a very enjoyable stay.
.
.
This was never successful.
The report therefore has no purpose.
.
.
.
The other reason is economic interest.
.
This is no coincidence.
This is necessary but unsatisfactory.
.
.
.
.
The EU is playing with fire.
He should be released immediately.
There should be a fair appeal process.
We are friends of Egypt.
We must encourage dialogue.
The damage has been done.
We are in close touch with the family.
We can only agree with that.
The debate is closed.
Europe is opposed to the death penalty.
We must support their demands.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
This is a travesty.
That is the reality.
That really takes the biscuit!
That is the real background to this.
Was Europe really silent on this?
Mr President, just a few words.
That was the official reasoning.
I know Zimbabwe reasonably well.
The Commission deplores this.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 4.25 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
He is in Ireland on personal business.
The following change has been proposed:
Wednesday:
(The President cut the speaker off)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, on a point of order.
I hope so.
That is the lesson of the 20th Century!
(Applause from the right)
There is no resistance from Parliament.
That concludes this item.
That is not enough.
That is urgently needed.
I am sure we can find one.
We should draw some lessons from that.
This is deplorable.
All this is lacking at European level
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at noon tomorrow.
It is really two reports in one.
We want high standards.
We want best practice to be followed.
How, then, do matters look in reality?
The message is clear.
That is something with which I agree.
That strikes me as a futile exercise.
Moreover, it would not solve anything.

This is a true paradox.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at noon tomorrow.







In 1999, 250 million people did so.
It is a very good report.
Many thanks!
Let me start with victim support.
The debate is closed.
Such fat is particularly nauseating.
In the UK catering waste is banned.
This is all to the good.
This is a pretty repulsive habit.
Food traceability has been improved.
We must speed up the process.
What becomes of it then?
The outcome is a respectable one.
But not if it is sterilised.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.15 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
We have to focus on that.
I am, of course, being ironic.
Why is it such a problem?
Those are the goodies.
This must be included in the Protocol.
Would this increase the EU's deficit?
There is no other way.
We can never have too much safety.
I support this report in its entirety.
It was absolutely beautiful!
The area was called Bagnoli.
Even we have our uses.
That is the situation that applies.
Regular negotiations are under way.
Other areas have been clarified.
We cannot adopt that amendment.
Of course we are not.
I want to begin with a general comment.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at noon today.
Why, actually, do you want to do this?
We are already at the end of September.
We are not good little lambs!
This resolution makes that very clear.
Some of us are too.
They have been extended.
But what happens in the meantime?
That is what everyone is wondering.
I thank you for your support.
How more accommodating can one be?
Yes, I am happy to wait a moment.
That is what you have heard today.
Thank you.
That is the aim of this postponement.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Mr President.
The proof will be in the pudding.
This is the essence.
We know that a great deal goes wrong.
Why?
Fear of public access?
So that cannot be the stumbling block.
I am afraid that this is the case.
For this is desperately needed.
Why is this a State secret?
How much are they receiving?
For what purpose?
This makes no sense at all!
I cannot accept this, Commissioner!
This is very important.
The first one concerns the legal basis.
I have three points to make.
Its arguments are well known.
It is about all these things.
Let us get back to our cattle.
We will bring this issue up again.
These are key areas.
We need to crack this open.
That is what we are asking for.
This is a fact.
Surely that is impossible.
Thank you, Mr van Hulten.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the vote.
The rapporteur is Mr Mulder.
It is certainly not technical!
There is still much to do, though.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(Applause from the left)
(The President interrupted the speaker)
(Applause from the left)
I do not want to start a debate.
.
The European fleet has shrunk.
Fewer people want to become seafarers.
The EU has lost 40% of its sailors.
.
Hence our vote against the report.
.
.
It should remain this way.
.
Why is that?
.

This is a serious matter.
The same goes for its responsibility.
Why has this happened?
.
I have spent all my money.
Are there any comments?
Mr MacCormick has the floor.
Is that true?
What amounts do we need?
That is a temporary solution.
We need much more flexibility.
Enlargement has the highest priority.
That is what we call frontloading.
Allow me to mention just two.
My group welcomes this new procedure.
All this will need proper preparation.
Thank you for your attention.
It got a very good deal.
Allow me to make one final point.
Thank you, Mr President.
Will it have done so by 2003?
What are the deadlines for this work?
Thank you, Mr President.
Both, then, are to blame.
This is a good example, though.
My final point concerns B3-4106.
This is one reason.
Thank you, Commissioner Barnier.
However, we are not succeeding.
That is a very small sum indeed.
No change is required this year, then.
Why is this, Commissioner?
That is how it should be too.
Firstly, security and enlargement.
We are all open to that criticism.
That brings me back to cultural policy.
It is far too weak.
Is there to be a multi-annual plan?
That is why we proposed a new approach.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
We have two problems here.
So let's do our homework here first.
AIDS is a global problem.
Secondly, the quality of aid.
I look forward to hearing his response.
Secondly, we want more transparency.
The second issue is nuclear safety.
These are our priorities.
That would not be efficient.
We do not have a figure right now.

(Applause from the left)
Take Vietnam, for example.
A third example is nuclear safety.
We all understand why.
Can you give us your opinion on this?
What is your solution?
This is a high proportion.
Now to the issue of TACIS.
We are changing this gradually.
I could not agree more.
Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The other aspect concerns the Internet.
I ask for your support.
Employment is an important issue.
We would like to extend this list.
What does this mean in practice?
My proposal is, therefore, as follows.

I find this very disappointing.
What a daft idea!
Why?
That is a tragedy.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.

That is an urgent requirement.
You are familiar with the issues.
This is the EUR 27 million.
This too is a very important question.
Two events are particularly important.
We must not aim for the wrong target.
That should be enough!
The first is tobacco subsidies.
(The President cut the speaker off)
What are the costs of those options?
I am very pleased with this result.
Thank you for your attention.
In the main it has been successful.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Written declaration (Rule 120)
A few words on each of them.
Here, less is more!
The objective is positive.
Secondly, we must tackle congestion.
Let us not get carried away here.
For I cannot.
Let me briefly explain the position.
It must become much more effective.
This pattern must be broken.
My answer is clear and unambiguous.
That is an incredibly important issue.
The method is still in its infancy.


What will their scope be?
Last year there were 13 million.
What does this involve?
Agreed!
That would be wrong.
He has been very constructive.
Unemployment is still too high.
That must not happen.
What ought therefore to happen?
It is the correct path to go down.
That is not something we can support.
I will mention two.
This is an underdeveloped area.
I think this is urgently required.
What does it really mean?
the low level of training,
low productivity,
considerable regional inequalities.

I would like to focus on three points.
The third point is involvement.

Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I shall now turn to the report.
Women are underrepresented in these.
Hence the report.
Hence our theory.
So what can we do at European level?


Thank you very much, Mrs Bastos.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.48 p.m.)
.
.
This is why I voted against the report.
Detrimental with regard to agriculture.
The next item is the joint debate on:
We faced a great challenge.
These words must be turned into deeds.
I will mention five.
Not everybody gets everything.
I have noted some concerns here.
The negotiations were indeed difficult.
Doha dealt with trade in November 2001.
This helped Johannesburg succeed.
That is not a bad result.
That is what I will do.
Now a few words on follow-up.
We are not starting from scratch.
The EU must continue to take the lead.
So be it.
Transport remains the biggest problem.
I would put it on the negative side.
Have old objectives been confirmed?
Will we go into action worldwide?
It is high time we did!
It could have been worse.
These too are all firmly on the agenda.
This is beyond me.
We also have some criticism.
I shall not go into any more detail.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Do global summits still have a role?
Yes and no.
On a point of order, Mr President.
Now it is the turn of the MEPs!
There are already more than 1 200!
How much do we stand to gain?
Thirdly, a flagship is what is needed.
Fish stocks are to recover by 2015.
Now we have to get a move on.
It is not clear.
We must continue to resist it.
Most of this is carbon technology.
Now for the actual question.
We must create a wider support.
This balance was not struck.
That is a fact.
And why not?
Why was there a preventive approach?
What does this bode for the future?
Instead, nothing was done.
Why?
We can start with this in Europe.
Volkswagen is already doing this.
Another example is deforestation.
This is hardly a balance, therefore.
When will this happen?
So there is something included in that.
I have noted it.
So things are making progress.
Certain deadlines were set.
Now it is a matter of follow-up.
All this is quite positive.
We are moving into new terrain.
That is where we are.
This is not how it is in reality.
All that is now part of the Doha track.
We ended up with something acceptable.
This was an unwelcome drama.
I have covered some of the aspects.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
You are all very welcome to attend.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote:
I am sure the House will agree to that.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Report Smet (A5-0279/2002)
This is up to them and their members.
Tax is a matter for Member States.
.
The most important points are:
.
Unfortunately we do not.
The world has changed since 1950.
This is the pressing issue we now face.
.
This logically leads me on to Iraq.
The EU has fully supported this demand.
Now we have had these serious setbacks.
We all know that.
We must address its causes.
How much longer must this go on?
Thank you very much!
(Applause)
(Applause from the left)
I cannot comprehend this!
(Applause from the left)
This is its first argument.
They are stalked by poverty.
The parties must move forward.
The conflict must end.
This must be our resolve.
(Applause from the right)
We welcome that.
(Applause from the left)
Yes, when will it end?
(Applause from the left)
(The President cut the speaker off)
Europe's voice often cannot be heard.
You have proposed absolutely nothing!
I have read them in detail.
There is not a shred of evidence.
Why is that?
I urge you to excel yourself for once.
The choice is yours.
That must be our objective!
We should have acted earlier.
I disagree with this.
Does that mean we have no profile?
So what does that prove?
What are these general principles?
Parliament is right about this.
I really do not think so.
It cannot end in any other way.
This has been said quite clearly.
Thank you.
Stop this massacre!
You have the power to do so.
Rather, they are continuing.
So be it.
That is precisely our group's position.
We must get our own house in order.
I entirely agree with him.
The Council is working on a compromise.
This is where my group draws the line.
It will rather antagonise them.
The resolution is sufficiently clear.
This is less so for Europeans.
I have my doubts.
This is wrong!
There is a principle of subsidiarity.
That is of course the principle.
That is of course the crucial point.
That will not happen.
The answer is yes.
It would be foolish to do otherwise.
Let me make one final brief point.
I do not wish to repeat it all.
We should discuss this openly.
The problem is cultural and serious.
Mercosur has everything it needs.

We now talk about 10 ppm sulphur-free.
This is therefore regrettable.
I will support those higher standards.
That is what I oppose.
What do the people say?
Why do we not use common sense?
That is what I support.
The debate is closed.

Again it would be a barrier to trade.
This matter is important for us Finns.
Why is that?
Unfortunately this is not true.
There are 647 rivers.
It has to be anchored in reality.
The debate is closed.
That is my answer to the question.
However, I grasped the main points.
That is one of the reasons.
That is why we asked these questions.


I shall tell him what has changed.
What has that done?
So why should this be any different?
It is a circular argument.
That is obvious.
I accept Mr Mayer's apologies.
I do not accept that.

The Commission agrees with her view.
It is always willing to reconsider.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.35 p.m.)
He deserves his retirement!
I should like to mention some of them.
To my mind, it is already a year late.
I know that is the case.
Let us recall the delayed payments.
We have a lot to do in this area.
What is the way out?

There is a long way to go.
It cannot be restored.
I will end on a very personal note.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Fine.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is particularly important.
The Commission is wrong there.

Maintaining them would be suicidal.
What are these barriers?
First, capacity.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
(Applause)
.
.
.
We got rid of a wall in Europe.
.
.
.
Well, that is not the case.
How far is Europe prepared to go?
.
In the name of what is it doing so?

.
.
.
Hence our vote against.
.
What a paradox!
We say no to war.
.
.
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
How can we achieve this objective?
That is the point of this resolution.
We have mentioned a single standard.
We do not want to jump the gun.
I do not think it will come to that.
We need to meet each other half way.
That is far from the reality.
That is not realistic.
They are critical.
We are not there to do that.
What were the two core elements?
We really do need a deadline.
I do not qualify as an average person.

(Applause)
(Applause)
We shall now proceed to the vote.
I wanted to say it publicly.
That is too much!
Nonetheless, Mr Posselt is right.
(Applause)
(Protests from Mr Posselt)
And just what has been decided?
(Applause)
We have saved time.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Tribute
(Applause)
However, further efforts are needed.
Their achievements are extraordinary.
And to economic growth.
This is the task of the Convention.
(Applause)
It is their own decision.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Why did you do this without us?'
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause from the right)
We must never forget this!
Is there discrimination here?
(Applause)
(Applause)
Today is an historic occasion.
Some say enlargement is too costly.
But politics is not like that.
Enlargement and reform go side-by-side.
Today is not the end of a process.
Thank you Elvis!
One thing is clear, however.
This is in itself good news.
And there is the rub.
Quite the opposite.
I think that this is a mistake.
That is not the solution.
We need to talk about this.
How can that work?
Let us come now to enlargement.
Clearly, they need to reform.
Let us call a spade a spade.
That is why we are unable to progress.
That is the lesson to be learned.
Total social harmonisation.
Is that our dream?
(Applause)
We would welcome that.
(Applause)
Of course not.
Enlargement will continue.
This is a reason to rejoice.
Quite the reverse.
The principle is there.
Europe means talking to each other!
I have spoken of rifts.
That is our great opportunity.
This article applies to us all.
Credit where credit is due.
My apologies.
Welcome to a disciplinary Europe!
So much has been said.

That is genocide.
Nobody is fooled.
This much is clear.
Then let us make a start!
How are we to prevent this?
This must not be unilateral action.
It is not enough to threaten.
It is not too late to prevent this war.
Mr President, two minutes, six points.
He clearly intends to continue.
We are not pacifists.
The Iraqi Government agreed to this.
He maintains this condition.
Beware!
And just what does that mean?
What would happen then?
Obviously, this also applies to Israel.
He has other priorities.
The debate is closed.
That is hardly the way ahead.
We must look at the figures.
This needs to be investigated.
Will this produce any extra benefits?
This is my second question.
We often do much better than we think.
I also share the view as regards focus.
These issues are important.
We must have proper democratic control.
All of this is important.
I therefore welcome this proposal.
That is a practical question.
How can we sum this up?
Here are a few considerations.



We need to go further, however.
That is, and remains, the main task.
The debate is closed.
The next item is a joint debate on:
?
On this, I ask for your support!


Algeria also needs Europe.
That is the most important thing.
Europe therefore has a responsibility.
Consequently, it is what it is.
This has to be said!
Paramilitary groups.
This has to be written!
How can we accept this?
(The President cut the speaker off)
What does this mean?
All your amendments are misguided.
Well then, withdraw the rest!
We will all be happy!'
Why?
That is not our role.
Algeria has a single party tradition.
Let us adopt this resolution.
This work must have support.
France has the courage to do this.
This is the core of the problem.
Thank you, Commissioner.
This needs to be remedied.
We are building a Europe of solidarity.
How are we to avoid wasting it?
I invite you to reflect on the matter.
We should not be deceiving ourselves.
Mr Savary mentioned this earlier.
I certainly hope so.
The debate is closed.
Thank you very much, Mr President.

The debate is closed.
Where does that get us?
That is surely a credibility issue!
The prevention of fraud is nothing new.
Is that the big picture?
The debate is closed.
These nets should be banned.

I am therefore unwilling to accept it.

I can agree to Amendment No 10.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.42 p.m.)
Thank you, Mrs Hautala.
This should be taken care of.
Thirdly, the scheme must be effective.
We have a lot to learn.
It will not be easy.
We appreciate this very much.
Only four MEPs voted against.
I do not think so.
These emission allowances must lapse.

The Kyoto principle is simple.
The system must obviously be mandatory.
We cannot invent something new.
Every journey begins with a first step.
So much for my introductory remarks.
That is a massive amount.
I want to make the following points.
That is why it makes sense.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We govern, after all, by consent.
It must be flexible and market based.
It is necessary to remember this.
The debate is closed.
You are very welcome.


I will therefore confirm our position.
We cannot wait any longer.
We must push this report through.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.
The next item is the vote.
Is that correct?
Bosnia-Herzegovina is a special case.
.

I really regret this decision.
Hence our abstention from the vote.
Let things stay that way.
.
Why not use this directive?
Why not use the existing legislation?
Why, therefore, has nothing happened?
How can that be the case?
Resumption of the session
Tuesday
That starts the week on a good note.
What I have to say is simple.
(Applause)
(Applause)
I want to make this point even clearer.
(Applause)


It is a success for us all!
Today is one of them.
(Applause)
This is the current situation.
It is as follows.
Let us be clear.
(Applause from the left)
Let us stop being so hypocritical!
Let us continue!
(Applause)


We have one - the Commission!
I await your replies.
How is growth achieved?
That is a view that I share.
They are wrong!
Wrong!
What should it be about?
No, indeed not.
This is no surprise.
Booms are followed by recession.
That is the problem we are facing.
Parliament has made its suggestions.
I am sure you will agree with me.
I am sure that we all agree on this.
A currency is as strong as its economy.
This must be changed.


(Applause)
This is unacceptable.
Time is pressing.
I still have no reply.
rapporteur.
I commend the report to Parliament.
No human work is perfect.
So let us incorporate it.
I shall end with two brief comments.
The vision is clear enough.
The Charter is important.
I support the Charter.
This is something we should condemn.
This is not the case.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This, however, cannot be believed.
Sterling work was done at the time.
They must also become binding.
We cannot forget this.
I heartily congratulate both of them!
Paragraph 2 also concerns me.
The debate is closed.
Statement in writing (Rule 120)
Thank you, Mr President.
Why?
Let me turn now to the report.
That, though, is quite nonsensical.
That was the point of departure.
I have one point of criticism.
That is not all, however.
How many refugees, by the way?
We do not know.
The text gives no evaluation.
It is a mystery.
We do not know.
What are these differences?
We want the Geneva Convention retained.
We want the nuclear family.
This is essential.
This, at least, is our view.
We will support this report.
Let us be quite clear about this.
This is true.
The debate is closed.






The debate is closed.
I very much support that.
It lives!
Europe must help where it can.
(The President cut the speaker off)
You do not have any time left.
It was a misunderstanding.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 9.50 p.m.)
Medicinal products
Commissioner Liikanen has the floor.
Why?
Why is this so important?
How will this happen?
The procedure must be transparent.
This is a very positive point.
One is the authorisation procedure.
That is almost beyond our control.
.
I would like to raise three issues.
Mrs Read briefly covered one.
This is a hard balance to strike.
I see this as important.
Does a medicine have value-added?
Many medicines are toxic substances.
We should put a stop to this.
This is unacceptable.
Why is this?
(Applause from the right)
We must get the balance right.
Much has happened since then.
The same applies to Irish cattle.
We must be consistent here.
We have made mistakes here before.
Please be careful.
Think about that.
That is a very sensitive issue.
We are not proposing that.
It is clearly better for the consumer.
I just do not believe it.
The balance is not always easy.
That is not what we are proposing.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
Secondly, trade.
Thirdly, identification.
This has been a subject of some debate.
I cannot accept those arguments.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
President.
I have abstained for two reasons.
It is, after all, a petroleum product.
It makes you wonder ...
The suspense is excruciating.
Immigration is an asset.
.
.
Hence our vote against the report.
.
What did I see in this play?
.
.
That has nothing to do with this House.
.

That concludes voting time.
Section III - Commission
Section I - European Parliament
Section II - Council
Section IV - Court of Justice
Section V - Court of Auditors
Section VII - Committee of the Regions
Section VIII (A) - European Ombudsman
This is becoming a serious problem.
This is completely preposterous.
Heading 2: the Structural Funds.
It will be a 'memorandum item'.
I think this is absurd.
The budget ceiling is simply too low.
We will now postpone this by one year.
This is an excellent feeling.
It is a joint undertaking.
But that requires staff too, of course.
So thank you for your support.
That is a request that we have made.
0.3% for Germany!
These are long-term tasks.
Money needs to be earmarked for that.
It is hard to do all this.
Well done, Sweden!
Take agricultural policy, for example.
Which is right, of course.
We are a political forum, after all.
It concerns the funding for Kedo.
One such example is enlargement.
This worked out well.
This strikes us as highly improbable.
You are the Community's executive.
I am one of those who voted for it.
How much will enlargement cost?
That is the question.
Madam President, I will do what I can.
But only for institutional posts.
This situation must change.
It is also nostalgic.
However, we want to do even more.
This is crucial for enlargement too.
Employment depends on it.
This is, I believe, a historic act.
I see a further problem.
We are losing revenue.
We should do something about this.
This is the way it is.
The third point is the Celex budget.
These forecasts were dismissed.
Thank you for this contribution.
The debate is closed.
This is the good news.
There is some donor fatigue.
Who would not be?
So this is an issue of general concern.
Part II
Questions to Commissioner Schreyer
How are those licences actually used?
If not, why not?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Questions to Commissioner Vitorino
What steps can be taken to prevent it?
Subject: Combating paedophilia
Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Questions to Commissioner Byrne
Subject: Livestock markets
Subject: Food safety
Subject: Diabetes
I have high hopes for that programme.
Subject: Salmonella in marinated meat
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
C5-0591/2001 - 2001/0252(COD))
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Why uncharted territory?
Of course this paper is not perfect.
What is all this about?
That is the sad fact.
The task in hand is clear indeed.
(Interjection by Mr Bourlanges)
I have to say that we made a good team.
It is currently a political event.
We were at an impasse.
Mr Martin, I wish you good luck.
That is what started the whole process.
That is why this system is much better.
This is a good thing.
The debate is closed.
First, the lack of an action plan.
Again, we can be more definite.
The analysis is under way.
I support the report.

I hope that we can make progress.
The text is very clear.
This is in fact a dispute.
The cutbacks have to be made somewhere.
Health and safety cost money.
That is the reality of the situation.
I very much agree with all of that.
I agree.
I agree with that too.
This is nonsense.
We will hope together for progress.
We do not need more directives.
And it is not over yet.
Mr Hughes' report goes far too far.
But we have the Bilbao Agency.
So there is very close cooperation.
Now some specific comments.
It is not just legislation.
Reference was made to quality.
Benchmarking has been referred to.
I spoke about that earlier.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

All workers deserve protection.
That is something we need to address.
Thank you for this sound report.
The topic is labour relations.
That is clearly ridiculous.
The debate is closed.
This explains our second amendment.
We will simply have to wait and see.
It was far more a matter of culture.
Let me first put something straight.
Why is that the case?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Let me start with the latter.
On this I ask for your support.
This is a very important point.
There are other problems with borders.
That is very important.
This is unacceptable.
Why is this so?
And why is that so?
I support what Mr Poettering said.
That would be a recipe for disaster.
It voted 'no'.
Vote 'yes' or disappear.
The EU state comes before the voters.
No, thank you, Mr President.
Let us add solidarity to this list.
President Chirac is mistaken.
Why do they do nothing?
This does not make pleasant reading.
First, Kaliningrad.
I now have a question for Mr Haarder.
This really has now come to nought.
Other countries have also been named.
The EU honours its agreements.
We stand our ground.
Are there such plans in the pipeline?
Your point is worth emphasising.
This is one problem.
All of this is our responsibility.
Time must be found for that later on.
All this also applies to Slovakia.
The people must also be involved.
Cyprus is another issue altogether.
I am indebted to him for this.
My final comment is about Turkey.
No new conditions.
Now we are almost there.
We are approaching our destination.
We are getting there.
Difficulties and problems will arise.
Finally, a word on Turkey.
For that I thank the Irish voters.
That is not asking much.
In that case, we can forget it.
(Applause)
And, in that case, we will not need it.
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner.
(Mixed reactions)
(Laughter and applause)
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:

.

.
.
.
The British Conservatives support this.

This proposal has our full support.
.

.
.
.

.


.
.



.
Examples of this are:
.

Which will take precedence?
I cannot, therefore, support the draft.
We shall not be moved on this.
The EU did not stop at words.
Where do we draw the line?


And I say 'must' advisedly.
We face a different problem today.
We have a real paradox here.
This does not happen under Rule 37.
You said that the authors come first.
Both the authors are sitting here.
Perhaps a mistake has been made!
I sincerely doubt it.
Thank you, Mr President.
This is not enough.
Who could be opposed to this?
I am really waiting for a reply.
They are all equally despicable.
Our grassroots support needs this.
This role is crucial.
Let us not dwell on that, however.
This is true in this report too.
All are very necessary.
What more can one add?
We must stand firm on this.
But this is not the case!
This aspect is not well understood.
That is a fatal message.
Deterrence does not necessarily work.
This is what is required.
We do not need a general opinion.
It requires extra efforts.
Secondly, multilateral action.
The United Nations is the first stage.
Thank you, Commissioner.
My approach will be a different one.
The world changed.
Full security will never be achievable.
Let me turn now to data protection.
Mrs Flesch, your comment will be noted.
The work was also widely praised.
That was clear from what you said.
I urge you to act on them!
We also proposed specific measures.
Allow me to make a preliminary remark.
There were two reactions to this.
Both reactions are wrong!
This is to be welcomed.
It was a great success.
Paragraph 31 concerns standardisation.
That will be a major priority.
Thank you, Commissioner.

Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall hear questions to the Council.
Mr President, this is a point of order.
Mr Galeote Quecedo, you have the floor.

More than that I am unable to say.
The rules of procedure are quite clear.
That code is not binding.
Subject: International Criminal Court
Subject: International Criminal Court
No way.
The EU cannot monitor the whole world.
How would you define it?
Nor do I know if what it says is true.
Subject: The EU and Macedonia
It is a delicate issue, I admit.
Subject: Human rights
That is something quite different.

The first is the definitions.
It is as simple as that.
This is unacceptable!
There is no future in that.
Often it is even very unpleasant.
Passengers will thank us for it.


The debate is closed.
.
There must be a lesson here.
They do not want our fish.
That certainly is a call to action.



The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (Rule 120)
This is the case now.
That will not help any elephant.
That would be very wrong.
This has proved disastrous.
Opinions are divided.
.
The voting slip comprises 4 blocks.
We need this measure without delay.
The joint debate is closed.
The programme has much to offer.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Welcome
Mr Speaker, we welcome you!
(Applause)
The directive aims to do just that.
Congratulations, Mr Mann!
Warm congratulations to both Members!
(Applause)
I would like to congratulate him.
A lot has happened in the meantime.
(Applause)
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Their concerns are also our concerns.
And he has succeeded admirably.
They make money!
There is no academic evidence for this.
We have enormous potential for this.
They are in Russia.
The next item is the vote.
That is just a little warning.
Thank you for those clarifications.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Once again, it has failed to do so.
.



.
.
.
This is indeed extremely gratifying.
.


.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.

Hence our vote against the report.
.
.
.
Lies, I suppose.
.
I want to ask three things.
What, then, will happen after 2012?
What shall we do?
What are the objectives?

We have to clean up our own act.
That is all I have to say.
What about a WTO initiative?
Maybe that is a good idea.
There was one question on air traffic.
Remember that.
I hope you understand my argument.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
We achieved this.
That is correct.
This too has been promised.
So much for the procedure.
Now for a brief material comment.
The Commissioner said as much.
This is the cut-off point.
And another thing.
There will always be GMOs.
That I quite understand.
But the opponents do not want proof.
Perhaps there is a connection.
This debate will certainly continue.
Thank you Commissioner.
It is there, in print.
The debate is closed.
I find that totally unacceptable.
How can they speak about progress!
The latest reports are frightening.
Let us think for a moment.
Not a moment before, however.

Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(The sitting was closed at 5 40 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
This is a disgrace to Europe.
Thank you Commissioner.
We have many requests from the floor.
I would like to make two points.
Thank you, Mr President.
These proposals are a response to that.
We are proposing the opposite.
That is the problem we have to resolve.
This is a very complicated problem.
I have explained what our approach is.
I have spoken with these experts.
I have two questions.
Legal basis: Article 31.
We must, however, keep a cool head.
Yet this is completely untrue.
That is the objective reality.
All the rest is interpretation.
You have mentioned renewable energy.
Third question: Le Monde.
(Applause)
We made a number of crucial decisions.
The EU's policy is clear.
We also sent a clear signal to Turkey.
(Applause)
We made three crucial decisions.
The answer is: hard work.
We are already in full swing.
(Applause)
There is no time to waste.
I am thinking of the Balkans.
Thank you.
This is an absurd situation.
(Applause)
(Interruptions)
I wish you much success in this.
(Applause)
Finally, it has been won.
Listen to what we are saying.
I believe it is fair to point this out.
We cannot.
What are elections for?
What are Parliaments for?
Why?
There are now ten.
Will he be out of a job?
Will he abandon the proposal?
Are we going to continue working?
We are talking about our future.
(Applause)
Secondly, the safety clauses.
My party warmly welcomes this.
Particularly in terms of agriculture.
I stress the words 'in the long run'.
Finally, a word on Chechnya.
That was defeated at the summit.
I think that this is a good sign.
This is wonderful!
I have three further points to make.
No doubt there are reasons for this.
What a credible policy!
That cannot be for real!
I know that.
Yes, you in particular!
(Applause)
(Laughter, interruptions)
(Applause)
No, they do not.
Thank you, Mr President.
Turkey is a candidate country.
I do not want to spend time on this.
It is that simple.
That is clear.
Could you confirm this for me?
I will comment on the objective.




(Applause)

(Applause)
That was more than twenty years ago!
We need to kick-start this issue.
That is right and it is true.
Both these things are true.
The risk should also be calculable.
Terrorists follow no political agenda.
Mr President, the world must avoid war.
Not so much with words as with deeds.
The air attacks are unrelenting.
The war has already begun.
Unemployment is increasing.

What is it that we want?
Or pessimistic.
We have already done that.
Their efforts must continue.
What did we want to see?
Three things.
These three things have been achieved.
Thank you very much, Mr Solana.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the joint debate
Mr Daul has the floor.
The debate was extremely comprehensive.
I am counting on your support in this!
I wish my views to be recorded.
Of course.
Nothing has been fixed here.
A few words now on the mid-term review.
That is completely impossible.
Is that right?
The first is price protection.
The third principle is stability.
I can do no more about it than you.
There are four reasons for this:
Thank you, Mr President.
Before 2008 or not?
We welcome and support its objectives.
Finally, as a member of the GUE/NGL ...
(The president cut the speaker off)
(The President cut off the speaker)
I congratulate Mr Daul heartily.
That is all very well and good.
In conclusion, I would like to ?
(The President cut the speaker off)
How will the policy eventually look?
How long will the reforms take?
And why?
The floor is yours, Commissioner.
This is the approach we should adopt.
What lies behind this declaration?
This was not the case.
Pursuant to Rule 37(2)
The debate is closed.
They are old friends.
That is therefore what will happen.
The joint debate is closed.
.
More of the same is no longer enough.
Joost has already listed the deficits.
I am referring to the Dayton Agreement.
They have many problems in common.
It is also its most severe test.
The debate is closed.
And rural areas?
What is the backdrop to the debate?
So what do we conclude from all this?
My region is an Objective 2 region.
That is another issue to be studied.
We in this House want to help you.
The debate is closed.
Completing the internal market
What is in it for them?
How does the market work for them?
I will come back to them shortly.
Thank you, Lord Stockton.
I hope that this clarifies the issue.
Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou.
Thank you, Mr Perry.
Thank you for your observation.
His case is very simple.
I would like to make two points.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Thank you Mr Ford.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
The remainder is deleted.
This threat is unacceptable.
.
We must congratulate ourselves on this.
First of all, greater transparency.
Secondly, a matter of rigidity.
This is too rigid.
.
.
In fact, the problems remain.
.
.
.
Who will end up paying for this?
.
.
.
.
.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Monday:
But I take note of your request.
Tomorrow is absolutely impossible.
Wednesday:
(Parliament agreed to the request)
Thursday:
(Parliament agreed to the request)
(Parliament rejected the request)
No change.
I count on your cooperation.

That would be my personal preference.
Nothing has happened to date.
Are we Europeans so powerful, then?
This is a scandalous state of affairs.
I take note of what you have said.
Mr President, on a point of order.
We all feel powerless.
That concludes the item.
The reality was much more prosaic.
Why has no progress been made?
Is it because it is very complicated?
It is more than that.
It is for us to restore this balance.
We must not let it become one.


Take Italy, for example.
We must reflect on all this.
The name to mention here is Berlusconi.
How is it going to be defined?
Those issues are already there.
Do not ignore them.
I agree with what Mrs Hieronymi said.
That is the question.
I say yes, we do.
That is not the case!



A final thought for now.
Yes, of course it is.
They do so for other reasons.
This is why people take up smoking.
It is all a pretence.
We will see what happens tomorrow.
In short, the law has rights too.
Is this wise?
May I add a few examples?
This is a real test of that.
All the others, the Commission rejects.
We have done that.
This is also my answer to Mr Harbour.
But do not just take my word for it.
Of course, it is.
Let us not leave it there.
The debate is closed.
The debate is closed.
C5-0331/2002 - 2002/2175(COS)].
Allow me to outline some of them.
Truly impressive.
This cannot be completely justified.
In any event, they are still necessary.
Reform is not the solution.
The CFP cannot be reformed.
Today, this is all but impossible.
This is a fact!
What shall we do, therefore?
That I will not do.
Am I a puppet; are we marionettes?
Granted, we all want to be re-elected.
We must keep our heads.
Why should this be so?
It does not make sense.
We have a common agricultural policy.
It makes no sense.
That should also apply to fish.
It would make a lot more sense.
Fish do not swim separately in the sea.
In the North Sea cod is disappearing.
It is not a coincidence.
We must do something about it.
Again, is this a coincidence?
I would agree here with Mr McCartin.
It beggars belief.
That is what we have put forward.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
It is based on a dual principle.
This needs to be ratified.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.09 p.m.)
(Applause)
It was, of course, an informal meeting.
Radical reforms have been carried out.
They are requirements that must be met.
The Commission takes the same view.
The same applies to the Commission.
(Applause)
This comes as no surprise.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Finally, we are not accountants.

(Applause)
We are asking a great deal.
There are still major areas of poverty.
That has to be clarified.
The second issue has to do with Turkey.
What does this mean in practical terms?
The pace of reform is the main issue.
Another point is Turkey's candidature.
The same applies to the European Union.
My thesis is threefold.
Thank God that was not the case.
It has never once been unified.
And it does not always get it.
It is absurd from every angle.
It is beyond me.
Finally, to Cyprus.
We must support these negotiations.
We must hope they turn out well.
Thank you Mr Co√ªteaux.
It is a real danger.
This is a considerable step forward.
This must be welcomed.
Thank you.
Your comments have been noted.
I have two questions.
For ever!
These people are being badly informed.
What is required is simply unfeasible.
Europe is at a crossroads.
Together we will succeed.
What is the Commission's view on this?
This is a question for the Council.
I condemn this move.
This is an historic day in Parliament.
I myself come from the Baltic region.
How welcome are we?
That is not acceptable nor is it wise.
Two chapters remain to be closed.
Is that not pure opportunism?
Is it not beyond belief?
It is intolerably dishonest.
The road is still not an easy one.
We are making this offer even now.
That is the main problem.
I will be perfectly honest with you.
That is now history.
I will try to be brief.
We all hope that it will be a success.
Ten new countries are about to join.
May everything go according to plan!
Such friends are valuable at this time.
The timetable for 2004 is a tight one.
This is far from being the case.
That is the way things are.
Major progress has been made, however.
Otherwise, we shall have problems.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.20 p.m.)
We prefer a framework directive.
This is reflected in the annexes.
That is simply not the way to proceed.
I will believe that when I see it!
If it is there, it is well hidden.
I fully agree with her.
I have no objection to this.
We are extremely concerned about this.
Have we any news on this?
I think this sounds excellent.
I am referring to Europol and others.
I find this extraordinary.
I do not find this acceptable.
Mr President, I have two questions.
My second question is about migration.
The Zagreb Summit is coming up.
Yes or no?
That really is not acceptable.
That has to be the right way forward.
The same goes for the Court.
That is an incitement to separatism.
Then there is our role in the world.
We must continue along this road.
This is an ongoing battle.
We are on track.
Silence please!
But this is all just a recommendation.
Thank you very much, Mr Haarder.
Mr Haarder is nodding in agreement.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the vote.
Before the vote:
Before the vote on paragraph 3:
I take note of your comments.
However, the date ought to be changed.
Before the vote on paragraph 9:
Before the vote on Amendment No 51:
I hope that the mover can accept this.
Before the vote on Amendment No 42:
These amendments are compatible.
That is why we vote.
Before the vote on Amendment No 10:
Before the vote on paragraph 71:
Before the vote on paragraph 102:
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
(Loud applause and heckling)
Thank you for that vital explanation.
(Laughter and loud applause)
This is a second reading.
Before the vote on Amendment No 32:
Joint motion for a resolution
.
That lies upon their conscience.
I therefore voted for it.
.
Generosity will vary.
.

.
1.
2.
.
.
.
We voted against this report.
.
How could it be otherwise?
.
.
.
This is the focus of the report.
.
.
.
.
.
.
dissuasive and uniform sanctions.
.
Make of that what you will.
.

.
We must stop this hypocrisy.
Smoking kills.
This must stop!
.
I find this intolerable.
.
.
There is a good reason for this.
Take the example of drugs money.
.
.
.
.
.
.
The outcome of the vote was as follows.
2.
3.
Very well, Mr Wynn.
This was a key point for both parties.
This is also valid for Chechnya.
On the contrary, we need to stand firm.
Now let me turn to Kaliningrad.
This must not be allowed to happen.
To their credit, they do not.
The first one is about Kaliningrad.
Secondly, Chechnya.
I believe this to be an aberration.
That would have been entirely possible.
Rightly so.
In fact nothing else needs to happen.
This is a very important commitment.
Is Crown Resources a Russian company?
We need something stronger.
It is time for the stick.
They were deported by Stalin.
So how have we reacted?
What is the situation in Chechnya?
Let us not mince our words.
It has certainly been a lively debate.
Mr Nielson has confirmed this today.
Everything has been done by the book.
Of course not.
So nothing was forgotten.
Stick at it.
I would therefore advocate caution.
This is a very worrying situation.
Madam President, this is a long story.
This is an intolerable situation!
I was there two years ago.
Negotiations are not yet complete.
This finally took place on 16 November.
How can you regard this as cooperation?
Did you actually read our report?
Who influenced you?
Who pressurised you?
This was an historic moment.

They have just elected a Speaker.

That was bound to lead to tensions.
The general took over in a coup.
That is important.
We must avoid over-simplification.
I believe that is our common hope.
Finally, I have one further question.
I just cannot understand that.
That is the problem we face.
These were a couple of issues.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the joint debate on:
It is not an interinstitutional group.
That is clear.
In my view the report is very focused.
Indeed it is a monopoly of initiative.
I welcome this announcement.
I do not find this sensible.
Temporary means temporary.
In general terms, we endorse it.
That is legal mumbo jumbo.
That is very important.
I wager it would not.
That is only to be expected.
I consider them entirely legitimate.
Again I agree with her.
Mrs Villiers is very much against.
It does not commit you to anything.
I agree.
Let me repeat what I said earlier.
I agree with her.
That discussion was very fruitful.
I am certainly cautious in all I do.
We must be consistent here.
This cannot be justified to consumers.
I ardently support the ban.

The debate is closed.
Secondly, the minimum period of use.
Finally, the new Scientific Committee.
Their use goes back over millennia.
What is in it?
What will it do for me?
What do they fear?
Let us welcome it.
My group will therefore support it.
This lottery has to end.
There is no justification for it.
However, there will be exceptions.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.

It has taken nearly a year.
This is a codecision dossier.
One is 'day one comparability'.
The second is the comparator.



They cannot be working in a vacuum.
That is a fact.
This we must prevent.
This we cannot accept.
This is no way to negotiate.
This is intolerable!
More jobs can provide both.
That is absolutely right.
That is wishful thinking.
That is not so.
There is not adequate protection.
There is none.
That was the reason, Mr Crowley.
It is also a transboundary issue.
That is actually what it is all about.
All workers have a probationary period.
There you are, Mr Andersson.
We are not at extremes in this area.
It is a balance which should be struck.
We want to find that balance.
Do we not want supply to meet demand?
Mr Crowley has a comment on procedure.
That is a good suggestion!
There are two types of amendment.
The remaining amendments are rejected.
The debate is closed.
rapporteur.
This represents a genuine sea change.
There are many reasons for this.
What does this mean in practice?
This is not what is said here.
That is what it says here.
The consumers do not want them.
Where is the market, in reality?
Let me come to my real point.
The Commission calls for this as well.
The debate is closed.
.
EIB Annual Report (2001)
Thank you very much.
Why should the EIB have special status?

You mentioned various alternatives.
This is not always the case however.
Clearly, this is nothing new.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
(Applause)
Transparency is not guaranteed.
(Loud applause)
Thank you for your comment, Ms Thors.
Mr Pronk, do you have any objections?
The debate has already taken place.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That will be the first line.
It is the Greens.
.
.
.
.
Probably the latter, it would appear.
.
'Why ever not?', I asked her.
Integration cannot be legislated.
They pay very dearly for their status.
The social reality is intractable.
No they are not!
.
.
We cannot acknowledge these results.
.
We therefore abstained.
'We are already doing that,' I replied.
.
.
.
.
.
Why are we not facing the battle?
That is not an insignificant number.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
This is obviously a crucial question.
We certainly missed her in New Delhi.
We had in mind Russia in particular.
It was a fascinating exercise.
The debate is closed.
.
The first lesson is crystal clear.
They must be put into practice now.
We need to go further.
Clearly, the answer is no.
They must come into force.
The sea is Galicia's life.
We now call on them to respond in kind.
Information has failed too.
Nonetheless, further action is needed.
The victims' interests must come first.
This was clearly not the case here.
I have a question concerning airports.
We therefore need to improve our rules.





We voted on two blocks of measures.
Many of them are good.
Inadequate for two reasons.


So what do we need to do next?
We obviously need a set of measures.
We need to help these people.
The indignation is growing by the hour.
So where is the problem?
You know the result!
That is enough!
In 2001, two.
That is what I am saying.
And I have asked for information.
That is what I am talking about.
How many more?
Well, that is my point.
The second issue.
We are talking about going further.
(Applause)

Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.
The debate is closed.
Several thousand people were arrested.
Many are being tortured.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
It is schizophrenic.
Iran is a complex society.
(Sustained applause)
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
That is all, Mr President.
Before the vote on Amendment No 1:
Congratulations are always welcome!
.
.
(The sitting was closed at 5.55 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
You can write to the President.
The reform is progressing positively.
That too is untrue.
I will end with two questions.
(Applause)
You will be aware that I am that MEP.
I find the report very enlightening.
We fear the worst.
But what did you write?
We would really like that answer.
Was it some secretary?
What is going on within your systems?
We want reform.
Thank you very much.
Why do we not give the error rate?
If only!
That is the reason.
What for?
Mr Dell'Alba said that he is worried.
I believe we should all be worried.
Because this is not simply a face-lift.
He failed to give me an answer to this.
That is all.
Let me start with the latter.
I personally sympathise with this view.
We cannot in decency do otherwise.
This dialogue is very important.
What is on the agenda at Copenhagen?
Basically three points.
We, however, do not share their view.
Lastly, a word about Turkey.
Above all it has given them hope.
Do you think I do not know that?
That must stand centre-stage.
And now for Turkey.
The law matters to us.
I still maintain that criticism.
I should not now enter the debate.
First, the praise.
I hope for a 'yes' vote.
What are the deadlines?
How are they to be met?
That is the most important thing.
How about that?
Today, things have changed.
A great deal!
This story is paradoxical.
We should be clear on that.
At some point we must say no.
Berlin and Brussels cannot be breached.
What did you actually do?'
Are we really going to say that?
Because it is going to sound very lame.
Let us not lose sight of that.
Why is this?
That is sending the wrong signal.
What brings us together?
Where must our borders end?
They are meant to be fully involved.
Is this the EU as a peace project?
Is this reasonable?
Is this the EU as a peace project?
But how can this be done?
That is a sine qua non.
So what is the problem?
I fully agree with Mr Titley.
It must succeed.
Concerning Turkey, the basis is clear.
Turkey is a candidate.
That is precisely the problem.
We are not like that at all.
That is why the decision was necessary.
That is the full background.
That concludes the debate.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
and
We are all equal here.
It is high time.
Let me remind you.
What happened?
The ball lies in Parliament's court.
We have made progress.
That was a long time ago.
There is a time for everything.
Omnia tempus habent.
Obviously we find this unacceptable.
Let us be honest therefore.
It consists of three parts.
We are special.
What do we have on the table today?
Confused?
I certainly am.
So, what are we discussing here?
But, help is at hand!
That is one problem.
The answer is yes.
I said that quite clearly.
That is an answer for Mr Lehne.
The ball is in Parliament's court.
That concludes the joint debate.
'Nunca mais' - never again.
Thank you very much.
and
I can only quote them.
Now to the Structural Funds.
I do not think so.
There are two main elements to this.

Our heart is with them at this time.
I want to speak about the cod crisis.

What are we really doing there?
What are our plans for sustainability?

Help us, help the Galicians.
Europe owes Galicia a debt.
Let us now talk about fisheries reform.
Let us stop being hypocritical.
We must analyse the matter.
Thank you all very much.
Now it is your turn, Mr Fischler.
That is all I have to say.
We need to go further.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Fishermen share common interests.
This plunder must stop.
These waters must be protected.
I will be supporting his reports.
It therefore has a crucial role.
I have one last comment to make.
For whose benefit?
That reminds me of a joke.
Oh well, be that as it may ?
Harsh words, but I stand by them.
That is just plain stupid.
Sad, but true!
As you see, this is an age-old problem.
This principle is not being applied.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Parliament is on your side.
Fine.
Why was quota control not in place?
Let us mainly focus on these issues.
I have said that this is too little.
Why is the situation in Iceland better?
Now to the reports.
Now to access to waters and stocks.
And so to fleet policy.
I also accept Amendment No 78.
And that includes quota reductions.
Now to the final proposal on scrapping.
Now to the proposed amendments.
The debate is closed.
No it does not!
There is a better way.
The debate is closed.
So what next?
Europe is sorely in need of one.
What do I mean by that?
This must be our starting point.
We should use the current mechanisms.
We really must be allowed enough time.
Clear progress indeed.
This is a much discussed subject.
The directive is to be welcomed.
I grant you that.
I agree with that.
I thought that sense had triumphed!
That is why I will be voting in favour.
The debate is closed.
The data is required every three years.
Transgenic animals must be included.
I can support Amendment No 3.
I have tabled three amendments.
I am delighted with this report.
No, you ask yourself, can they suffer?
And that they certainly can.
I want to say two things.
Why are we doing this?
Is it being duplicated?
What will the results be?
The debate is closed.
Short-term residence permits
.
They turn it into an empty shell.
That must be our goal.
Directives do not help, therefore.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
.
There are other concerns too.
I would like to outline these briefly.
I am pleased to see this development.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We believe it is a good proposal.
(Applause)
The same applies to European democracy.
What is at stake here?
This is, furthermore, our duty.
Yes, but to whom?
That, however, is a biased approach.
Let us talk of a Constitution.
Therefore, the debate is an open one.
And there is much more besides.
How is that to happen?
By a majority or unanimously?
What do you have in mind?
That is what I would suggest.
So how will that work out in practice?
Will you resign every time?
It is simply a recipe for confusion!
There is already a federal currency.
The question of accountability remains.
That is all it says!
Convention, seize your opportunity!
We feel it is worthwhile and relevant.
I have a question to ask, however.
We think this Congress a bad idea.
And what does the Commission say?
This is of course quite impossible.
That is the principal message.
A few very brief comments.
(Applause)
Thank you, President Prodi.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
After the vote:
Could that please be corrected?
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament approved the joint text)
(Parliament approved the joint text)
.
I would be truly grateful.
Before the vote on Amendment No 20:
This article should be voted on.
This is what we did.
Rapporteur, I owe you an apology.
I apologise.
Okay, I resign!
(Laughter)
Nothing more.
.
(Applause)
Everyone knows that as soon as ?
Listen, and speak afterwards.
(Applause)
The requests before us are clear.
I see no point in extending the debate.
Joint motion for a resolution
I asked to speak because Mr Watson did.
(Loud, prolonged applause, heckling)
I do not need to add anything else!
Thank you.
I want to make one brief comment.
We have adopted a resolution today.
Joint motion for a resolution
.
.
Hence our abstention from the vote.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
The opposite is happening, however.
.
This is why I reject this compromise.
.
That was the reason for abstention.

.
He has largely succeeded in this.
.
.

.
.
.
.
These are:
.
.


We therefore voted against the report.
I voted against the report.
.
.
Among other aspects:
I voted against this programme.
.
What about the other Member States?
.
.
(Applause)
I rebel.
(Applause)
Something, however, must be done.
That is dangerous.
What do we tell them?
We believe in democracy.
Something is happening in the region.
If I am, however, I make no apologies.
We must be careful.
I am in favour of this.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Do not give us milk.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Yes, I agree.
Open up your markets.
(Applause)
I like equality.
They do not want to be offered crumbs.
(Applause)

(Applause)
I would like to thank the President.
Far from it, it was a call to action.
I declare the formal sitting closed.
Resumption of the session
Tuesday
Wednesday
They will be here until 7 p.m.
I will inform you of those.

Just read the record.
This is such an exceptional case.
I will be happy to do it a second time.
I will come back to you on this matter.
I would like to thank you for this.
This is a serious responsibility.

I plan to be with my family.
No one understands anything.
Make of that what you can.
These, therefore, are the main points.

It is a difficult subject.
I commend it to the House.


Quite the opposite in fact.
The rest is mere detail.
I believe this is the wrong way around.
I should like to say one thing.
You urge us to do this.
You tell us you are aiming to simplify.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I see that Mr Krarup is here.
That was an aside.
The debate is closed.
We are quite pleased with that as well.


Why do we do that?
The proof has not yet been provided.
This requires further investigation.
Irradiation is not necessary.
There are many alternatives.
It is not as negative as he suggests.
That is the committee's broad view.
Well, it is safe.
The WHO says so.
It can protect food from contamination.
The Commission is in listening mode.
And what has happened?
The detection methods are in place.
Why, then, do they not want it?
Thank you very much, Mr Schnellhardt.
The debate is closed.
That is remarkable.



It means that class war is being waged.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.20 p.m.)
Other sources mention up to 10 million.
We advocate three months.
Against that, we must be armed.
This must never happen again.
I think not.
What do we do now?
We have evidence in plenty.
The report admits that.
It was all very vague.
Parliaments must be involved.
Unfortunately they were successful.
That is a good idea.
Where should it begin?
You never know what is going to happen.
I prefer to look ahead.

I am sorry it was such a struggle.
His report is first-rate.
Others have touched upon the details.
I do not want to do that.
We should stress this again and again.


They have worked very hard on this.
(The President cut off the speaker)
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
and
(Parliament adopted the resolution)

(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
.
I also want to tell you why.
You simply have to bear that in mind.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
The military was above the law.
Were they the only war criminals?
.
.
.
.
We must put an end to this situation.
We think otherwise, however.
.
.
.

Hence our vote against the report.
The answer is clearly 'No'.
.


.
.

.


.
.

Not so.
My constituents expect no less.
Lapses in bio-security.
.
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Rapporteurs:
Mr Stenmarck, for the other sections.
These are things that have worked well.
That is an entirely unreasonable model.
In my judgment, this is possible.
Honesty demands that we say that.
Even so, we have already tackled them.
My group supports this.
Perhaps the Commissioner knows.
And that is good news.
Not to mention Heading 3.
All well and good.
Other examples abound.
After all, the citizen foots the bill.
They were stuck and could not get out.
They replied: 'Yes, we are!'
The reply came: 'We have no money'.
(Applause)
That has not been complied with.
The answer remains in the air.
The reality of enlargement is upon us.
How can these be reduced?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Last week we had Copenhagen.
This is absolutely vital.
Copenhagen is a historic milestone.
How will things go next year?
The first is external trade.


The debate is closed.
There are two objective factors here.
I agree with that.
Have those barriers come down yet?
If not, when will they come down?
So this is national policy.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I have two questions.
This therefore is our approach.
But what do you preside over now?
I have a very precise question.
That is not correct.
I turn now to Mrs Theato's question.
What will happen in the meantime?
Thank you very much, Mrs Schreyer.
Please cooperate.

The final point of order.
I asked who that person was.
Part I
This is quite clear.
We are clearly worried.
Subject: EU-wide nuclear regulation

This was appalling of you.
Subject: Air transport and noise
Subject: New Berlaymont building
I apologise for his absence.
But an impression has been created.
We recognise your personal courage.
You do not walk alone.
You do not work in isolation.'
In that way we will build a true peace.
We do not have a single weapon.
They are not exclusive.
That is the main cause of our poverty.
Thank you and happy Christmas.
(Standing ovation)

Definitely not.
Blood and blood products are not goods.
The debate is closed.
Commissioner, you have the floor.
Nitrofurans is a generic term.
I admit I am not a scientist.
I therefore have a few questions.
What are we to say to the fatteners?
What are they to do?
So we do not need to go there.
Is it sent back?
What is done with it?
Why are these missions being postponed?
How is that possible?
Why were four weeks allowed to elapse?
My second question is this.
That is a Commission decision.
I will read you what it says:
That simply does not happen.
This is not an inconsiderable issue.
All the time we keep this under review.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

My reply to Mr Bowe is therefore 'yes'.
The debate is closed.
What is the point of it?'
That is the reason for this directive.
We have set binding targets.
I think that can be called a success.
I believe this was also a good step.
We went from 6 to 4 kilograms.
We are doing that to tight deadlines.
We simply export a host of problems.
It is a splendid piece of legislation.
This is an historic breakthrough.
Is this really what Monnet planned?
Surely there is a better way.
Thank you very much, Mr R√ºbig.
The debate is closed.
Finally, I would like to cite a case.
Thank you very much, Mrs Hautala.
The debate is closed.
Danish presidency
This can be seen from our achievements.
This is the way it has to be.
A new Europe is born.
Thank you, Mr President.
We have delivered.
Most of these fears are groundless.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
No national parliament can do that.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Let me make a comment on Turkey.
(Applause)
(Applause)
The question is transition.
Will this change or not?
I am sure you will do this.
However, we must not be complacent.
You did fantastically well!'
Is that one of the Copenhagen criteria?
This is where we need a road map.
I approve of what the Council has said.
For this, you must be complimented.
There is Moldavia too and Israel.
They are well deserved.
It was an outstanding achievement.
That is what they said, loud and clear.
Congratulations.
We have a lot to celebrate today.
There is still a lot to be done.
The EU is no Christian club.
The will was there.
Your efforts will go down in history.
The EU is to be reformed.
The EU must become more democratic.
Referendums must be held.
This is the other side of the coin.
That cannot be right.
What will we do as regards Chechnya?
(Applause)
Is this in fact possible?
Is this what we are called to?
You will have to convince the public.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I hope we learn the lesson of Nice.
That is a message for all of us here.
I think that this is a very good thing.
The other is to do with agriculture.
This is a great opportunity for Turkey.
I object to this.
I shall tackle two specific points.
Surely not!
I want to quote an example.
We have to have talks about this.
These Europes did not exist back then.
Turkey is a great deal more difficult.
The system is too deep-rooted for that.
We can be proud of this result.
I think that this is very important.
Those are his ideas.
The debate is closed.
.
.
.
.

.
In short, the joint text lays down:
.

That concludes voting time.
Are there any comments?
I share your concern, Mr Bautista.
(The Minutes were adopted)
Today I must reiterate this.


(Applause)



(Applause)
The time for talking is over.
We must draw up a rule for this.
We must have this.

What is done is done.

Galicians are admirable.
So what exactly am I getting at?
Port controls are vitally important.
Yes.
Should we reprimand ministers?
Yes.
But we need to do more.
We Galicians are strong.
Why not?


This must never happen again.
Never again!
What do the conclusions say?
These statements are very revealing.
Where are the concrete measures?
What is happening with port controls?
How much longer are we going to wait?
How many more disasters must happen?
The environment must be preserved.
Things just never change.
This is the way Europe works.
I find this particularly regrettable.
Firstly for prevention.
This is of course unacceptable.
Must we investigate all these aspects?
Yes.
Should we prevent them?
Again yes.
Secondly, cure.
An inquiry?
Of course.
Let me give you two examples.

What grounds have we heard here?
They do not exist.
That is what we are working on.
.
There are two types of liability.
That is what we are talking about.
And what does this mean?

(Applause)

And that is what we have to deal with.
We must provide a solution.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I really do not understand Mr Galeote.
Mr President, a saying is a saying.
This has been said here, literally.
That is what I meant.
Let us consider this issue closed.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the joint debate on
Certainly more could have been done.
What should we do?

None of them have been adopted.
And we know who they are.
This is not Mr Haarder's fault.
Allow me to stress two points.
These issues are real issues.
I will refer firstly to immigration.
Unfortunately, they are.
Lastly, a fundamental question.
It is essential.
In any case, it is unacceptable.
But that is not what they are about.
I very much regret this.
.
He was the chairman and I was a member.
So thank you for your concern.
Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino.
I would ask you to be brief.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
That is our limit.
Subject: Expulsions in Northern Cyprus

Subject: Common patent system
This must happen, however.
We must get this matter finalised.
Subject: European Constitution
Is that the Council's view?
The Council has no view.
I shall spare him that.
Subject: Cyprus
The principle is real exposure.
Subject: Weapons used in Afghanistan
Rather, it is the starting pistol.
Why can we not talk of sport as sport?
I can let you into another secret.
It has submitted four documents.
Why?
We must be ambitious for social Europe.
And what is the Council doing?
However, that is part of the job!
This is extremely disappointing.
Yes or no?
What do you mean by 'open'?
Both interpretations make me uneasy.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
(Applause)
Now I turn to the formalities.
We have done it in record time.
I am quite happy to follow your advice.
(Mixed reactions)
(Applause)
Joint motion for a resolution
I wanted to vote against!
President.
That concludes the vote.
I wish you all a very happy Christmas.
Happy Christmas!
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.

.
.
.
.
.

That is why I am voting against this.
We do not.
It also represents an opportunity.
.
.

Close at it was, c'est la vie, Madame!
I hope that will be picked up again.
There is also some delay on that.
What is the reason for this delay?
Can the Commission tell us?
Why is this decision so long in coming?
One does not choose to be born a woman.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENTS (RULE 120)
Europe has a duty to set an example.
That would have been very welcome.
This is a conflict.
That is disgraceful.
What, then, can we suggest?

The debate is closed.
That policy must be respected.
No!
I shall give a couple of quotes.
I put it to you that there is concern.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.

Our job is to intervene.
An end to settlements!
They get us nowhere.
And an end to terrorist action!
No other policy makes sense.
It is no good being in the audience.
It is killing them.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
It is, at any rate, a step on the way.
That is not how matters should proceed.
.
International standards were breached.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Prior to the vote on Tibet:
.
That is a good point.
We shall make sure that happens.
We have noted the fact.
The vote is concluded.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
But that is not even true.
(The sitting was closed at 5.25 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
We expect him sometime soon.
Monday
Thursday
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you Mr Gollnisch.
We are dealing with the agenda.
Brussels part-session, January 2003
Wednesday:
That is something we must not do.
I certainly intend to be there myself.
They are all under 25 years of age.
None have criminal records.
This is a matter of great urgency.

That concludes the item.
On all these issues there is consensus.
That surely is important.
'What's a Luxembourger?' says my mate.
It is a price not worth paying.
This is very regrettable.
But who is the 'Sire' in this instance?
It is a Union of States and peoples.
Europe is a contract, not a constraint.
It has been changed back to tomorrow?
There are two problems causing this.
We hear that ad nauseam.

(Applause from the right)
The question deserves to be asked.
It is about something much larger.
Opinion forming is important.
Let us not forget that.
These are by way of clarification.


This is not an easy situation.
You speak of rights and freedoms.
Is it ambitious?
This weakens the basis of democracy.
Mrs Swiebel has made this clear.
We are not perfect.
They are two sides of the same coin.
Certainly if I read paragraph 133.
Is this a crime against human rights?
Mrs Swiebel has been very selective.


The debate is closed.
We can get down to work.


Firstly, in the legislative field.




How?
No answer.
What does the report have to say?
Not a word.
No thank you.
I agree with Mr Krarup on that.

I have high hopes of them.
Good night.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 9 p.m.)
Community railways







Why have we tabled amendments?
And we need a high level of safety.
I hope that the Commission agrees.
Firstly, a structure.
Who is responsible for what?
Everyone must know how things stand.
It is an important point, however.
In my opinion, this is the Swiss way.
I will finish on that note.
They have done some excellent work.
Mr Savary has also done good work.
It has not even been fully implemented.
Back to square one.
There is nothing wrong with that.
Foresight is the essence of government.

That is what we have to realise.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
This was a challenge for us.
We wanted to build in flexibility.
Thank you for your attention.
Road safety is an important matter.
They should be ashamed of themselves.
What then is to be done?
That is only the driving time.
Two starting points are crucial here.
What is the reasoning behind this?
That is not my competence.
Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
My group opposes the oral amendments.
Before the vote on Amendment No 91:
Your point does not therefore hold.
- -
Before the vote on Amendment No 18:
It is an issue of crucial importance.
.
This is why I voted against it.
.
.
.
.
.
I therefore voted for the motion.
That is why I abstained.
Why Cyprus and not Scotland?
.
The Member States are not homogenous.
.
.

I accordingly voted against the report.
I have voted in favour of this report.
Are there any comments?
And we need to act in two directions.
The future of Europe.
We hope not. We want peace.
(Applause)
First, the status of MEPs.
(Applause)
This was clear throughout your speech.

We will make a good team.
A startling figure.
Clearly, we must invest in the future.


Let me move on to the Lisbon process.
(Applause)
Firstly, enlargement.
Firstly, a reunified Cyprus.
Secondly, the Lisbon Strategy.
I wish you lots of luck.
There must be no war with Iraq.
Be bold enough to do it!
Let us begin with the Iraqi crisis.
No proof at all.
We said 'yes'.
We must tell the Security Council this.
These indicators must be equal.
You spoke of maritime safety - fine!
That is scandalous!
Lastly, you spoke of Cyprus.
Naturally, you want a united Cyprus.
Thank you Mr President.
I have seen them with my own eyes.


But they do expect the right approach.
Sittings come and go. So do programmes.
An excellent move.

I wish you every success.
May I wish you every success.
He managed to avert that war.
Obviously our group agrees with this.
This has been a most useful debate.
I believe that this is the way to go.
You all know that I never exaggerate.
I can assure you: we are lost.
I can give you another figure.
We are deluding ourselves.
That concludes the item.
Part I
President.
I would be happy to do so.
That is not possible.
Subject: Humanitarian crisis in Angola
De-mining is also important.
This is extremely high on the agenda.
Subject: Recent maritime disasters
Copenhagen speaks of specific measures.



Part II
Questions to Commissioner de Palacio

Questions to Commissioner Liikanen
It is a very, very serious matter.
Subject: Greece and SMEs
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.


Questions to Commissioner Patten
I have two points.
Subject: Status of Kosovo
That is an 'either/or' approach.
I just wanted to point that out.
I should like to make two points.
All of us condemn suicide bombing.
Subject: Voice of Europe
In its answer to Question H-0234/02

We cannot seriously accept this.
You spoke of trust and security.
Proper safeguards will be needed.
Yes, we have excessive costs.
We all want a level playing field.
Thank you very much, Mr Karas.
The debate is closed.

Let us just be honest.
These facts are not unrelated.
GATS threatens this.
In Europe we all have the same problem.
Why?
Why?
I have never believed that.
Let me make another comment.
I am very pleased about that.
Some, quite wrongly, deny this.
The report emphasises prevention.
Thank you very much, Mr Karas.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.07 p.m.)

It is far from that.

What is the situation today?
Tremendous steps have been taken.
It is not so today.
When will this duplicity end?
Is this rhetoric or sentimentality?
No.
Regrettably this is still happening.
This must come to an end.
This must not be allowed to continue.
This must not be allowed to happen.
I remember Bonn just over a year ago.
It is all very vague.
But it is something we must press for.
Women's rights are revealing.
This must stop.
What is this about, first and foremost?
Have women been forgotten again?
What has become of their rights?
What legal system do they come under?
None at all.
Are there any solutions?
Yes.
This is only one of many examples.
They can be won over - but by anyone.
Much still needs to be done.
Let us take a look into the future.
Well done!
All this is true.
They do have a difficult job.
We have to go on repeating that.
We strongly support this initiative.
So we are aware of these concerns.
All of them gave rise to controversy.
We did.
It sticks.
It is one in which I am happy to join.
The third point concerns allergens.
Some cosmetics still contain allergens.
So we have also won on that point.
It has been a long gestation period.
Congratulations are in order for that.
I am wholly in favour of it.
Such a grandmother would be done for!
Thank you, rapporteur.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
The sitting is suspended until 12 noon.
The next item is the vote.
Joint motion for a resolution
Before the vote on Amendment No 23:
Could my colleagues help me here?
I think we have lost the page.
We have lost a whole page.
It is OK.
We will catch up.
(Laughter and applause)
(Laughter and applause)
Before the vote on Amendment No 24:
I have checked in the other versions.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I agree with you entirely.
That concludes the vote
.
.
.
Why did I vote for the report?
.
.
Item 23:
Item 67:
Item 133:
.
We therefore voted against.
.
No country is spared!
.
.
.
.
Hence our vote in favour of the report.
.
For example:
1.
However, the three facts are omitted:
2.
Conscientious objectors:
.
.
.
I have voted against the report.
It is the first step.
.
.
But why?
Against whom and against what?
.
combat illegal immigration.
.
.
We can move freely.
Security is no longer guaranteed.
I therefore reject this proposal.
.
.
.
.
.
The questions are financial.
The questions are also professional.
.
.
Members voting - 535;
Blank or spoiled ballots - 26;
Votes cast - 509
Absolute majority - 255.
One point I would like to make is this.
Thank you for your comments, Mr Perry.
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mrs Thors.
Your comments have been noted.
This is a mistake.
(The Minutes were approved)
In my eyes, that is not enough.
Secondly we must ask: which policies?
There are also a dozen in Israel.
The debt is USD 30 billion.
There is glaring inequality.

How does the Council view that?
That is the paradox we face today.
Is there a need for an association?
Unfortunately that is still in doubt.
It has already made a number of moves.
Thank you for your comment, Mr Brok.
It has yet to see the light of day.
I hope I am wrong.
Many thanks for that.
Why is that?
The project is like a patchwork quilt.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I just wanted to point that out.
These are a necessity.
This is a linguistic question.




Subject: Recent maritime disasters


Will he defend this in the Council?
Does he support it or not?
Thank you for your reply.
Thank you.
The Minister is right.
Subject: Initiatives in favour of SMEs
What has to be done?
Is this our peace effort?
This is not in fact a question.
You did exactly the same earlier.
You are Greek!
Souda is in Greece!
Subject: Situation in Chechnya
You made a very long statement.
(The sitting was closed at 7 p.m.)
.


EBRD activities
What is the basic element binding them?
I think that there are two types.
The EBRD has a political mandate.
Why?
There is a great deal to be done.
We see this as a fundamental activity.
That is not all.
The balance-sheet is impressive.
Secondly, I endorse your priorities.
We cannot adopt divergent priorities.
We will support you in this approach.
Think of the Chernobyl disaster.
The first is in response to Mr Blak.
A simple yes or no will suffice.
But it will not.
Self-help is better.
Let us keep both feet on the ground.
I do not think so.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Regarding Amendment No 6:
Lebanon is just a stone's throw away.
We have therefore rejected this report.
Hugues Martin report (A5-0448/2002)
This change is not without risks.
That concludes voting time.
I commend this report to the House.
This is not just a Spanish problem.
I support what Mrs Attwooll has said.
The report is very defensive in tone.
Controls alone are not sufficient.
The debate is closed.
The debate is closed.
The question is whether this is enough.
The Council fully shares this view.
The aid is granted impartially.
The debate is closed.
Those poor people.

Why?
For oil.
Let us reopen our office.
Why?
For human rights and democracy.

Thank you, Commissioner Solbes Mira.
The debate is closed.
We also protest against that.
We do not know by whom.
No ransom has been demanded.
They did not need a white list.
Indifference makes us accomplices.
These are not terrorist attacks.
We have completely lost the plot.
It is time that Parliament woke up.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
We have reached the end of the agenda.
(The sitting was closed at 5.05 p.m.)
.
Resumption of the session
(The President cut off the speaker.)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause)
The first is undoubtedly Iraq.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Firstly, the low turn-out.
That is the first point to stress.
Force is the last resort.
Diplomacy must always be our method.
(Applause)
How can we deal with these problems?
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Laughter and Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Simply opening doors is not enough.
What became of the 8 500 litres of it?
(Applause)
Why?
War is not inevitable.
It was very interesting.
Why did he not do so before?
Do we have measures to deal with it?
Has the UN considered this?
This does not merit such rejoicing.
Beware of playing down war!
We must listen to public opinion.
(Applause)
Calm down!
(Applause)
There will be more than thirty of us.
We must not let them down!
(Applause)
What did we do?
Nobody!
Nobody intervened!
So, let us stay calm.
There is a problem, however.
Iran now possesses missiles.
Obviously not!
That would be too dangerous.
Of course not!
That would be too dangerous.
That is the truth.
That is why we must step back.
So we have time.
We can wait a year.
Let us change the agenda.
(Applause)
In fact the opposite is true.
The warmonger is Bush, the democrat.
Please, let us not be hypocritical!
It is no easy task.
Iraq must pull itself together.
We also have another task.
I, for my part, do not.
Can you see anyone saying 'Yes to war'?
What will Europe propose?
That is his opinion!
I can see some logic in all this.
We radicals have presented a proposal.
What are we suggesting?

The gap will grow.
Europeans are not at all convinced.
We reject the logic of inevitable war.
We have the time, Saddam does not.
That is true wisdom.
I turn to weapons of mass destruction.
What are the consequences?
Millions of refugees.
It is killing the Iraqi people.
Make no mistake, this war is about oil.
I say to Mr Bush: pull my other leg!
So much for democracy.
Truly a war of civilisations.
May God helps us all!
I think that is very sad.
It is not the other way round.
That is the choice.
There are many other proposals.
The same applies to nerve gas.
The report continues in this vein.
It has been afraid since 11 September.
It has waged war on every continent.
Let America listen to her!
We are forced to take note of it.
That is no reason to be unilateral.
And what are we doing about it?
Let me ask you one simple question.
No.
And nobody listened to us.
Mr President, I am ashamed today!
Is it worth the cost?
I am saying no to unilateral war.
War is a failure of politics.

We must give the inspectors more time.
Mr President, war is a grave thing.


We must give peace another chance.
Thank you.
Will we achieve a good outcome?
Let us hope that it is for good.
The oil in Iraq changes nothing.



No!
I do not think so.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Secondly, the United States.
The world is more evil than that.
It is a veritable holocaust.
The right to defence must be preserved.
The figure for 2001 was 16%.
The situation is very alarming.
I therefore support this amendment.
End of quote.
That is not good budgeting!
In the long term, that is just not on.
The debate is closed.
What experience have we had since 1996?
There is clearly room for improvement.
What improvements do we want to see?
Let me, though, make one thing clear.
This is not acceptable.
The debate is closed.
.

The debate is closed.
This is not true.
.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.12 p.m.)
We would then transcend mere words.
The figures speak for themselves.
Hunger cannot wait.
A two-pronged approach is called for.
I do not refer simply to food aid.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Hypocrisy cannot be condoned though.
That must not be.
They are real people, not dummies.
They have a pain threshold.
This must not be forgotten.
Are we going to support him?
We all have a responsibility.
As I say, I share the analysis.
They do not get services as such.
It is another layer, so to speak.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I have two thoughts on the issue.
Nearly six million people have died.
So why the reference to poor countries?
A win-win situation.
We carry some responsibility for that.
The debate is closed.
I vote against.
We will make a note of that.
Joint motion for a resolution
Before the vote on paragraph 13:
Before the vote on paragraph 4:
Mr President, what an honour!
.
.
This is another democratic deficit.
What colour would you like the gates?'
Hence my positive vote.
.

The snow was falling in large flakes.
.
.
.
.
.
This is a significant step forward.
.
.
.
.
.
They will need time for that.
That is surely right.
These are the three characteristics.
We say: 'Freedom for Iraq!
A free I-raq!'
.
.
.
.
This is why I abstained on this text.
Iraq is rich in petroleum.
Saddam Hussein is a cruel dictator.
.
.
We want to talk.
We want to negotiate.
.
.
He prefers legal plundering.
And now, bon app√©tit!
.
.
(The sitting was closed at 12.20 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Are there any comments?
The following change has been proposed:
WEDNESDAY:
(Parliament agreed to the request)
Wonderful!
We can do that, Mr Leinen.

No more using the UN to legalise force!
This crime can be avoided.
No, I will not do that.
No, it is not a point for plenary.
You may take it up with me privately.
That concludes the item.
We need both.
We are drawing closer together.
Europe can make a difference.
There is no need to shy away from this.
We must respond.
We must be bolder.
Do we have the courage to do it or not?
Allow me to address a couple of issues.
Trade is important, of course.
It therefore represents hope.
I shall cite three examples.
There is certainly no way back.
The sea represents life itself.
The theory is now belied by the facts.
I am sorry.
The Union's position remains the same.
We must make progress.
This is an incredibly important issue.
Neither is an adequate solution.
This is inadequate!
It has still not been solved.
So: this far and no further.
Not commerce.
Necessity knows no law.
That is my first point.
That was not the intention at Doha.
I will now move on to my second point.
Please speak for the people of Europe.
This stance is not merely unfortunate.
Will it solve all our problems?
What do we do then?
I just cannot understand its attitude.
And this is not always the case.
And our dependency stands at 75%.
There are good reasons for this.
However, this is clearly not the case.
This protection must be transparent.
We must stand firm.
They cannot be sidelined.
But let us call it as it is.

Then there is the USA, of course.
This places us in an enormous dilemma.
It concerns knowledge.
It is nothing new.
There are moreover precedents for this.
Chiquita collapsed just like Enron.

This is no mean feat.
It is a very difficult balancing act.
We have flexibility.
No, thank you.
Specific proposals?
Yes, please'.
I do not believe that we are.
This in itself is excellent news.
Mr Martinez is right on this point.
Goods are bought and sold.
This is not discussed.
.
We feel this needs correcting.
That is not acceptable.

This is now being simplified.
I find that rather far-fetched.
So let us keep it in perspective.
I agree with this wholeheartedly.
That is really badly thought through.
This is our request.
We are not lawyers or barristers.
This is a welcome proposal.
How, today, do we define the family?
Imagine what it must feel like.
The rules must also be generous.
That is the heart of the issue.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at midday.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (ARTICLE 120)
This is very much a step forward.
We have to move the debate forward.
Yes, Mrs Terr√≥n i Cus√≠ is right.
Where, however, is the difficulty?
We must be prudent.
On that we all agree.
We agree on that as well.
Thus far, we are all of one mind.
I recognise this is a difficult debate.
There is no right to immigration.
Immigration is only a possibility.
Our proposal states that very clearly.
We congratulate the rapporteur.
The debate is closed.


This is what our proposal is aimed at.
This is of course unacceptable.
However, he is no Saddam Hussein.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the vote.
Before the vote:
.
Before the vote on Amendment No 5:
Before the vote on Amendment No 3:
Amendment No 6 rests on that.
That does not help.
Is that correct?
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
.

.
.
.
.
Hence our vote in favour.
.
.
.
Hence my vote against.
.

.
.
.
.
.
There are many other examples.



Quite the opposite.
When and where will they stop?
I am not sure.
The debate is closed.
We have consulted the Ministers.
I have two urgent requests.
This is not the case.
They were an instrument.
That may well be so.
We are waiting, however!
We want all those things, too.
They are even worse off.
In no way can you justify that!
That has to be weighed in the balance.
You kept on wanting cross-subsidies.
Those are the facts of the matter.

I invite them to reflect on this.
We will make no progress at all!

That amounts to an increase of 73%.
That would also raise problems.
Those are the solutions.
We do not have many months.
I say this to everyone.
The debate is closed.


Safety cannot be conditional.
Also by the Council.
Alright.
Now we must act.
We will resume it at 9 p.m.
Commissioner Schreyer has the floor.
We propose that this be left unchanged.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
Is this correct?
Now for my second question.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
Part I
.
Subject: The MEDA Programme and women
Part II
Questions to Commissioner Solbes
My reply will be very quick.
Questions to Commissioner Lamy
What is the cause of this collapse?
What can we do?
It is a complex, multi-faceted issue.
We must therefore change this.
Would you consider renaming?
They did not lead to an agreement.
I have three supplementary questions.
It will need some backing up.
That happens from time to time.
It is a question of credibility for us.
Everything took place transparently.
No, of course not.
This is not a change.
It in no way alters the preferences.
It simply does not make sense.
We are talking about thousands of jobs.
There are two parts to this problem.
This would have two impacts.
The figures are indeed worrying.

With reference to Directive 2002/73/EC
A supplementary question.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We must be realistic, however.
That is very disappointing.
First, the agency.
I did not envy the rapporteur.
So it is time to choose.
Are we really making a choice?
It is a sectoral approach.
I cannot agree with that at all.
Final point: pricing.
Its implementation seems less easy.
Fifthly, road safety.
But let us not have yet another agency!

Better late than never.
The White Paper makes plans for 2010.
The Commission must move in this area.
This is a missed opportunity.
That is important.
We must improve road safety in the EU.
I hope that it will be in place soon.
Naturally, that is out of date today.
We could probably do more.
Lastly, the third aspect: our regions.
That is one of our group's concerns.
Firstly, the road safety agency.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
This is actually rather a sad moment.
It is highly complex.
The first models are ready.
It can exist.
This number of licences is sufficient.
.
That is very important.
.
Thank you Commissioner.
It will be better for the Chairman too.
What is important about this proposal?
We want that exemption to continue.
It clarifies Parliament's position.
I hope this will be supported.
All of that is to be commended.
Mrs Auroi had a very difficult task.
I congratulate her.
Turning now to 3G.
This has happened too little to date.
More realistic targets should be set.
That is democracy.
Let us not underestimate it.
Perhaps the very air we breathe?
This comes at a very important time.
For two reasons.
What happens?
Nothing.
Click again.
What happens?
Nothing.
What do we need?
That is a very wise decision.
Thank you Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
.
At such times, trust is won or lost.
This too is a goal we ourselves set.
There is no leeway.
(Applause)
Therein lies the main problem.
We need it.
Our Europe does not deserve that.
The answer is no.
Who is discussing energy tax reforms?
And so on, and so on.

We need to look at this clearly.
So there is a win-win situation.
That is what we must do.
Where is the evaluation?
The first is to do with Lisbon itself.
It does not.
What, however, can we do about it now?
They are negative.
I think that that is very important.
Can an end not be put to this?
We are lagging behind in this field.
Others are doing poorly.
This is a crisis across Europe.
Some countries do well in clustering.
If anything, they will make it worse.
Why am I worried?
That is what I, in any case, believe.
Even more redundancies?
Even more damage to the environment?
Most Members add further dimensions.
That is quite right.
This optimism is sorely needed.
We must stop apportioning blame.
It is not simple.
At worst, it has not made any headway.
Or has all this now been forgotten?
There is quite simply no Europe at all.
So spot the mistake!
Let me explain myself.
And that is very, very important.
Otherwise we shall achieve nothing.
No one objective takes precedence.
.
.
.
.
.
.
This is why I voted for the report.
.
They have convinced me finally.
.
.
.
.
'I am sure there will', I replied.
.
.
.
.

I therefore voted against the report.
.
.
We need it urgently!
Item 66:
Item 79:
Amendment No 26:
This proposal is far too detailed.
.
.
- (FR) I voted in favour of the report.
That is not emphasised in the proposal.
.
.
.
.
.
Specialists are asking questions.
It is easy to see why.
.
What about pensioners?
.

.
.
.
.
.
.
.
I therefore voted against it.
.
The sitting is suspended



We hope it will not be the latter.
We need unity in the European Union.
This is a moment of truth.
This is a most serious situation.
(Applause)
(Applause from the right, heckling)
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Loud applause)


This must be explained.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Let us keep it there.
What they told us makes good sense.

History has not yet been written.
(Applause)
This is the crux of the issue.
That person is Saddam Hussein.
And what does that mean, pray?
Peace for whom?
For the oppressed Iraqis?

There are many possibilities for this.
(Applause)
Good luck!
(Applause)
(Applause)
It is not clear.
There would be a danger of civil war.
We are still waiting.

What does that mean in terms of Iraq?
We do not!
(Loud applause)
Unlike Iraq, we are democracies.
We need compliance by Saddam Hussein.
They are all serious questions.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATIONS (RULE 120)
We very much support that.
I do not see that such is the case.
I believe that this is really positive.
I do not understand.
It is quite frightening.
The criticism is justified.
Very good!
That is something I can only endorse.
So what is the situation today?
What does the Council do?
Do not take what I say too personally.
Such, though, is not the case.
That was 20 years ago tomorrow.
This must be stated categorically.
This is not for ideological reasons.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be held on 11 March.
The second Convention is very explicit.
This is what my group is seeking.
That was the first aspect.
The subject speaks for itself.
These are known as arrow shells.
I am not reassured on that point yet.
Thankfully we have done away with that.
This is extremely serious.
It is wild scaremongering.
I will mention just three facts.
The facts are there.
They are not right methodologies.
Thank you, Mr President.
The debate is closed.
For that I thank you sincerely.
Neither plants nor animals survive.
I would like to raise two points.
I eagerly await your response.
The situation is very grave.
They also die from unsafe abortions.
(Applause from the Left)
I am pro-choice.
(Applause from the Left)
This I absolutely support.
The Commission welcomes them.
This is the purpose of all this.
I advise that we stay on track.
(Applause)
That was my well-intentioned warning.
.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
This recommendation does exactly that.
I welcome this report.
It often results in fatal accidents.
Testing can reduce the health risks.
It is all complete nonsense.
It is a vicious and cruel approach.
The trend is in the wrong direction.
This is the way we should be going.
.
Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
Personal privacy must be protected.
They are needed to reconstruct breasts.
She sends her apologies.
That is crucial.
Finally, protecting the patient.
I am very satisfied with the report.
That delay set us back years.
Why?
Because they affect people's health.
For whom actually?
And what for?
.
.
.
.
That concludes voting time.
.
.
.
.
.
.
That is a good thing!
.
We must respond to this.
.
.
I abstained from voting on this report.
.
.
.
.
Let us take the example of Caesareans.
Is this Europe's business?
.
It could not have been put any better.
Commissioner Byrne has the floor.
It goes back 25 years.
Who is responsible?
Who should pay?
Let us think about that.
How do you expect that to work?
We entirely support it.
That it what is heinous, Commissioner.
But who is it trying to fool?
Nor indeed are state aids possible.
We all know that.
That is indeed the case.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Kazakhstan must not slip on its road.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The debate is closed.
He is opposing the resolution.
Free, honest elections are needed soon.
Fear currently prevails in the country.
It is not, at the moment, the only one.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
.
.
This is not the issue.
Resumption of the session
That is why we oppose a new resolution.
Thank you, Mr President.
I would definitely welcome that.
You could at least be consistent!
(Applause from the right)
That, eventually, was the good news.
We will follow that up for you.
I would like to know why.

I am sure the Rules were complied with.
I have no quarrel with that.
I take note of your point.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I am sorry to interrupt.
We are running over the allotted time.
What are our objectives?
I may come back to them later.
First of all, energy services.
Another aspect is education.
We must also provide our own training.
That is my first question.
Secondly, the mandate.
Finally, development.
Let us look at the figures.
A moratorium is not a good idea.
Why these fields and not others?
It is right to anticipate that.
Far from it!
That is what we want to encourage.
Let us be positive about it.
Let us move ahead!
(The President cut off the speaker)
Culture is not just another commodity.
There are a number of reasons for this.
The Treaty now provides for this.
They have not said that up to now.

I, for one, find it incomprehensible.
We have nothing against these people.
We believe this to be wrong.
Thank you, Mr President.
That is something we urgently need.
Everyone has commented on it.
Well, I am waiting for an evaluation!
We have been waiting for a while now.
We are still waiting for this.
Please can we link these two matters.
I oppose it.
Firstly, self-handling.
Sufficient guarantees can be built in.
The same must apply to self-handling.
This is transparent competition.
Thank you, Mr President.
Why?
That could have been enlightening.
So why did we not vote it out?
What can I add in a minute?
Nobody is asking for this.
That is all we need.
So they can choose for themselves.
Yes or no?
It bears no relation.
One, what does self-handling mean?
Let us tell the truth, please.
Nobody is proposing social dumping.
That is simply the European model.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (ARTICLE 120)
Finally, I will mention Amendment No 2.

Why?
These must not be forgotten.

The promise had been made by others.

Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
It issued a favourable opinion.
The industry will go into free fall.
Please heed their call.
Fishing is an economic activity.

We must acknowledge this.
We can already feel the effects.
I urge everybody to support this.
There must be a balance in the stocks.
This is worse than we thought.
Let us not forget it!
But how?
Please take note!
But this time it is extremely serious.
That was done in a cooperative way.
But what is the future to be?
It is precisely the reverse.
There is no way round this.
(The sitting was closed at 10.29 p.m.)
Opening of the session
(The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)
We will do that.
Let me start with enlargement today.
Here I refer to the western Balkans.
Absolutely not.
What kind of Europe do we want?
What guideline are we following?
This brings me to the Convention.
Together, we can succeed.
It is an historic and unique occasion.
First I shall deal with the substance.
We still find irritations here.
We would like to see that document.
That was a mistake and a failure.
Let me give you an example.
This really leaves me dumbfounded.
We shall have to look into this.
Is that not excessive?
(NL) Thank you, Mr President.
We have just appointed a new Ombudsman.
My group fully endorses the report.
We are on the threshold of enlargement.
We want enlargement.
That is something we cannot accept.
(The President cut off the speaker)
There is no functional justification.
That starts with administration.
Many issues are still outstanding.
This should be a dialogue.
It has been a huge undertaking.
There are no discounts.
There is absolutely no leeway on this.
This cannot go unnoticed.
Thank you, President Prodi.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
That is quite clear.
Thank you for your attention.
His is an excellent report.
Several points are now obsolete.
This cannot be allowed to continue.
This is bad for democratic control.
The result is unhealthy populism.
The two matters must go hand in hand.
It should be abolished!
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Mr Muis did not attend last night.
(Mixed reactions)
(Mixed reactions)
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote on Amendment No 48:
(Loud applause)
Before the vote on Amendment No 16:
Before the vote on Amendment No 45:
The rapporteur seems adamant.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote on Amendment No 8:
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
Naturally, I fully support this report.
.
.
.

.
The risks of social dumping are clear.
.

.
.
.
.
The second point is more complicated.
That would benefit no one.
.
.
.
.
Were we too ambitious, too euphoric?
The one is inseparable from the other.
Another important point is partnership.
How is that possible?
That is a very interesting question.
That is the way to bring it together.
That would be a welcome step forward.
In short, nothing has happened.

I would like to end with a comment.
Women also need support.
That is backtracking.
My third point has to do with women.
The debate is closed.
Such improvement should be substantial.
We differ on this in two respects.
It is absolutely obvious.
You have shied away from it!
We therefore do have enough time.
It has also been severely criticised.
The present rules must be reformed.
Why?
This is unacceptable.
Mr President, I shall be brief.
I sympathise with these views.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place next Thursday.
Question Time will follow at 5.45 p.m.

The objective is twofold.
There are various possibilities.
It is not easy.
We have tried it in the past.
We must be perfectly clear about this.
I really only have one question.
Membership is something different.
There is no longer an iron curtain.
There is no exclusion any more.
I would like to ask two questions.
I think this is an important point.
He raised a couple of points.
He also referred to the Balkans.
The debate is closed.
Part I
We can only warmly welcome this.
That is the only thing that we can do.
I then went to another meeting.
I know all of this.
I hope I pronounced that correctly.
That is the connection.
We are acting on this matter.
In his answer to Question E-1695/02
Have I understood that properly?
Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) 2341/2002
Can you be more specific?
How can we guarantee that?
How can it be controlled?


But it says something further.

Some even hoped that it would.
EMU has been very successful.
Nothing at all would have become of it.


Europe must devise a policy of her own.
.
Nor must we now go back on that.
The Treaty is not being respected.
Sweden has a well-run economy.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Will this remedy kill the patient?
This has not happened, however.
We are not setting new objectives.
We say 'yes' to competition policy.
We say 'yes' to a benchmark.
We must learn from each other.
These are basically good rules.
The same applies to state finances.
Now is the time for action.
Clearly there is room for improvement.
Growth and stability are twin pillars.
They are both in our synthesis report.
I believe not.
And this is true.
The debate is closed.
This directive is not the end product.
It is a first step.


What matters, rather, is the content.
This is a vast potential market.
Overall this is an excellent measure.
I commend it to the House.
This is absolutely clear.
It is not a form of saving.
Pensions are for life.
That is certainly true.
Finally, Mr President, the tax issue.
We have recently had the Danner ruling.
That is a subject for social policy.
The status quo is not an option.
Compromise was very necessary.
That is a statement of fact.
That is an important minimum.
What do old people want?
Security, independence and autonomy.
I say 'of being able to', please note.
We ourselves have to take care of it.
At least it is an agreed text.
That is a clear case of discrimination.
That is a good thing.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
Iraq
Please sit down and remove the banners.
This is where Europe has a voice.
You know what they are.
This close collaboration is ongoing.
So we are also working with them.
Europe is a community of values.
(Applause)
But that is not my point.
It seems pretty obvious to me.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
What happens if there is a war in Iraq?
I want to ask two questions.
We have been told that will happen.
I sincerely hope that is so.
(Applause from the centre and the left)
(Applause)
That is at the heart of the problem.
(Applause)
The same will be true now.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Why?
(Applause)
(Applause)
That is our second trump card.
What, then, did our US friends tell us?
I do not understand it.
That is very good, that is excellent.
What, then, are we doing with Turkey?
I simply do not understand it.
Obviously, they will find it fantastic!
(Applause from the left)
That would be a stupid position.
It was the Al Qaeda organisation.
The answer is no, there is no proof.
That is extremely worrying.
I believe that there is.
(Mixed reactions)
(Applause from the right)
Now, the drumbeats of war can be heard.
Hopefully, war can still be averted.
Mr President, what is this war about?
We do not like Saddam Hussein.
That is unfortunately not the case.
History will be the judge.
Thank you.
Why?
(The President cut off the speaker)
The Iraqi people are innocent.
The reactions will be terrible.
They have already begun.
We must preserve peace.
Thank you.
We believe that there will be one.
We believe that war is avoidable.
If there is war, it will be a disaster.
(The President cut off the speaker)
What an admission that is!
The veto is now on the streets.
They deserve our respect.
That is not a success.
But for how long?
Is that not a sign of what is to come?
The future of the world is at stake.
If we do not we are lost.
We must bar the road to ruin!
Does Iraq possess the smallpox virus?
Here lies Europe's great mission.

The disarmament of Iraq is underway.
So speaks the United Nations.
However, we do have a common position.
What happens next?
It rests with the Security Council.
What are the threats today?
(Applause)
We want the Turkish Cypriots with us.
We want them here in this Chamber.
(Applause)
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
The next item is the vote
That seems rather like haggling.
Work that out if you can.
Why is this so?
Thank you.
You did not disappoint us.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
Joint motion for a resolution
We very much appreciate this effort.
.
.
.
.
.
.
We reject this forced takeover.
.
.
It should also be public.
.
.
We voted against it.
.
Everything is a commodity.
Let it be taken up.
.

.
.
.
.
.
.
Hence our vote against the report.
.
.
.
That approach is unacceptable.
.
.
Are there any comments?
(?he Minutes were approved)
These efforts have been paying off.
Our objectives are clear.
Thank you very much Mr President.
I refuse to do that.
We cannot go on this way.
It is using NATO resources.
Peace has not yet been established.
Sadly, it has not worked.
Finally, to the funding of the mission.

It had no intention to conceal.
We only have a short time.
This is the first step in the process.
These discussions are necessary.
Why are they necessary?
Are such transfers legal?
That I think is a major step forward.
I wonder how this is possible.

Therefore it is academic.

How can this be?
The international police?
How humiliating is that?
What does that mean?

So this is a very serious matter.
That would be absurd.
This too is totally unacceptable.
He needs to get a sense of proportion.
Our points of view are oceans apart.
What is at issue here?
The aim is to protect people.


The American side has accepted that.
We have not yet achieved an agreement.
That is true.
It is happening now.
All I want is an answer.
It is Security Council Resolution 1244.
We can see what has happened.
Subject: Guantanamo Bay
Negotiations are still under way.
Subject: Maritime transport
I share Mrs Riitta Myller's concerns.
What initiative does it intend to take?
I have just two comments.
Is this possible?
Subject: Flags of convenience
I must stress this.
Why not give this a try?
I agree with the speaker.
Greece has an extensive coastline.
I admit that is asking a lot of you.
Very possibly.
Subject: Enlargement

Thank you for your question.
Why?
No, that is not how it is.
We must keep on beating the drum.
Good work has been done.

This is due to be completed shortly.
This is a key moment.
We really are at a turning point now.
This is a total perversion of justice.
This is all we are calling for.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed 11.10 p.m.)
Consumer Policy Strategy 2002-2006
I now turn to the report by Mrs Patrie.
All of us agree with that.
Let us not be over-confident, however.
.
I can only express my thanks for that.
Point two, the right to information.
Or take the euro, another example.
Of course, things can go against us.
Every consumer understands that.
Or nowhere in fact?
Thank you very much.
We can kill two birds with one stone.
That is not easy.
Just think about changing your bank.
How could we ensure their durability?

(The President cut off the speaker)
He wrote in his own language, English.
We need all these things.
That, again, does not add up to much.
I turn, briefly, to mutual recognition.
I know people are calling for it.
We are looking at this.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at noon.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
.
.
.
.
.

This is completely unacceptable.
1.
2.

Hence our vote in favour of the report.
.
Hence our vote against the report.
.
Hence my vote in favour of this report.
It will be noted in the Minutes.
Thank you for pointing that out.
Commissioner Fischler has the floor.
The other case is as follows.
Something must be done urgently.

In such cases, no new jobs are created.
That is why I want to contribute.
That is the reality.
What are we going to do about it?
Nothing.
That is the decisive factor.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
This must be condemned.
The US shares this view.

Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We are seeing this with Iraq.
We have been at this for years.
What have we to show for all this?


It must also undertake to pursue ?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We are out of our minds with worry.
Mr President, Commissioner.
I raised it in my group.
It is not a feminist issue either.
I am grateful for that.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in a moment.
EXPLANATION OF VOTE
That was the last item on the agenda.
(The sitting was closed at 5.25 p.m.)
Welcome
Mr President, I endorse this statement.
(Applause from the left)
Luckily, there is unanimity here too.
Of that there can be no doubt.
(Laughter and applause)
President.
Or even university chancellors!
Patten, Commission.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
We should redouble our efforts.
We must remain true to it.
(Applause)
I should like to add one point here.
(Applause)
(Applause)


(Applause)
(Applause from the left)
And that is our responsibility.
(Applause from the left)
We are loyal partners and not servants.
(Applause from the left)
That is absolutely absurd.
(Applause from the left)
This is unacceptable.
(Applause from the left)
We must live in a positive way.
(Applause from the left)
This is an essential point.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, this is not a just war.
(Applause from the ELDR Group)
The eviction of Saddam Hussein?
But then what?
(Applause from the left)
(Applause from the left)
This is what they expect of us.
(Applause from the left)
The United Nations has not failed.
This they have clearly failed to do.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
The second message concerns ourselves.
(Applause)
This is not true, ladies and gentlemen!
The European Union is deeply divided.
That is the reality of the situation.
We shall have to resolve to do this.
Everything else is incidental.
Will we have the strength?
You say we are acting unlawfully?
As unlawfully as de Gaulle.
You are as law-abiding as Vichy!
Cowardly Europe, Vichy's Europe!
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the left)
That has to be said first.
(Applause from the left)
(Applause from the left)
These are facts.
What must our agenda be?
Long live the Iraqi nation!
And long live France!'
(Applause from the right)
In 1991, there was the UN.
A great deal of damage has been done.
We have lost.
(Applause)
Have we forgotten September 11 already?
Bush wanted this war.
International trade has slowed down.
(Applause from the right)
Question one: where to now?
Down with war!
Long live peace between nations!
(Applause from the right)
Here too the perceptions have differed.
That is not where the problem lies.
A community of principles.
It seems pretty obvious to me.'
Indeed it does seem obvious.
(Applause)
(Applause)

I do not doubt that at all.
(Applause)



Resumption of the session
The European Council issued guidelines.
What are they?
On the contrary, the divisions widened.
Could we discuss this sort of agenda?
No, it is not.
There was no point in discussing it.
Yes, it is.
But that is not strictly true.
(Mixed reactions)
You are perfectly correct.
Let us start with security.
Today, history is repeating itself.

(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
There must be no more victims.
I support Mr Annan.
(Applause)
(Applause)
I hope your consciences are stirred.
They wish to enjoy freedom and dignity.
I could not agree more.
That is not the way forward.
(Applause)
He will speak on the Spring Council.
(Applause)
Humanitarian aid must get through.
That much is clear.
I urge them to stop and think.
Right is on your side.
They have every right to do so.
(Applause)
It is actually quite easy to solve.
That much is plain.
That is the plain truth!
(Applause)
That is a historical fact.
One must call a spade a spade.
(Applause)
So what?
It is far more complex.
That is the crux of the issue.
There has been much talk of one.
Why not?
Why not say ethical, Dany?
Me!


Yet we are treated to empty words.
The Presidency is not to blame.
Unfortunately, it did not do so.
We must be enterprise-friendly.
That was almost surreal.
Robert Kagan might be proved right.
Is that really our aim?
It is now time for deeds.
That is where our duty lies.
We need a common foreign policy.
A paradox?
No.
With this war, the masks have come off.
What can and should we do?
(Applause from the left)
The war is happening.
It is an event of major significance.
That was a lie.
This has now been revealed.
That was a lie.
The Security Council was not stalled.
Iraq was supposed to be weakened.
That proved to be another lie.
That too was a lie.
Sadly it is justified.
I believe in calling a spade a spade.
Iraq remained a festering sore.
There is no sign of peace there.
Who is not still embarrassed by that?
I find that a good left-wing stance.
But what is the presidency's role?
Are there only a few?
Yes! There are only a few.
We have to make that effort.
And it is up to us.
It is important to remain level-headed.
The Iraqi people have suffered enough.
It is also, unfortunately, barbaric.
President Bush has spoken of a crusade.
This policy will not go unanswered.
We agree with the Council on this.
I congratulate it on that.
The UN Charter has been flouted.
That is a frightening thought.
Our leaders are letting us down.
The future of Europe depends on it.
Then there is the Middle East.
We do not think this is the case.
Every day it shows us its real face.
They have responded with deep tax cuts.
There are no short cuts.
(Applause from the left)
Good for him.
I would like to discuss three things.
This is called 'coherence of policy'.
The third point concerns pensions.
To date, it has not been completed.
Where is the actual timetable?
Where are the detailed objectives?
Where is the road map?
Let me now turn to Iraq.
Are they fundamental reasons?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
I do not understand the Council.
Those are not threats, but statements.
That is what we are doing.
We consider it as a joint objective.
What nonsense is this?
I do not have much faith in that.
I find it quite intolerable.
That is exactly what happened here.
Allow me to give an example.
At the moment, I do not trust them.
The debate is closed.
What about the new principles?
It was a good basis on which to build.
Indeed, this is the aim of the reforms.
That document has been circulated.

Now are putting our own House in order.
These amendments are very positive.
The Commissioner also referred to it.
The debate is closed.
.
Then there is the cost.
I also agree with her analysis of GMOs.
That is to be welcomed.
It is as simple as that.
We can do that if we want to.
We can, however, cut down on their use.
I also try not to do that myself.
I am not stupid, I know that too.
Why do we need these taxes?
That is one of the many challenges.
The debate is closed.
We need a new system.
We need a new chemicals policy.
The debate is closed.
Why not?
Where are the log jams?
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
That is the idea behind the proposal.
This is clearly counter-productive.
This is innovation.
What have the Member States done?
It is a vicious circle.
A new kind of cooperation is needed.

That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 11 a.m. today.
The time is ripe.
As I said, the time is ripe.
In these areas we can only coordinate.


That is the risk.
This is being discussed.
That also has to be made very clear.
We know everything is not yet perfect.
I find all this unacceptable.
These are basic issues.
Is there a public demand for this?
No.
Will it be more efficient?
No.
No.
That is where I am coming from.
That is the 'hole'.
The answer is to stop digging.
Stop giving the Community money.
Attack the cause, not the system.
We need more internal reforms.


The current system does not work.

I do not see it this way at all.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place shortly.
(Applause)
I support it on behalf of my group.
(Applause)
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
I look forward to that final vote.
It is highly ambiguous.
.
.
But sadly this is not the case.
You should do as we have done!'
.
That is our position.
.
.
.
.
There was a boxing ring.
You did not want to raise it.
You did not want a resolution.
This is a dark day for Parliament.
He would do better to stay away.
.
.

.

.
.
. (FR) I voted for this report.
This is clearly not the case.
.
.
'But of course we are!
Not a problem!
- (SV) I voted in favour of the report.
Something must be done.
That concludes the votes.
(The sitting was closed at 1p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Monday
Wednesday
It is now disastrous.
It is not news.
This, to us, is a responsible attitude.
EU alleges Israel was spy.'
Stop the killing'.
That is incorrect.
Where does it come from?
How does it spread?
How can we stop it?

This is a key lesson for the future.
The centre will enhance surveillance.
It says:
I do not believe that they will.
We are eager to find out!
No!
At this stage, what can be said?
SARS is a very serious problem.
We do not, however, know that for sure.
There is no applicable treatment.
They are:
I am also concerned about it.
We need to change that.
The debate is closed.
The programmes are no longer so rigid.
I hardly think so.
That too is reflected in the directive.
That is not possible.
It would be just too risky.
My proposals now simply go too far.
We want to improve road safety.
I will not go into all the details.
It is as follows.
I will be coming back to this.
There is a difference.
Why is this one of the key factors?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I would like to thank them for that.
For what can we still be a motor?
That cannot work without education.
We have to show our colours!
That is what is expected of Europe!
That is an obstacle.
The debate is closed.
This programme has three main pillars.
We must not neglect these people.
I fully support the budget increase.
Can it also be used for this?
Yes.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.48 p.m.)
2001 discharge procedure
We are still waiting.
That is not the case at present.

We shall examine the results closely.
It starts with the most important news.
My report has 120 sections.
This is beyond our control.
I think we should reward it for that.
The remaining agencies must wait.
But is that enough?
No, it is not.
The first is Palestine.
The second is the KEDO programme.
The situation is indeed alarming.
We all know what that means.
I really cannot understand this.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
I ask you to vote in favour.
It is important to note that.
Nor could we do that.
Consequently, we recommend discharge.
That is unacceptable.
We were not equal to the task.
That was an injustice.
Instead, they dismissed Mrs Andreasen.
The test has not been passed.
We have no right to grant discharge.
It takes time.
We have overcome a difficult hurdle.
We trust you also with this exercise.
OLAF is doing its work very well here.
Do you know what super users are?
We have such things in our agencies.
It must be stopped.
One last point.
That is not the way.
We are convinced it is not.
The internal auditor said three things.
There are more such cases.
We do not need them.
Mr Casaca has done a very good job.
We have to remember that context.
We are interested in delivery.
The right wing must listen.
That was in 2001.
I utterly reject this insult.
That concludes the debate.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)

Before the vote:
.
.
.
We do not agree.
.
.
.
These aspects have been crucial in ...
.
.
.
.
.

greater intercultural dialogue
language learning
the exchange of good practices.
.
.
.
.
.
(PT) I voted in favour of this report.
.
This is what you must say!'
And that is what I am saying.
This is a shrewd piece of work.
Is this really logical?
I would put this question to Mr Pirker.
I cannot do that.
I must honestly admit that I cannot.
This is not true!

This resolution got off to a bad start.
I could almost believe it.
Harm reduction alone is not a solution.
This was the great slogan.
We paid for helicopters and armies.
This report states a basic position.
It will not work.
There is no easy solution.
We know what he is after.
You should reject the resolution.
This is something I cannot accept.

I do not think much of that.
They have hope.
This I cannot agree to.
This policy has had good results.
We need to review the UN Conventions.
What message do you have?
Is the Dutch model the modern one?
The debate is closed.
She had a very difficult job to do.
Would this not be more practical?
A child is a child.
What a joke!
But the floodgates have been opened.
They have for all applicants.
All of this must stop.
Their tactics are clear.
I adore my wife.
What is the new structure?
These reforms relate to people's needs.
A change of policy is therefore needed.
Of course stability is a public good!
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
Mr President, I have three questions.
Could he perhaps repeat it?
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulos.
Mr President, I will reply quickly.
I would ask you to be brief.
Part I
If not why not?
This is a serious problem.
Why this change?
Does the Commission intend to renew it?
We do not think so.
You can express a contrary view.
Until when?
Finally, what will happen in 2004?
Subject: ECHO in Iraq
Such visits have now been suspended.
I would like to mention the main ones.
Thank you very much, Mr Nielson.
Part II
Questions to Commissioner Liikanen
So there is still a great deal to do.
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
Questions to Commissioner Wallstr√∂m
In its opinion of 26 October 2000
This is clearly a cross-border problem.
When did they appeal to it?
Mr R√ºbig, your supplementary question.
We are at the moment.
This point is very important.
This was exactly the point.
We have such different views on this.
This is a completely different issue.
There is one on this issue.
I am fully aware of that.
Questions to Commissioner Vitorino
Subject: Common border policing
But the Council has not set a date.
Thank you very much.
Subject: Franco-German charter flight
Gladly, Mr Krivine.
That is the difference.
Collective expulsion is prohibited.
(Applause)
You can count on our support.
(The speaker began in Macedonian.
(The speaker continued in English)
Then, however, we managed to step back.
It has strong trade links with the EU.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We thank you.
Let me give you an example.
The debate is closed.
My eighth point follows on from this.
We are all in agreement.
Thank you very much, Mr Ceyhun.
I find this quite simply scandalous.
That Regulation must be applied.
I hope it will have your support.
Consequently, Europol is created.
The debate is closed.
The debate is closed.

No, they are not!
No, they are not!
Not satisfactorily so!
I do not believe it will.
Why not?
Euronews is a good objective.
What does this mean?
We have to get that message over.
We will succeed.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
Announcement by the President
I deeply appreciate those sentiments.
They are here to follow our debate.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Some have already expressed their will.



That adds up to a very good result.
The answer is perfectly clear.
(Applause)
Are we ourselves sufficiently prepared?
Both are approaching the goal.
(Applause)
That is what we want for our continent.
(Applause)


It is an historic day for Europe.
We therefore support enlargement.
Each country has its own history.
They want a better future.
We cannot have it both ways.
The situation is very simple.
Almost all members will vote in favour.
Now these have at last been regained.
I am delighted at this prospect.
Europe will be reunited.
I am highly optimistic about this.
Lithuania has its own problems.
We are all Europe.
Not new Europe and old Europe.
Malta has recognised this opportunity.
But that referendum is not binding.
I am speaking now as an Austrian.

.
They are not unique.
We have apparently been too impatient.
It takes time to tackle these problems.

It will not come by accident.
Today is a new beginning.
At least they were acceptable.
That has cost the Council money.
Warsaw has forgotten Europe's memories.
That is going too far!
Mr President, you are Greek.
Ten more countries is excessive.
Let there be an end to this.
(Applause)
There are several reasons for this.
The people of Europe are not ready.
How quickly Euro-regions materialised!
(Murmurs of dissent)
(Mixed reactions)
We do not really know each other yet.
The time has come for action.
(Loud sustained applause)
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENTS (RULE 120)
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
President.
(Applause)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote on Amendment No 19:
(Mixed reactions)
(Loud applause)
We want to determine our own seat.
(Loud applause)
Before the vote:
.
We therefore abstained on this report.
.
.
The Council must get out of that habit.
.

.
Why?
This assessment is misguided.
.
.
In other words, it is a pittance.
There is no mistaking the signs.
It will be fettered from the outset.
.
.
.
Promises given have not been honoured.
.
.
.
This is an historic day for Europe.
Europe is united in freedom.
.
Some of these are detailed below.
.
.
.
It is derisory.
.
.
It may also take place from the inside.
I hope this process will commence soon.
.
.
.
.
I hold the opposite view.
Europe needs freedom and flexibility.
It can do without ideology.
.
We must expect it to be long too.
We have no right to do so.
.
.
.
.
Monitoring too must be taken seriously.
And yet I voted in favour.
We must not upset this result today.
Our hope lies in the Convention.
.
That I cannot do.
I shall now give the second of these.
Try to get your minds round that one!
My mother died in January.
I cannot go along with that.
.
It can no longer be delayed.
Enlargement has already taken too long.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
That would still be very little.
.
.
.
.
The mind boggles!
This is yet another wasted opportunity.
.
.
.
.
.
I hope that they will soon come back.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
In our opinion, the situation is clear.
.
.
This is the second reason.
I am not sure.
He called this the gap of ambition.
They just need to decide to do so.
Where do we want to act?
What precisely do we need for it?
When do we want to do it?
This seems very good to me.
There's the rub!

Mr President, it is always the same.
Fifty years later, here we are again.
We have not made any progress.
Europe must be built on reality.
An enlarged Europe needs to be stable.
It is supported by 71% of them.
The war in Iraq has divided Europe.
This is a great threat to security.
We must act on this.
There is no other way forward.

What are we doing?
On that I congratulate Mr Morillon.
Why is that necessary?
That is quite appalling.
We must also be resolved and practical.
I think it should be put into effect.
The Morillon report is not a pipedream.
He deserves our thanks.
It is a standard reply, a cool reply.
And yet this war ended 54 years ago.
Do you intend to settle it soon?
That is another matter.
Despite this, I have reworded it.
I apologise for this.
This is not any other type of debate.
It has to do with freedom of movement.
Subject: Accession of Croatia to the EU
Mr President, thank you for your reply.
We need to apply pressure.
We need to apply far stronger pressure.
If so, how high is it on the agenda?
Is the Presidency of the Council?
If so, what is the Council's reaction?
I shall look into the matter.
If there was, I am very sorry.
Such individuals can act with impunity.
I agree with the honourable Member.
A solution has to be found.
Those are the reasons for my question.


Please answer the question.
.
(EL) I stand by what I said.
They are excluded from this proposal.
Some of the changes may be unhelpful.
Organs are for another day.
We must find a way to stop that.
We must get the balance right.
Our cells and tissues are not for sale.
The rapporteur has objections.
Donation must be non-remunerative.
We cannot awaken any false hopes here.
Investors were in expectant mood.
Has individuation occurred or not?
Am I not already killing?
Let me come first to Mrs Ries.
That is not a very coherent position.
We simply cannot push this any further.
This will take some time.
But I would ask you not to do so.
The debate is closed.
Fido and Kit are best off at home.
The debate is closed.

Amendments 7 to 11 cannot be accepted.
Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
Two amendments have been proposed.
That is a very dangerous precedent.
Why is that?
My second point refers to aspartame.
My third point concerns cyclamates.
Can Mr Byrne help us?
I think we must all take note of this.
We are in a vicious circle.
This is always a difficult task.
Let me clarify the following.
This is done from time to time.
Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.

Ours is an historic responsibility.

Detergents



There is work for us all to do here.


I am very happy about it.
That problem has been overcome.
It really can be done.
Then there is another problem.
Finally, on the subject of odours.
Okay, that is not what we have decided.
It is also a matter of public health.
I would ask one question, however.
We cannot leave it for another day.
We must act on that issue.
I do not believe that that is enough.
Consumers must be able to choose.

Labelling is only an initial step.
I hope that will happen.
Secondly, the criteria must be clear.

We have here a sensible proposal.
I will enumerate them later.
I will come back to phosphates later.
Fifthly, on derogations.
Finally on phosphates.
We therefore wanted a ban.
We must accept matters as they stand.
Thank you, Mr Bowe.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
In fact the problem is not just coffee.
You could survive on planting coffee.
Competition has become tougher.
Now it is less than eight cents.
We want a statement and an action plan.
Is the Commissioner going?
Is the Director-General going?
How can they get away with it?
This has been proven.
Parliament is full of hypocrites!
I could give any number of examples.
I will, however, make a few comments.
I am sure they will reply accordingly.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament approved the joint text)
(Parliament rejected the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote on Amendment 9:
That disrupts the legal system.
.
.
.
They are discovered.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
This contamination is uncontrollable.
.
.
.
.
How best do we serve this purpose?
.
.
.
.
.
The reality is unfortunately different.
.
.
Why not?
.
In fact, quite the opposite is true.
.
.
.
.
Defence is a national issue.
.
All that is contradictory.
We have to choose.
.
We therefore voted against this report.
.
.
.
We totally reject this approach.
.

What a peaceful future!
.
.
This would be unacceptable.
.
I am very grateful for this initiative.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
Four days later came the arrests.
The American boycott is ill-advised.
Cuba is crazy about dollars.
We must put a stop to this.
We are however saddened by them.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN EXPLANATION (RULE 120)
These events are no isolated incidents.
Do we listen?
No.
He was arrested, along with his friend.
Of course not.
Evolution is possible therefore.
I will now pass to other issues raised.
It is a rapidly evolving situation.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place now.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(The sitting was closed at 4.30 p.m.)
.
(ES) Europe is now almost reunited.
This is the case of Catalonia.
.
Resumption of the session
The following changes are proposed:
Tuesday
Mr President, this is about Wednesday.
Thursday
There are not enough MONUC soldiers.
I am talking about breast cancer.
I am sure Ireland is not alone in this.

Thank you.
That is disgusting and shameful.
What is happening?
That is all I can tell you.
I can tell you the facts of the matter.
There were no other conditions.
I will be happy to do so, Mr Staes.
(Protests from Mr Ortuondo Larrea)
I am not a magician!
You will have to speak tomorrow.
.
Enough about 'stupid' energy.
This programme will help.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
The second point is about the budget.
We welcome this.
I think it would have helped us.
It involves heavy, ongoing investment.
We must look far into the future.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
And why is all of this the case?
The remainder is sold on the network.
Congratulations, Commissioner.
My final note is one of caution.
Let me turn to the definitions.

Amendment No 42 is essential.
I hope that it can.
I wish to raise two concerns of my own.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Hopefully that confidence will return.
They do not have a problem with this.
There could be an added cost to them.
I feel we have achieved this.
There are still some areas of concern.
We debated them in committee.
That certainly is not my intention.
I also met with the insurers.
That is a shame.
It is overstretched.
In a real, insured aeroplane.
This is what is important.
What do I mean by rigidity?
We are working on this at the moment.
Thank you very much Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
.
Quite the opposite.
Why space, one might ask.
It shows the widespread support.
We need a permanent solution.
The reasons are obvious.
Otherwise we will lose them.
We must not dawdle on this, however.
Our credibility is at stake.
We must choose.
That is what we must seek.
At any rate, we will make the attempt.
Thank you for that clarification.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
(The sitting was suspended at 9 p.m.)
Decision on urgent procedure
We have voted on these.
No, most certainly not!
Under no circumstances!
This minimum must be reached.
We must not allow this to happen.
This is not acceptable.
On the contrary.
The second example is that of GMOs.
However, we have been deceived.
This House must make changes.
None of this is very radical.
(Applause from the left)
That is all I wanted to say to you.
This directive is vitally important.
How is this regulated at the moment?
It is completely unacceptable.
The two are complementary.
We refuse to accept this.
Why am I not happy?
I doubt it somehow.
I have my doubts about this.
There is a need for important changes.
This provides legal certainty.
It gives that very clear signal.
We want to see an insurance system.
What about the scope?
That was the starting-point.
Would that be a manageable system?
What about oil or marine pollution?
The polluter shall pay!
This is the only rule that can apply.
We have seen accident after accident.
This is not acceptable.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
.
This is based on voluntariness.

It is a voluntary agreement.
The same goes for the PVC strategy.
The same applies to pedestrian safety.


The debate is closed.

But it is normal practice.
That is something we find unacceptable.
It comes very close to doing that.
I beg to disagree.
This is common sense.
That is not our point.
Why are we doing this?
That too has already been mentioned.
We have to change this.

The debate is closed.
(Laughter and applause)
We shall therefore take a single vote.
.
(Laughter and applause)
... it is not as bad as it sounds!
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
.
.
.
.
I wish to highlight the importance:
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
They are summarised as follows:
This is an unknown virus.
Other countries are doing that.
Why are we not doing so?
Is that as it should be?
That is not enough, however.
Perhaps this is enough at this point.
That might have happened.
That could already have happened.
That could have happened to us.
What would we have done?
The problems are broader than this.
It is not just about SARS.
What should we do about these?

In any case, we must have guidelines.
Why is that?
Take heed!
What are we doing now in Europe?
In Europe we have an internal market.
I am not one of them.
Is this too little too late?
We have no knowledge of any vaccines.
I regret that.
What do I see?
What security can I offer citizens now?
What must I now actually conclude?
They are needed more than ever.
It simply passes around as it chooses.
A great many topics were touched on.
The debate is closed.
It is an absolute disgrace.
Let us not fool ourselves.
This is not just Parliament's role.
Where has this money gone?
That brings me to budgetary rigour.
We see no need for that.
This expenditure item is new.
The focus is the right one.
What is so wrong with it?
All this is absurd.
What does it involve?
Moreover, the House is half-full today.
What are we asking?
It is not very expensive.
We have no greater challenge than this.
The debate is closed.
The funds are available for this.
Thank you very much!
It may come later.
They are not being increased very much.
What relationship does it bear?
This too is an issue for Parliament.
No mention has yet been made of Iraq.
This we shall also have to discuss.
It cannot come from Berlaymont alone.
This too we shall examine critically.
Who knows?!
That concludes the item.

It is not just energy.
That is the first step.
Are they interested in such a solution?
Yes, they do have a great interest.
That concludes the item.
It will make the order more logical.
Part I
Subject: Discharges of oil in Gibraltar
ESPart II
Questions to Commissioner Nielson
I am grateful to the honourable Member.
Mr Posselt is absolutely right.
Subject: Reproductive health
This is what I find most important.
Difficult, but all right.
Have there been any developments?
Mrs Kinnock's remark is important.
This is reality.
Questions to Commissioner Schreyer
This is the global figure.
This is now an ongoing effort.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
We thank you for your cooperation.
Mr President, these are oral questions.
We still have 10 minutes left.
The first question is my question.
Three Members will take the floor.
That is how the order is decided.
Mrs Ahern has the floor.
Mrs Schreyer?
Mrs Ahern, please put your question.
Can Mrs Schreyer confirm that?
I have nothing to ask the Commissioner.
It was an internal point of order.
Why do they appear in the document?
That is why they are there.
You witnessed that just as I did.
Thank you.

This is unacceptable.
This is not the case.
Is that, I ask you, democracy?
Is that freedom of opinion?
The list could go on and on.
Sadly, that is now the case.
What conclusions can we draw from this?
That is how life is lived there.

Thank you very much, Mr Korakas.
I take the same view.
This we have always supported.
That cannot be denied.
This I find quite proper.
The Commission learns with difficulty.
The Council never learns.
This Parliament learns, but not always.
I shall cite just a few.

I commend the proposal to the House.
Thank you, Mr R√ºbig.
The debate is closed.
The first is the environmental impact.
The third link is transport policy.


Thank you, Mr Jarzembowski.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.06 p.m.)
Situation in Iraq
However, it is a complicated operation.
They are very different.
Today, we face a new situation in Iraq.



No, it is up to us to act in unison.
Now let me turn to Iraq.
(Applause)
We must seize this opportunity now.
(Applause)
Why?
This is an absolutely essential issue.
In any event, my group is ready.
It is not right and nor is it smart.
Did you hear anything in that line?
I did not.
That is not in dispute.
It is time for some straight talking.
(Applause)
I listened to the people.
The people are relishing their freedom.
It is early days.
The figure for ECHO is EUR 100 million.
What did we do doing the war?
What did we do after the war?
They are occupying forces.
It sets a very dangerous precedent.
That is clear.
This is a war crime in my eyes.
It is a disgrace!
It is a disgrace!
We owe them our solidarity.
So how do things look now?
Wars are not fought about those.
Spain has been sidelined.
The United Nations has not failed.
What are they?
This is of the utmost importance.
We are talking about war and peace.
I value the transatlantic relationship.
Mine have not changed.
Yet this is still not enough.
Where was his loyal cooperation?
A lot of inspiration is needed.
To do this an honest broker is needed.
I am not going to restart the debate.
It was a member of OPEC.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENTS (RULE 120)
.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament approved the joint text)
After the vote:
That is quite clear.
Thank you for pointing that out.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
We will now continue with the vote.
In Amendment No 99, it is.
They are the same.
President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
Lastly, I wish to highlight:
c) gender balance.
.
.
.
.
.
I do not think so.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
The third issue relates to procedure.
In our opinion this is unacceptable.
I will now outline my second question.
I firmly believe it is not.
Ask the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay.
We do not have this information.
That is what we want.
Thank you, Minister.
The debate is closed.
Thank you for listening.
This is urgent.
(The President cut off the speaker)



Doom and gloom.
That was what it boiled down to.
They are also neighbours and friends.
Their agendas really are too different.
That should be clear.

Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We do not see it that way.
Can we exert any influence?
If so, in what way?
I have a question on this point.
That is not acceptable.
That is the reality today.
We do not need any new organisations.
I specifically asked for that.
Council Directive 1999/70/EC
I am forced to remind you of this.
Question No 3 lapses.
Subject: Reforming the Dayton Agreement

That is where the emphasis should be.
I have noted the member's comment.
Subject: WTO and agriculture deadline



Subject: European Rural Model
Subject: Women in Afghanistan and Iraq
Subject: Cuba: policy review
That concludes the formal sitting.
How are we to deal with this?
What exactly were the new measures?
We went even further.
It is not a public health problem.
This is the second report.
Finally, we must not become complacent.
It was awful to see that speed.
They traumatised whole communities.
He has shown that.
When will it start?
Public tenders have gone out.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.


.
This problem is being addressed.
Sixteen would own a telephone.
Thank you very much, Mrs Junker.
The debate is closed.
.
I appreciate that very much.
It is a success for us all.
This has been a missing element.
There are also too many programmes.
I know he will be thinking that.
So what is the situation?
We have a long road ahead of us.
No!
It happens through education.
We have already seen this in Europe.
But it is a long road.
That is the key to development.
It is a question of priorities.
That is quite tough!
This is an important point.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Do you know who wrote the script?
No?
Shame on you!
That neither!
Do you know who directed it?
Perhaps someone can remember?
No, they cannot.
Hmm.
Why?
May the exercise be a success!
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
We have achieved this.
We have two proposals in this regard.
That is what coordination is about.
You cannot have your cake and eat it.
We advocate increasing labour mobility.
We appeal for social dialogue.
We just need to know how things stand.
We believe these changes are crucial.
We think the latter is the best option.
You asked two questions.
We believe we already have the plans.
We know what we need to do.
I think we share your disquiet.
Action on these is certainly needed.
This is happening at the moment.
Today, the situation is different.
We have not managed to do this.
Both have pledged this in writing.
I very much welcome this.
First of all, social policy.
The first is pension provision.
Another point: immigration.
I quote in English:
It concerns salaries.
I share this view.
I should like to mention a few points.
I have written to these Commissioners.
Sadly, one was not possible.
Monetary policy has changed, obviously.
I shall return to this point later.
This is not the case.
Nothing could be further from reality.
This is obviously a crucial point.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon.
I referred earlier to wages policies.
Who is this lady?
Nor is she a token woman.
Thank you, Mr R√ºbig.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon
We shall proceed to the vote shortly.
The next item is voting time.
The House has decided, Mr Posselt.
It is incorrect.
That is all.
That concludes voting time.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Why did I abstain, then?
Egunkaria is merely a newspaper.
That is why I abstained.
.
.
.
Nothing is said about foreign debt.
.
The rapporteur himself admits this.
.
.
That would be a mistake.
.
Is it the increasing poverty?
Not at all!
It will have to do without our support.
We voted against this report.
The report as a whole is sound.
.
Are there any comments?
Mr Posselt has the floor.
Mr Wieland has the floor.
Who is making the decisions here?
Mr Korakas has the floor.
This attack is not the first.
(The Minutes were approved)
I wish him well in Sunday's elections.
This worked well then.
Surely we wanted a dynamic Europe?
Thank you very much Mr Vermeer.
.
We need codecision.
The age pyramid is turning on its head.
That is not customer-friendly conduct.
We must learn to call a spade a spade.
Yet this is inevitable.
What would that mean?
Nothing is clear!
The debate will definitely continue.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
This must stop at all costs.
The European Union must insist on this.
Hundreds of people have been injured.
We seem to turn a blind eye to this.
I have been an MEP now for four years.
I have lived in Africa for many years.
It has to be the other way round.
We must act.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Mr President, I join in the chorus.
The debate is closed.
That is not our responsibility.
That is what this House demands.
Many thanks to all those Members.
The debate is closed.
Resumption of the session
Thank you.
Wednesday
Can we not invite him?
This is a serious matter.
I can only offer you the facts.
I will take up the matter, Mrs Maes.
Thank you for raising it.
Both matters are worth examining.





The debate is closed.
That is what the Statute is for!
That is what it is about!
(Applause)
(Laughter)
That is what this Statute is about!
(Applause)
(Applause)
.
That, though, makes no sense.
That shows how old this law is.
This issue calls for new law.
(Applause)
Surely this is the point.
This is our last chance.

So we have got this wrong.
Transparency in expenses is essential.
That is what is most important.
That is the right course to follow.
In my opinion, that is very true.
That is a considerable step forward.




This, therefore, is not acceptable.
Unfortunately, that is not the case.
They demand answers from us.
The debate is closed.
4 recommendations for second reading:

What have we achieved?
The games must stop.
I think this is a good result.
The Committee officially withdrew them.
It is like an election.
I will see to it that this is done.
Fine.
Let us focus on a couple of points.
That will be the crux of the matter.
I have just spoken to him.
The reason is obvious.
What comes next? That is the question.
We have not achieved all we want.
The risks are to research.
It is an important move forward.
Why is it to their advantage?
Some Members want to force this.
Do the gains offset the costs?
What are the gains?
And the disadvantages?
I would say, no, it does not.
I would say that it does.
It is something that we have to change.
.
I agree.
The debate is closed.
.
Let me address a couple more aspects.
We had three proposed amendments.
Those are the problems we have to face.
.
In short, see recital 5a.
This is waste management.
If only they were, Commissioner.
What is a dirty vessel?
I have two further remarks.
.
That is now crystal clear.
That is a good result.
.
The debate is closed.
.
Are we entirely in agreement then?
Not quite.
Let me add a few observations.
We approve.
.
Experience has shown this.
This is a fascinating debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
That explains the current situation.
Reform is sought in this area.
The 2001 report is an interesting one.
Once again I thank the rapporteur.
What is going on?
Possibly!
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
.


.


The report was presented in March 2003.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
.
What are the main elements of reform?
Firstly, stability.
I now turn to the new priorities.
This proposal has been taken on board.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
We fully agree with this strategy.
We have abandoned the pillar structure.
A third important issue is integration.
That is important.
The fact is, it is not.

I hope the group will pull back.
It is simply not worth it.
There was a need for this.
Social cohesion was to increase.
The debate is closed.
.
A precedent is being set.
Habeas corpus really is a basic right.
It is enshrined in all the conventions.
No adequate explanation has been given.
It has not been an easy task.
Nobody would dispute that.
Who is extradited?
Is this a milestone, then?
Not yet.
Definitely not.
Can we sink any deeper?
I would like to ask two questions.
Why?
.
I shall begin with Article 13.
I shall try to make myself clear.
Therein lies the problem.
It does not exist.
The debate is closed.
.
Students enjoy ever-greater mobility.
I am not opposed to the idea.
That is probably even more important.
Sadly, we are far from achieving this.
.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
(Mixed reaction)
I welcome this.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
This is noted also in the voting list.
(Applause)
The services are aware of the problem.
Before the vote on Amendment No 10:
Before the vote on Amendment No 23:
I shall therefore vote against it.
We now have a majority.
.
Of course, we did not support it.
.
.
.
The democrats will appreciate this?
.
I put the question to the House.
.
.
We do not share this view.
.
.
.
.
The fight against poverty is key.
It is a matter of solidarity.
.
.
I think that Parliament?
(The President cut off the speaker)
.
Article 27.
.
.
.
This is a vision that we do not share.
Hence our vote against the report.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
What is the point of these words?
Hence my vote against the report.
.
.
I therefore voted against the report.
.
.
.
.
(PT) I voted for this excellent report.
.
.


.
.
.
.
We insist upon food safety and quality.
We demand worker protection.
Prevention is better than cure.
So why shouldn't we do the same?
This is unfair.
I refer to private storage.
The latter will not work.
In June I applauded and supported it.
That is not true.
That is not fair, Commissioner.
Second issue: modulation.
The third issue is cross-compliance.
.
This model is our programme.
.
That is something with which we agree.
Perhaps I will be in luck today.
(Restrained applause)
We should all be clear about this.
Decoupling is also a complicated area.





They are very vague.


That way, he is overshooting the goal.
Should we repeat this mistake?
Why?

Let us have total decoupling.
I have a question for the Council.
I hope he can confirm what he said.
That will not work.
It is not fair.
We must look into that.
First of all, there is set-aside.
We are worried.
(Applause)
.
Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Part I
.
Part 2
Question addressed to Mr Monti
.
.
.
Subject: Parallel trade
.
.
Questions to Mrs Reding
Subject: Minority languages
.
.
.
That is one point.
Subject: Violence at football grounds
.
The honourable Member is right.
Sport is therefore added.
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.

.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Ebner is right.
That is fine by me.
.
Has France banned rugby?
That is news to me.
Questions to Mrs Diamantopoulou
There is legal chaos in Greece.
Subject: EU senior citizens' card
They are consumers.
It is a nice idea.
It has not changed.
Subject: Youth unemployment
This is the 5 + 2 rule.
.
I am not at all ready to say adieu.
Young immigrants are always an asset.
Is this feasible?
.
.
.
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
.
(SV) Thank you, Mr President.
.
.
This regulation is a great success.
I think that is absolutely crucial.
The debate is closed.
.
The aim is to reduce emissions.
That is how we must work together.
.
Shipping is a global industry.
Thank you Mrs Wallstr√∂m.
The debate is closed.
I disagree.
Let us be quite clear about this.
That is why it is a conservation zone.
We cannot allow this to happen.
Another key aspect is job losses.
.
.
There is a reason for this.
These are tough times, of course.
There is a lot of hypocrisy here.
It is not a political one.
I concur with the people of Ireland.
We must ask why.
After that, God only knows.
We support Mr Hudghton's report.
This must be made absolutely clear.
This is not about discrimination.
Far from it.
Help is urgently needed.
An excellent message indeed.
We are not in a transitional period!
This is completely unacceptable.
Are these not our waters in that sense?
There is no equity in that.
.
I will start with the Hudghton report.
Thank you for pointing this out.
There is no going back.
.
Thank you Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
.
Breast cancer
Breast cancer affects all of us.
A number of figures were quoted.
What does it contain?
There are great differences in Europe.
The same goes for prostate cancer.
Same problem.
I think that that is very important.
This view I share entirely.
That is by no means a luxury.
We really must learn from that.
Why is this so?
That must make us think.
There are discussions about this.
firstly, prevention and screening.
secondly: diagnosis.
thirdly: treatment and follow-up.

The debate is closed.
First, it is based on scientific data.
Let me also thank Mr Schnellhardt.
That is a clear and good principle.
Scandals crop up again and again.
If something is wrong, they report it.
Who should be responsible for it?
Where does subsidiarity fit in?

I agree with almost everything he says.
We need food safety.
Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Thank you, Mrs Malliori.
.
Thank you, Commissioner.
(Applause)
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
After the vote:
(The President cut off the speaker)
We have yet to see this document.
I can explain this very quickly.
There is no new Commission proposal.
That seems perfectly reasonable.
Our amendments say they are compatible.

This was a question of convenience.
He was applying the Rules.

What do we have now?
.

.

.

.
.
.
It is costly and at times unfair.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
(FR) I abstained.
.
.
Arrests, torture and murder continue.
DEHAP is about to be banned.
.
Turkey is heir to a great civilisation.
.
.
.
.
I actually think this is unfair.
.
Sport in schools is clearly in decline.
.
.
.
Hence our vote in favour of the report.
.
.
There is a lot of work to be done.
We have noted the point you have made.
The clarification is simple.
The Minutes have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Thank you.
.
This communication serves two purposes.
That has already been mentioned too.
The debate is closed.
Aceh was a great seafaring nation.
Aceh never wanted to belong.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Opponents are being silenced.
It is of crucial importance.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Let us keep things in perspective.
How does Europe handle this pressure?
Is that the right method?
This will not help us at all.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Before the vote)
Mr van den Bos has the floor.
We would then vote in favour of them.
That was the last item on the agenda.
(The sitting was closed at 4.40 p.m.)
.
.
Resumption of the session
I am happy to do that.
The Convention has given its lead.
I believe the citizen has won.
That is without parallel in history.
What is new about it?
(Applause)
We have more scope for action.
(Applause)
There is still work to be done.
This brings me to my final point.
I fully endorse this.
That, however, was not the case.
I am not sure this has happened.
Work has begun on the Constitution.
We must take care to avoid this.
That concludes the debate.
WRITTEN STATEMENTS (RULE 120)
On the contrary, it diminishes them.
The Roadmap must be applied.
The operation is not easy.
.
Further progress is needed.
We can point to some progress.
This is not a new point for us.
Firstly, our relations with Iran.
Their Roadmap is one to hell.
Egypt too has played an active role.
It is already long overdue.


Your state, for pity's sake!
A day, a week, a month?
Two Palestinian states?
We must not encourage it.
At last!
Focard's heirs!
I repeat: Focard's heirs!
I wish you luck, Mr President.
I wish you luck, fellow Members.
We need it.
It also includes Prime Minister Sharon.
Mr President, it was 4 June in Aqaba.
Remarkable things were said.
It has the political resources to act.
The peace process is still fragile.
You mentioned the protocol.
That opportunity must not be wasted.
I think that we are playing with fire.
To finish, I have two questions.
It is futile to answer this question.
That needs to be recognised.
.
Thank you very much, Mr Solana.
The debate is closed.
.

.
I could go on - but the point is clear.
I think the point is clear.
In my view, this is the wrong approach.
What plans exist for doing so?
No, no one takes us seriously!
Are we credible?
No.
We therefore were not credible.
We are not credible.
Let us take another example.
No.
No.
I will end with a comment on terrorism.
Good accounts make good friends.
We are in a new era.
.

The first answer is development.
I see that as one of the core issues.
There is a word for it: dynamism.
Yes, we can do it at bilateral level.
We have tried, we Europeans.
We will have to come back to it later.
A lot of governments play that game.
These are the answers I wanted to give.
Yes, globalisation has its effects.
That used to be true at national level.
The debate is closed.
They are difficult for us to accept.
.
They are a factor for integration.
.
Tomorrow, we can vote in favour.
I hope that we will.
.
Why has this been a never-ending story?
That is why we welcome it.
No doubt this can easily be corrected.
I am, myself, in favour of them.
The proposal has totalitarian features.
We have no uniform right to vote.
We owe him our thanks.
For what is a European party?
It is almost faultless.
This brings me back to my envelopes.
It is not clear why.
Perhaps you know that, Mr Karas.
Is that democracy?
Do you know them?
I wonder who will give the money?
Thank you very much, Mr Dell'Alba.
In my view, it is the other way around.
That would lose us our credibility.
.
The debate is closed.

.
I fully share these positions.
Energy has a role in education.
Financial support is therefore needed.
The need for finance is evident.
True, we have proposed privatisation.
These are two quite different issues.
Money may be private or public.
Thank you for the debate.
The debate is closed.
.
In our opinion this is not the case.

Everywhere else we have responded.
That is a reasonable remark.
Please act on them.
The debate is closed.
.
This sends out a very bad signal.
There are many predators.
.
The debate is closed.
Additives in animal nutrition
.
.
This case is no different.
Is it in the interests of the farmer?
This is certainly necessary.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
.
Their experience is vital.
Quite right.
That will cure you for sure!
That much is indisputable.
Is this claim true or false?
It certainly constitutes a challenge.
Who is right?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
We shall now adjourn until voting time.
The next item is the vote.

Before the vote:

(Applause)
So please, support this today.
I shall read out this amendment:
.
.
I therefore voted in favour.
.

.
(PT) I voted in favour of this report.
.
.
.
(PT) I find myself forced to abstain.
.
We must not frighten people.
.
.
We therefore voted against the motion.
.
.
.
.
I therefore voted against the report.
I do not add my voice to this majority.
.
Why?
.
.
.
The rules and directives are in place.
.
.

Resumption of the session
Openness.
Piet Dankert, monsieur le Pr√©sident.
Perseverance.
Democracy.
Vision.
Enjoyment.
Relations.
I will be quicker next time!
They wanted to work in Europe.
That is a long time.
Such was the prevailing opinion.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
But that is a separate issue.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
rapporteur.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
This should put some fears to rest.
.
What is today's debate about?
What do we mean by a prospectus?
What does the directive aim at?
That is what we need.
These two questions remain pressing.
I also fought hard against this.
I believe that is a great success.
That is a victory for Parliament.
I believe this is a very good thing.
This will become a selling point.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be on Wednesday.
and
.
.
With this I believe we can all agree.
That was a real advance.
Then we have the common position.
Let us be brave!
Let us go forward, colleagues!
Why are they not included?
I agree with you on that.
These lists are arbitrary.
Water is a public good.
That is a frightening prospect.
State money attracts them.
Returns are all that counts.
No!
Who would not be?
You forget other aims, however.
That seems incredible to me.
Very well, then.
We want to create innovation.
This is only the lower level.
That is the only thing we need.
Philips and Daf were in dire straits.
But we could have gone further.
.
There is no doubt about that.

The programme of the Italian Presidency

(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
This calls for vision and conviction.
(Applause from the right)
What a great moment in history!
(Applause from the right)
(Laughter and heckling)
We do not want that to happen.
(Applause from the right)
Today you have taken the Ciampi line.
(Applause from the left)
(Applause from the left)
Now there is something else, however.
The Convention has taken place.
The doors cannot be closed.
(Applause from the left)
(Applause)
I hope this is not a presage.
These two policy areas are linked.
(Applause from the left)
(Applause from the left)
(Applause from the right)
This is quite clear.
This is Christian Europe!
We Radicals applauded!
We applauded at the G8!
That is not all.
(Applause)

Do not disappoint it.

We ought to talk about him as well!
Why should that be?
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Heckling)

I have had nothing.
That is what concerns me.
That will not happen in this House.
I wish you success in your work!
Italy is a great European country.
You, Italy, are a clear example.
We do not need it.
I wish the President success.
Thank you very much!
A last thought concerns world poverty.
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
You would be perfect!
(Laughter, protests from the left)
(Applause from the right)
Why?
(Uproar on the left)
You have made a proposal.
(Applause)
(Mixed reactions)
I said what I said ironically.
We are running very late.
I will not take those points.
It is unfortunate.
It is regrettable.
(Sustained applause)
In what fields?
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
In short, it wants to liberalise.
That is why we voted against it.
I reject this approach.
.
This too must be counteracted.
.
We need this labelling.
.
.
.
.
.
.
This last point is essential.
.
.
.
.
I respect their work.
.
.
We regard it as a good instrument.
.
(FR) I voted in favour of this text.
.
That concludes voting time.
.
.
There must be no doubt about this.
That is what happened the first time.
Human rights must be protected.
This will require a long-term presence.
Outsiders cannot advise or guide them.
But that is by no means enough.
The situation is far more complex.
What sort of political process is this?
So this is the normalisation process!
That is what it is really about.
Chechnya is an international issue.
We need effective election monitoring.
The debate is closed.
In agriculture, we have done our duty.
I am personally delighted about that.
Now for my third point.
So far, no progress has been made.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
.
Our initiative will take various forms.
The Union regrets this measure.
What does this position mean?
So how can we put forward our position?
What are the results?
The results are rather mixed.
No one will be surprised at this.
That is extremely perverse.
Everybody must be equal before the law.
.
I thank the Mr President-in-Office.
His reply is very positive.
.
.
.
.
Subject: Illegal occupation of Iraq
.
Firstly, in relation to the resolution.
.
.
Subject: Human rights in Russia
.
It is making progress again.
Subject: Hallmarking of precious metals
.
.
.
.
Subject: Ban on cloning
.
.
.
.
.
.


.
Today, however, we have an occupation.
So there were other reasons.
What will the Italian Presidency do?
.
.
.
.
The next item is the joint debate on

.




So how do matters stand?
Why is this so?
How are these to become reality?
A problem, too, is charges.
I will come back to this.
Is this good or bad?
I think that it is a process.
The concerns and doubts prevailed.



That is what it is about.
.




That is not our job.
We are not liberalising anything here.
That is another issue.
The debate is closed.
.
This is a false distinction.
(Applause)
Noise, too, constitutes a nuisance.
That will not help matters at all.
That is simply false.
Never could you justify such a thing!
It is just not on!
(Vigorous applause)
.
It represents an Austrian exception.
I just wanted to clarify that.
That is all.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at 12 noon tomorrow.
.
That is no longer acceptable, however.
But that is a semantic aside.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 12 noon tomorrow.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
.


That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 12 noon tomorrow.
.

, rapporteur.
That is not my last word on the matter.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at 12 noon tomorrow.
(The sitting closed at midnight)
We have tried to seek a compromise.
.
Thank you Mr Staes.
ECB 2002 annual report
Many thanks, Mr President.
The last quarter saw zero growth.
.
.
Monetary growth was strong in 2002.
We could do something to change that.
After all, there is a 1-dollar note!
(Applause)
That needs to be emphasised too.
Many thanks for your work.
She is mistaken.
In fact, the reverse is true.
I think that is a mistake too.
That is pure nonsense!
.
That is our aim.
I do not believe so.
Let me answer another question clearly.
The answer is that we do not see that.
Deflation is not around the corner.
That is clear.
Is the definition too rigid?
Let me speak anecdotally.
Their answer was: 'Why?
What's so special about the euro?
We don't know anything else!
What was there to explain?'
It is simply their money.
(Applause)
We are deeply grateful to you.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at 12 noon.
.
The euro area is growing.
Thank you, Mr F√§rm.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
(Applause)

.
I shall give two examples.
A second example is as follows.
It does not give them their due.
They will be forced to be the same.
Where have I heard those words before?
That is why we need a budget analysis.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mrs Gr√∂ner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
That is right.
We will see what we can do.
The next item is the vote.
Joint motion for a resolution
Amendment No 16 deletes Article 18(2).
Before the vote on Amendment No 31:
Amendment No 31 deletes Article 10.
Before the vote:
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote:
.

.
.
That is a democratic requirement.
.
I was persuaded to vote in its favour.
.
The reality is very different.
.
We need generational budgeting.
Which generations pay the taxes?
Is it the rich or the poor?
This is a question about justice.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Food additives are already regulated.
.
.
.
.
That is what I hope will happen.
.
.
.
.
This would give the WTO further powers.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This report is thus very timely.
Families there live by farm tourism.
This is all done in dribs and drabs.
(Applause from the centre and left)
Society owes them a debt of gratitude.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
.
Nor are there enough controls.
The legislation exists.
.
The decision says no more than that.
.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
There must be total freedom there.
My group has concerns on both counts.
We too have come a long way.
Violence is still taking place today.
.
The joint debate is closed.
They did not get a fair trial.
They do not have visitation rights.
There should be freedom of the press.
It must stop.
They are simply Laotians.
This is crucial.
.
The joint debate is closed.
His story was shocking.
Much needs to be done.
No!
It is, therefore, being punished.
.

The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place next.
That is why we want to add to it.
It is as follows:
Qa. ...
.
.
Thank you very much for you comment.
I have taken good note of it.
(The sitting was closed at 5.35 p.m.)
Statement by the President
The following change has been proposed:
(Laughter and applause)
To my point now.
I will respond to that.
Now we have Najaf.
I would be happy to do that.
This Fund was set up in three months.
They are right to do so.
Nobody is now left unaware of that.
Let me say bluntly that no, we are not.
We funked it.
We did not manage to do that.
They did not manage to do that.
It is true that Europe must do more.
What are we requesting?
It is madness!
We are world leaders in wood heating.
This gives us food for thought.
I doubt it, however.
It is a national disaster.
These figures are terrifying.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Where is this Timisoara taking place?
Under Milosevic?
In Baghdad, under Saddam Hussein?
In Haider's Austria?
It is in France.
Where did all these deaths occur?
They were not given enough to drink.
They died of dehydration.
Why is that?
Why?
Most of those who died were women.
What, then, is to be done?
Let us keep this in mind.
I began in this Parliament in 1986.
Why?
We must take action at Community level.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is still not the case, as we know.
Let us, then, learn the lessons.
That is preaching to the converted.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Switzerland was mentioned.
The money is, therefore, there.
It is not the money that is lacking.
Chance has nothing to do with it.
Mrs Ries mentioned education.
That is fine by me.
That concludes the item.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
(Sustained applause)
.
Venture capital is risk capital.
The fifth area demands something of us.
Mr President.
The EU average is only 46%.
The consequences would be disastrous.
Mr President.
Basel II still needs to be discussed.
.
The debate is closed.
.
That is absolutely vital.
.
I will be brief.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 9.10 p.m.)
Cohesion policy
and
, Rapporteur.
Thus it:
This triad is important.
Thank you, Mr Duin.
That is inevitable.
We understand one another better now.
We want to avoid this.
I represent Aragon in Spain.
Furthermore, such ageing is inevitable.
Today is no different.
In essence, this is a good idea.
There are handicaps that are ongoing.
There must be a regional policy.
We must also have territorial cohesion.
We must be able to live in these areas.
We must keep on the right track.
I would like to comment on three areas.
Enlargement is only eight months away.
Well then, what can we do?
How?
How could this happen?
.
Solidarity is one of these.
Nobody wants that to happen.
This is indeed significant.
It is all quite straightforward.
The same should apply to territories.
I trust this will be the case.
We do not have any hidden agenda.
Cohesion policy ought to be symbolic.
There are also objective reasons.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon today.
The idea is very simple.
(Sustained applause)
That is an important task.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon today.
.
We trust the Commission.
The amendment is superfluous!
That is also an important breakthrough.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon today.
.
The text is concerned with two points.
We have taken note of this guideline.
We have taken note of this argument.
We can take note of this suggestion.
That is why this is very important.
Can this spell anything but disaster?
This is no longer a coincidence.
The debate on this report is suspended.
It will continue at 3 p.m.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
.
That is a significant step forward.
I commend it to the House.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
After the vote:
.
.
.
Prevention is better than compensation.
.
.
Why not?
.
.
.
.
We voted against this report.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
strengthen inter-regional cooperation;
.
.
.
.
.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you, Mrs Scallon
The debate is closed
It is parity of treatment.
That is absolutely essential.
I am now going to list its blessings.
Cross-border workers.
Unemployment.
I do have sympathy for Amendment No 49.
This has not been a success to date.
This receives my support.
We also have a catalogue of problems.
I would like to see an end put to this.
Few feel up to the task.
Why?
That is the first reason.


This is an outrage.
Why is this so?
I agree with that point.
I think that is very important.
Would that be possible?
That would be the ideal.
Have we been asked about them?
We are in a good frame of mind!

We should review the whole situation.
The truth is something different.
Greenland withdrew from the Union.
That is too generous.
The debate is closed.
Commissioner Lamy has the floor.
I have a second question.
The second point is workers' rights.
We will carry on down this road.
Thank you Commissioner Lamy.
Are they in a position to do so?
Can you reassure us in this respect?
Mr Cunha is right.
It is a simple one.
Take the example of sugar.
Decisions are not taken for them.
This is what compromise is all about.
Thank you Commissioner Lamy.
.
.
Subject: Operation Ulysses
.

.

.
.
.
So we can only estimate it.
.
.
.
.
What does this mean?
(The President cut off the speaker)
.
I do not see a problem in that.
The reform stands.
It is you who must decide!
A one-word answer will suffice.
.
.
.
.
No, I cannot do that.
I have done what I could.
.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
.
Absolutely.
We have to keep trying.
.
.
.
This is where we are at the moment.
We have to be careful about that.
Thank you very much Commissioner.
.
.
That is where we are.
.
I thank the Commissioner.
.
.
We have to work in collaboration.
.
.
We will continue to do so.
I cannot answer your question today.
Subject: NATURA 2000 site designation
.
.
.
We must be inclusive.
That includes institutionalisation.
Are we going to exclude them?
This is a world-wide convention.
This is a truly worldwide issue.
These prove her wrong.
We stand by the split vote.
This is extremely important.
This will be a great opportunity.
Transposition is currently incomplete.
The two are not contradictory.
These areas are detailed in the report.
It is not a question of charity.
It is a question of rights.
But this is only half the story.
I regret this too.
We need a convention to do that.
Much, however, remains to be done.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
.
Let me now turn to the amendments.
Firstly, duration.
I will give you three examples.
This is clearly discrimination.
This is not an acceptable situation.
Thank you, Mrs McKenna.
The debate is closed.
.
That is something we must combat.
This is an important period, however.
Today, we are talking about children.
Why is this an achievement?
We do indeed lack a legal basis.
This taboo must be broken.
DAPHNE I was a runaway success.
Thank you, Mr President.
Which were successful?
I understand.
.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The final point is the euro.
Thank you, Mr President.
A legal basis is urgently needed.
The debate is closed.
EU-Cuba relations
I think this has to be made very clear.
.
.
The Cuban people are suffering.
Castro has provoked the EU.
Aid needs to be transparent.


This is, therefore, an open proposal.
(Laughter and applause)
Three solutions are then possible.
This could have serious consequences.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
.

A great deal has been achieved.
.
(Applause)
.
(Applause)
This is definitely one of those times.
(Applause)
Why?
We have modified it profoundly.
Our work has ended.
[The guardian of the Constitution.
The Convention did precisely that.
That is something we have to prevent.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
That responsibility is ours.
(Applause)
You are very welcome here.
That is what I have to ask of you.
(Applause)
Obviously, the name has changed.
Democracy means choice.
Is that not a legitimate question?
I await your reply.
In this you will have our full support.
Now, where is the constituent power?
That is an outrageous claim.
What referendum, however?
At European level as a whole?
At national level?
That is a pity.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
That is a crucial point.
This point has not been raised.
I would cite the case of taxation.
We debated with them.
I now turn to MEPs' speeches.
I shall turn to you, Mr H√§nsch, last.
It is the fruit of a joint effort.
There is no intergovernmental element.
Where, however, are the constituents?
It was composed of named people.
The constituent is whoever ratifies.
My last reply is to Mr H√§nsch.
(Loud applause)
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATIONS (RULE 120)
The result does not surprise us.

.

(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE

We ought to learn from it.
.
We also need to look to the future.
.
Why is that?

.
.
A number of tributes were paid to him.
Maybe I am wrong.
But I do not think that it would be.
(Interjection from Mr Cohn-Bendit)
(Sustained applause)

Our message was: probably as both.
More is required.
The UN must become involved.
Where is that going to get us?
I wish you luck, Commissioner.
This is an extremely sad situation.
We know what that does.
It is the same with Iraq.
That is why Europe's hour has come.
We must provide help.
Look at the century we have just left.
What is all conflict about?
.
I feel this is a necessary experiment.

The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATIONS (RULE 120)
.
The objectionable caste system.
Children.
.
.
This is a good, relevant reference.
However, the system is interesting.
I agree with Mr van den Bos.
Finally, I would make two remarks.
There is nothing but the conflict.
This is an urgent matter.
It could be done.
Maybe then we would have some progress.
.
.
We have to remain multilateralist.
We do not have one.
We are trying to create one.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATIONS (RULE 120)
This must be resisted.
Why should it be a lesson for us?
The final problem is equality.
Too much progress is still required.
.
Let us first look at the facts.
There is a slight problem though.
I refuse to believe that.
I wish to comment on three areas.
The second area is prison conditions.
We cannot have this situation.
I think not.
Our good name is at stake here.
(Applause from the right)
I could reply in the same tone.
I am not going to do so.
Hurrah for the rapporteur!
We will gladly vote for the report.
.

.
Subject: Operation Ulysses
.
.
That is a very good point.
.
.
.
Thank you Minister.
Subject: Competitiveness in the EU
.
.
What do you think of this idea?
Subject: Detainees in Iraq
and
I therefore urge you to support it.
.
There is no such pressure.
That is the approach.
What does 'commercial' mean?
It is too long-term and too expensive.
There are no quick profits.
We are nowhere near achieving that.
We know what to do there.
Please be realistic.
That is the real battle.
I am still somewhat optimistic.
It has to succeed.
We are taking the safe route.
I have cut across the themes.
I cannot do that here.
This is with good reason.
That goes without saying.
I hope they will not be disappointed.
We give two dollars a day to a cow.
In Canc√∫n we can make a difference.
What are our lives about?
UN figures prove it.
Proper globalisation is the way ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
No.
It was easier to earn money that way.
A European fund is vital.
Economic diversification is crucial.
It is a resource which must be shared.
The Commissioner has explained this.
There is only one answer: water.
Not democracy.
Not human rights.
Not medicines.
Nothing else, just water.
What a fantastic job.
This is what these people need.
Sadly, it is not enough.
Parliament needs to be involved.
I want this to happen.
That is the key to trade.
I hope he will do more.
.
This is not difficult to understand.
It is more like a facility.
This is a totally political judgement.
That is what we are trying to do.
There is no easy answer to that.
The joint debate is closed.
.
In return, we send them just 1 300.
This is unacceptable.
That is simply inadequate.
That will not achieve results.
.
That, not least, must be avoided!
Women, too, are especially at risk.
Major vaccination campaigns are needed.
They have a pain threshold.
In this our positions do not differ.
The debate is closed.
.

We must, we should and we will.
.
I am quite optimistic.
It does not.
This is well understood.
This should be given more attention.
I want to say one last thing.
He has my full support.
Who are these non-state actors though?
Who are these privileged partners?
Are they partners imposed on us?
.
.
This works well and happens regularly.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Announcement by the President
You should have received a copy.
Would the President like one?
President Roca, your copy awaits!
.
I wish Mr Ebner well with his report.
It is part of our very identity.
It was a sound initiative.
Language is an important key in this.
Why?
We therefore know what has to be done.
I give you my word.
Let us try it at least!

Mr Wyn is from my group.
We would have had it translated for us.
So congratulations on this good report.
The debate is closed.
.
Today that figure is 2000.
The dialogue has started.
It may be public.

I do have some remarks.

We know what it is not.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.


We are in a constituent phase.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
.
The internal market is growing.
They have to do with creation.
We need to look beyond it.
Thank you.


Thank you, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Thank you, Mr Turmes.
We take note of your statement.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
The Spanish version will be corrected.
We shall now proceed to the vote on:
That is very kind of you.
I will read it to you in English.
.
If not, we shall proceed to the vote.
(Mixed reactions)
(Applause from the right)
You did not do that Mr President.
(Applause from the right)
.
(Parliament approved the resolution)
Mr Turco is requesting the floor.
Is it on the same issue?
I will vote against this compromise.
In any event it has to be approved.
My concern is with torture.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(Parliament approved the resolution)
President.
Are there any objections?
The rapporteur is requesting the floor.

I have voted against.
And why?
I object to this behaviour.
.
.
.
.
.
The regime will not let him.
It is our duty not to abandon him.
.
It was a violation of our rights.
.
.
.
.
.
I hope that they will never do it.

.
.
.
.
.
We also have the financial means.
.
.
I voted in favour.
.
.
It also, however, has negative aspects.
.
.
That says it in a nutshell.
I would like to touch on those.
This is not a new issue.
We recognise there are difficulties.
Thank you, Mr President.
What freedom?
That, I will leave you to imagine.
There are precedents.
In Israel the situation is tragic.
That would be the answer.
There is a wonderful climate.
.
That is absolutely correct.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
.
.
That is the source of the complication.
The debate is closed.
.
This is an internal EU discussion.
We have, as you say, a single market.
I support the need for reform.
.
The debate is closed.
The joint debate is closed.
.
This, unfortunately, is not the case.
The joint debate is closed.
The regime denies that.
No one has seen her since.
Political pressure should increase.
In the case of Burma, not very much.
He has set the problem out very well.
The joint debate is closed.
The next item is the vote.
.
.
in writing.
Resumption of the session
She was one of the very best.
She will be greatly missed.
(Loud applause)
Tuesday:

This is a highly contentious issue.
Mr Cashman, I want to be clear on this.
The first petition came to us in 1997.
We need to vote on this.
(Parliament rejected the request)
So the report is then on the agenda.
The last issue appeared in May 2003.
Thank you, Mr Van Orden.
Mr President, I will be very brief.
It is our job to set an example.
We are tired of it!
We will see what we can do.
You are unanimous in that.
We will need to look at the detail.
That concludes the item.
We must make use of existing expertise.
Preparations are continuing.
The argument is about its mandate.
.
I feel that the outcome is important.
The security of fishing depends on it.
There is a problem with port controls.
What will we have to say that is new?
These measures must not be forgotten.

Unfortunately, it is not a new cry.
Was it the lack of places of refuge?
No, of course not.
What was the problem with this tragedy?
We will talk about that later.
That is what the minister says.
Now we have new arguments.
Nunca m√°is!
[Never again!]
What is position of the Member States'?
How reliable are double-hulled ships?
[Never again!]
That was the context of the report.
That is of no concern, however.
It is important.
I shall return to this in a moment.
Prevention is paramount.
What we need is a task force.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I am happy to comply.
This is the information I have.
.
Let us be frank.
The third issue is recovering oil.
Fourthly, cleaning ships.
There are two reasons for this.
The debate is closed.
.

The market is not always right.
That is something I think worth noting.
Let me now turn to security of supply.
It will not!
The question does not even arise.
I think this is an unnecessary measure.
So I urge you to pause and think again.
That should give us pause for thought.
That will be the real problem.
.
That is not what we are talking about.
That is what I am advocating.
And that is what we are talking about.
The debate is closed.
Why?
That was also stated in Thessaloniki.
.
That is what we all want.
The debate is closed.
.
That is unacceptable.
This can lead to people being deported.

The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10 p.m.)
Appointment of the ECB President
.
Is this what we want?
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
For the rest, I enjoyed his expertise.
The debate is closed.
.
That is not the case.
We do not want that.
The proposal rejects that.
Well done!
This is what we want to hear.
So what do we want?
We should be aware of this.
This directive achieves these goals.
That is regrettable.
I think that would be a bad thing.
Why?
I think that would be a bad thing.
Now a few words about interoperability.
Why are they doing almost the opposite?
Let us, therefore, stick with that.
We are not in fact without rights now.
I very much want to invite reflection.
We all know the reality of the market.
Why?
Not at all.
This is the danger.
We must try to do the best we can here.
Say no to software patenting!
It is also the heart of the directive.
That is very important to us.
That would be a real disaster.
I have some sympathy for that.
This is inherent in the patent system.
We are sorely aware of this.
I hope that trend will continue.
We therefore insist on this point.
That would be excessive.
We need this directive.
Copyright is more suitable.
.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
My main arguments are as follows:
I am in favour of open interfaces.
This should also be possible in Europe.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
Before the vote:
My committee accepted that proposal.
This situation cannot continue.
(Parliament adopted the text)
(Parliament adopted the text)
President.
.
.
.
(Laughter)
(Parliament agreed to the proposal)
Before the vote:
(Parliament agreed to the proposal)
Before the vote:
We now continue with the vote.
Before the vote on Amendment No 11:
(The President cut off the speaker)
It is therefore not accepted.
Before the vote on Amendment No 3:
, rapporteur.
.
Let us show some moderation!
.
The real reason is quite different.
.
.
This is refoulement by another name.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
This is what matters to Scotland.
.
.
There were more than 300 of them.
.
Both face inevitable decline.
.
Recent studies confirm this.
There would have been a real problem!'
As a result, I voted for the motion.
.
.
.
.
So why do we need to build up stocks?
We do not worship at that altar.
.
.
That, however, is not the case.
That is why we abstained from the vote.
A dream, Mr President.
.
.
.
.
(PT) I voted in favour of this report.
.
.
frequent surveys of high-risk ships,
.
.
.
They were:
.
.
.
.
It must even become a priority.
.
I have a genuine procedural motion.
.
All those issues need to be resolved.
I will touch on that shortly.
.
Now the budget in general.
What do we do about Iraq?
.
We need to have a balance here.
.
It is a good procedure.
Thank you for your attention.
It is going to be a turbulent year.
Who knows?
We will not get involved in this game.
There must be equality.
We will monitor this very carefully.
We have had to restructure.
460 billion!
We want to work preventively.
It will also have an impact on us.
The second is dependability.
The Commission should have.
Thank you very much.
I mention this for your information.
How can you use them in a positive way?
What happens when you discover this?
There are more examples like this.
That is throwing money away.
How does the Commission explain that?
.
.
My committee finds this unacceptable.
.
Why has that been cut?
We want an explanation about Chernobyl.
.

We hope this proposal will be approved.
This is unacceptable.
How do you intend solving this problem?



One is permitted to have doubts.
.
We appreciate that very much.
How can this be justified?
Lastly I turn to CAP reform.
.
I take a favourable view of this.
Thank you for your attention.
We have had this discussion before.
I strongly support this trend.
.
(Applause)
Finally, I turn to Eurostat.
.
That is fundamental.
I only give praise where it is due ...
.
I am impatient for further change.
I want to see total implementation.
I do not ask for that for one second.
.
I rise to do two things.
I would certainly not repeat that.
We need people!
Do not take it personally Commissioner.
It was just a general remark.
the 2000-2006 programmes,
Cohesion policy is also a top priority.
That is an increase of around 20%.
That is a matter for reflection.
I myself do not expect this at all.
What can we see happening?
I think we should put a stop to this.
Thank you.
.
What have we done?
We want a further reduction to 46%.
Thank you, Madam President.

.
.
On the whole, it has gone quite well.
Thank you, Mr Wynn.
The debate is closed.
That was a perfectly normal decision.
End of quotation.
All discrimination is banned.
Such arrogance is no longer tolerable.
I shall mention three of these.
Ought we to have blind faith in you?
The answer is 'no'.
You have won then, but at what price?
You are not a lawyer, Mr Monti.
That is the reality.
We need to support Alstom.
We are not doing that.
.
This is the task of state aid control.
Thank you Mr Cashman.
The debate is closed.
The sitting is suspended until 9 p.m.
.
Romanian society has grown up.
We thank you for your presence.
.
Here also, I fully agree with you.
I will deal with those last.
The converse also applies.

Does it give value for money?
We must go further, however.
This is as it should be.
.
The debate is closed.
We have a number of viewpoints.
There are many reasons for this.
We agreed on three lines of approach.
.
I am stating the facts as they are.
The report is not a disaster.
It is a first step.
Milan meets Malm√∂, if you like.
This is dangerous.
It is, after all, the reality.
Clearly there is a need for both.
Nevertheless we expect it will arrive.
There is a need to address that issue.
The debate is closed.
.
In practice it is sorely needed.
.
Thus far about the amendments.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
.
the reason why the data is collated;
.
The second date is 15 March 2003.
That is certainly going too far.
What are our specific problems?
The debate is closed.
.
.
Supply and demand must be maintained.
Thank you, Mr President.
That would just be more expensive.
Later she accepted it.
Were these two philosophies compatible?

I think that this is excessive.
Transparency is therefore essential.
Why do we even need a directive?
Firstly, investor protection.
.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.05 am.)
European Constitution and IGC
We are not abandoning those goals.
Perhaps that is a contradiction?
I wish it luck in times of storm.
It has fulfilled its contract.
This could be a first.
I hope they will be retained.
Let me make one final observation.
That cannot be the case.
What do we see there?
Another blow against Schuman.
What does this amount to?
That is not enough.
.
.
.
It is quite simply splendid.
There are dangers lurking.
Both proposals are the wrong ones.
One of these is the reform process.
That is impossible.

The Convention was a success.


It is the issue of federalism.
I am not very confident about all this.
Is God not above the law?
I also have 10% I would like to change.
I shall now test it out.
The third issue is that of God.
I wish you good luck.
Mr Barnier, it is for you to act now.
The lesson of Iraq must be learnt.
Will the small Member States lose out?
What about the right of appeal?
There is, of course, criticism.
Mr President, I will be very brief.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
He referred to the substance.
There is no further debate today.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The rest would stay the same.
I would ask twelve Members to rise.
Quite the opposite is the case!
.
.
Of course I have voted against it.
.
I voted against the directive.
.
.
.
That is why I voted against it.
In the final vote, we voted in favour.
That is a terrible cost-benefit ratio.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Awaiting something better, I abstained.
That was not the case yesterday.
The EU must be limited and effective.
.
On behalf of Mr Antoni Macierewicz:
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
The stakes, however, are high.
.
.
.
.
.
Parliament rejects this.
.
That concludes the vote.
What should our strategy be?
Is this still possible?


Israel is a friend on the wrong track.
Who can help this friend at this stage?
Is it still serious about the roadmap?
We believe that both camps must disarm.
He did so behind closed doors.
How do we go on from here?
We here are a political body.
We are not judging intentions.
The road map is a plan in three phases.
There is no phased plan to peace.
In that case, there will be no peace.
An old man died at the checkpoint.
On what list are we going to put that?
It can work, if it gets time.
There is nothing else in sight.
It is exceedingly urgent.
It is an armed intifada.
The answer to that is 'no'.
What about Israel?
What can Europe do?
Just blacklist Hamas?
I do not think that is enough.
This was too much, however!
Serious mistakes have been made.
That is the Parliament's task.
Where did we go wrong?
Europe really did work as a team!
Secondly, who is to blame for that?
Could we have done more?
We wish not to impose but to persuade.
The second debate is the WTO reforms.
How and where?
Of that, at least, we can be proud.
So what was Canc√∫n about?
This is really self-evident.
How did this come about?
And whose fault was it?


Do our partners share that preference?

Why do I say that?
What, exactly, was on offer?
That is not all by a long way.
I think this is quite a bad omen.
Then there is the G-21.
Where do we go from here?
(The President cut off the speaker)
The Group of 21 has 21 negotiators.
What is to be done, then?
What is to be done about cotton?
I think that we are all to blame.
All that is true.
Who is to blame, then, and who is not?
I think there is a lot in that.
Unfortunately I have no more time left.
Who was to blame?
That would be a pity.
Which rules, though?
This implies two twin demands.
We must not, I feel, be masochistic.
It could go further, of course.
This debate is dragging on.
I agree with you.
I think it is too early to say.
I also agree with it.

However, they were scuppered.
Secondly, on the Singapore issues.
It was still an excellent proposal.
.




I think that would be nonsensical.
We need to dismantle the barriers here.
The same applies to priority works.
We had the Essen Council.


Here is a practical example.





The debate is closed.
The reverse is true.
You are not, but imagine that you are.
That is simply not possible.
Fine words.
We have to follow things through.
I wish to thank him for that.
This is an important area.
That is a lot.
The debate is closed.
.
There are many others.
Because the dates are crucial.
That is the first pillar.
The debate is closed.
.
That mystifies me absolutely.
This needs to be reviewed.
We have not got it right.
.
I agree with him.
Mr Cashman rightly pointed this out.
This would facilitate comparisons.
Some problems remain.
The rapporteur indicated as much.
This needs to be borne in mind.
Mrs Maij-Weggen is leaving the House.
I offer her my congratulations.
I would like to add my voice to his.
It is not possible to go that far.
What do you need?
Progress has definitely been made.
Guaranteeing access is not sufficient.
I think that that is a good idea.
I should like to thank him.
Certain areas really must be discussed.
It must not be too difficult.
We have also developed a friendship.
.
We have engineered a revolution.
They cannot be released.
I might not even be present myself.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
.
The logic is, indeed, very simple.
I will not go into them all.

It is going to cut plant damage.
This is an issue we cannot ignore.
We have to go forward with it.
Let the market be free.
Let us have some competition.
That is Amendment No 11.
The debate is closed.
Allow me to give a practical example.
We need more aid, but also better aid.
I was there.
That is a good thing.
We must not forget that.
One example is climate policy.
It does not have to be this way.
This brings me to the second point.
What have we been doing?
Thank you Commissioner.
Welcome
However, I have one or two points.
There is a second question, moreover.
Thank you, Mr S√∂derman
The debate is closed.
I am not in favour of nominalism.
We already miss her here in Parliament.
I think it has been a successful year.
It refused to pay.
They respond very well to our requests.
That is a shame.
I thank Mrs Gonz√°lez for her work.
We never turn a blind eye towards it.
It has no right of codecision, however.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(2002/2208(INI)).
.
Was the directive being applied then?
Let me be clear.
It fails to give a balanced assessment.
I will finish on this.
We are curious.
These are complex legal issues.
What emerges from this?
That is our only concern.
What emerges from this?
A few even took their own lives.
That is what I would like to say.
Mr Cashman has the floor.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the vote.
We now continue with the vote.
Joint motion for a resolution
The rest remains unchanged.
(Interjection by Mr Pannella)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Protests from Mr Pannella)
President.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That has been agreed.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
I supported Mrs Read's report.
This runs counter to transparency.
This latest alarm call was needed.
They can now offer some resistance.
This is an internal British squabble.
They should be ashamed.
This is going to run into the sand.
Why is that the case?
That is the first issue.
No exceptions can be allowed.
Thank you very much, Mr Leinen.


I do not acknowledge that possibility.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Commissioner Barnier has the floor.
Some aspects clearly overlap.
In the end, however, it was not that.
I would urge you to rethink.
However, we soon realised our mistake.
The debate is closed.

Let us not stop there, either.
You mentioned the ecosystem, Mr Berthu.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be on 9 October 2003.
The next item is the vote.
(Parliament adopted the text)
President.
That concludes the vote.


(The sitting was closed at 4.40 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
(1)
They get very few answers.
I hope they will sign it.
Thank you for raising the matter.
Almost 100 000 people attended.
¬†¬† That concludes the item.
There are two basic reasons.
Three factors have come together.
Thank you very much.
¬†¬† That concludes the item.
This, in itself, is exceptional.
In many cases, this is not the case.
Let us talk about the professions then.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.(1)
We know how that ended.
I can only advise against such a step.
It is investment that creates jobs.
I am just airing the question now.
Why?
This is a step. What can the other be?
This is the crux of the matter.
Where does the phased plan lead?
It is a road to nowhere.
We must take action.
Better late than never, however.

What adjustments can be made?

Such a measure is urgently needed.

Do you know why it worries me?
This leaves me entirely perplexed.
I really do not understand this.

¬†¬† Thank you, Minister.
The debate is closed.
And that is the real situation.





No agreement is perfect.
It is a bit of a mixed bag.
What an absurd view.
It is not true.
It is right that he should do that.
Let us hope it is the former.
The first is, of course, democracy.
Fourthly there is proportionality.
We should lead by example.
Thank you very much, Mr Corbett.
The joint debate is closed.
Let us then take up this challenge!
I should like to address two issues.
We cannot separate one from the other.
Now for my minute on space travel.
How are the two kept separate?
There is only research ‚Äì full stop.
The debate is closed.

I cannot agree with that opinion.
The market is changing.
I warn you against over-regulation.
That is very much to be wished.
¬†¬† .
That much is clear.
The debate is closed.
In tunnels, people feel shut in.
Let me start by pointing them out.

Thank you for that!
France has a similar tradition.
The choice is not difficult.
That much is true.
Any other consideration is secondary.
This is not acceptable.
It clearly is now.
But that is not enough.
We have to take that into account.
All these issues concern many MEPs.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
I will begin with the Road¬†Map.
He might have succeeded by now.
That is the bottom line.
Is there any hope?
This must be made very clear.
He cannot.
That would be my first point.
Here is my suggestion.
Think of Haifa!
I agree with Mrs¬†Morgantini on this.
We must believe in ourselves.
The , therefore, is unacceptable.
It is time for the killing to stop.
Mr High Representative,
- How far will we go?
- Where is Europe?
- Why is Europe paralysed?
The picture is clear.
I ask you that.
We are supporting this too.
They put up resistance.
What are we doing?
What is the EU doing?
A quarter of that period has elapsed.
That is not something I wish to see.
It is becoming increasingly difficult.
Mr¬†Poettering also referred to Iraq.
I should like to follow up on this.
No agreement was reached.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr¬†Monti.
¬†¬† Thishas been noted,Mr¬†Gollnisch.
The debate is closed.
(1)
I hope that is clear to the House.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We can do better.
I therefore voted in favour of it.

The results obtained are impressive.
Europe needs to be in space.
This initiative must be fully welcomed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Why has this health disaster occurred?
The facts speak for themselves.
This is an important issue.
(1)
(2)
But this is a very specific statement.
¬†¬† ‚Äì I am happy to do that.
I agree with the whole of the report.
It could have started as early as 2002.
News of this compromise is welcome.
For all that, is it sufficient?
This must be avoided.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Still, we have to look to the future.
In short, there is confusion all round.
In addition, blue flags cost money.
I think this is wrong.
What will the Commission do then?
Will we be closing beaches?
Who is going to be counting?
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
What, then, is this about?
That is an approach I strongly support.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Congratulations, Mr Lange.
That is first-rate!
We will have to re-examine this.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
We certainly do not want that.
How was the transaction conducted?
It is high time this changed.
When will they reply?
These are the facts.
We have the capacities.
We have the knowledge.
This is what I have asked for.
Is this wise overall?
It is important to say that.
That seems less dangerous.
As yet we do not have a legal case.
We have asked for more information.
The debate is closed.
Firstly, in respect of the budget.
Some still do not do so.
We will then be clearly lagging behind.
I think that we owe it to them.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
An agreement has now been reached.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
(1)
It was not altogether clear.
We are against.
Let me turn now to the Savary report.
That is a very regrettable development.
I think that this is important.
They need it.
This is progress.
I would like to cite two examples.
They will also increase safety.
We happen not to agree on the subject.
Europe needs to learn from experience.
This truly is the primary objective.
Careful preparations will be made.
Liberalisation is also an issue.
We must not adopt a blinkered approach.
We are of course also eager to do so.
A balance seems to have been reached.
I informed the Council accordingly.
The texts are practically finished.
Modernisation is sorely needed.
It must remain so.
A number of them may prove problematic.
We are in agreement on that point.
I do hope that the Council adopts this.
¬†¬† Mr Sterckx on a point of order.
The same applies to air transport.
I think this is a paradox.
That clearly is not the case.
I hope we do not throw it away.
The second principle is this.
The third principle is as follows.
I need not name them.
Try explaining that to the electorate.
They take liberalisation too far.
Traffic has to come off the roads.
TGV is not an option for us.
I just do not understand this.
This is a part of our problem.
This variable is essential.
This must be remedied.
That is what we are about.
The time for monopolies is past.
That is how monopolies operate.
Freight has to be sought out.
The railways need finance.
We should go back to that.
Not in my view.
Does it have to result in job losses?
Again, the answer is no.
That is the first task.
Competition will then come about.
The need for funds was also mentioned.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mrs de Palacio.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† We now continue with the vote.
‚Äì That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Are we really focusing on our forests?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Will this remain a dream?
¬†¬† .
Now, the stakes are high.
¬†¬† .
That gives us cause for regret.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† I was in Paris Mr¬†President.
Fantastic!
¬†¬† .
- greater intercultural dialogue;
- awareness of languages;
- development of lifelong learning;
- exchanges of good practice.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What did I see Mr¬†President?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Could I vote against it, Mr¬†President?
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour of this report.
(2)
¬†¬† . ‚Äì Many thanks, Mr¬†President.
I shall come back to that later.
We did this for two reasons.
Parliament takes a different view.
We shall keep a close eye on this.
¬†¬† .
My position on this is quite clear.
¬†¬† .
The rapporteur has done a good job.
It contained two interrelated problems.
The biggest problem is with category 4.
I would like to mention a few of them.
For this I thank him.
That you know.
How will we cope afterwards?
Firstly, Iraq.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
We want to see that reserve lifted.
We want to see that reserve lifted.
The third point is not contentious.
This is a very important matter.
I do not think so.
I do not think that is the way.
Something is clearly wrong!
This leads me to reform.
From Latin America?
From Asia?
From Africa?
From the Mediterranean?
Where are you going to get it from?

Quite the contrary!
Let me add something political.
Thank you very much!

So much for my first point.
In July I visited Belarus.
Not one penny.
That is not good enough.
This I find a good thing.
There is nothing to prevent this.
Our accounting is consistent.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is currently under legal analysis.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What can we do if that happens?
¬†¬† .
But there are issues involved here.
¬†¬† .
This is completely unnecessary.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
So, the issue is under consideration.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I take note of what you have said.
¬†¬† .
There is therefore nothing to abrogate.
¬†¬† .
Once again that is not good.
What will happen I do not know.
We are working to that end.
I was in Washington last week.
¬†¬† .
These are the two solutions.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We must increase the minimum sum.
I have confidence in this.
It will receive my unqualified support.
Why is it important?
And so, my thanks to all.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
What could constitute such a system?
We were a very distinguished vintage.
It has in actual fact been admirable.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The first point: where are we today?
I do not think so.
No, we cannot.
It is a rule of good management.
You have stressed this point.
I admit that they are complicated.
I think that we can simplify them.
That is my aim.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
So much for my first comment.
Health must come first in this case.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Such a result was only to be expected.
This is very much to be welcomed.
I am glad that it has done so.
This is my first request.
We have had major problems in the past.
This is an improvement.
This depends on the German Government.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
(1)
... provided that they observe the law.
We are in favour of free trade.
This is not an option.
How we get there is another story.
What does MAP bring to the deal?
The problem is how to achieve this.
Malaysia dedicates 35% to these areas.
What is involved?
What precisely is involved?
Thank you for your attention.
Where do we go from here?
That is the difference.
We are alongside you in doing so.
This is a much more serious issue.
That would make it completely useless.
We very much look forward to that.
Look at Europe, this Europe!
They are cheapskate proposals.
Well this has not happened.
Why are we concerned?
How should we respond to this tendency?
That is the question.
Beware of rhetoric!
Reality will be your downfall.
This is why we need this constitution.

The United States manage 3%.
This is a tragic waste.
The UN is paralysed by US vetoes.
Sermonising serves no purpose.
Has it been heeded?
Well, opinions may differ about that.
I am going to refer to three points.
Commitments rather than words.

We do not need anything new.
We had anticipated this all along.
Carry on!









Together we have to do this.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The amendments are:
¬†¬† .
Hence my vote in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
(2)
Things used not to be as bad as that.
Thank you very much.
¬†¬† .
We have strong views about terrorism.
Reference has been made to Iran.
I would like to highlight two examples.
Well, ladies and gentlemen ...
All the best!
Will this institution do its job?
Will it enjoy effective powers?
I certainly hope so.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
It is an important development.
¬†¬† .
Let us be clear.
Another example is the Basque Country.
But what do the Russia-bashers want?
Only Russia can deliver that.
We must not blot out unpleasant issues.
What, then, should we be calling for?
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
We have weighed up the pros and cons.
¬†¬† .
In the end, the text was withdrawn.
That was the situation in 1999.
The risk of defeat?
China is the worst of them all.
I doubt it.
The death penalty must be abolished.
It is not negotiable.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
The debate is closed.
This is one step, but it is not enough.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
I think that they were very clear.
This is the first sign.

This is how things stand.
This is the state of affairs.




We must make it a social choice.









Moreover, not every donor is suitable.
My country should take this to heart.

What kind of information was there?
[COM(2003) 130 ‚Äì 2003/2104(INI)].
That is very serious.
Any further cuts will be fatal.
The fishermen said this was rubbish.
So who is right?

Secondly, it calls for certain reports.
This is the fourth attempt.
But it is not all good.
We can no longer ignore ICES.
'Where there is a will there is a way'.
The question is how.
The same goes for sport fishing.
There is no proposal to do this.
I suppose it is a start, though.
Time has proved us to be right.

The status quo is no longer an option.
I am obliged to reject Amendment No 14.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
(1)
¬†¬† .
(2)
(3)
(4)
That concludes the votes.(5)
We have voted against this measure.
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† Mr President, I am concerned.
¬†¬† .
That is why I voted for this report.
¬†¬† .
Hence my vote in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Other opponents had better reasons.
This mugging of democracy has to stop.
That is quite nonsensical.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Our own vision is the opposite.
We have voted against this report.
I thank Mr¬†Brok for his clarity.
¬†¬† .
For these reasons, I abstained.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is to miss the point.
¬†¬† .
I feel that that is clear in ‚Ä¶
¬†¬† .
Is it, however, enough to say that?
(6)
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
They were simply decommissioned.
What did the Commission do?
It helped make it legal.
It has made an illegal situation legal.
It has done the same with the Dutch.
That is the wrong signal to send out.
That should also be investigated.
I digress.
In addition, we must not stand still.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
It therefore has the force of a treaty.
¬†¬† .


Allow me to make some summary comments.
Impact assessments are needed too.
So far, my efforts have been in vain.
In any case, they will be insufficient.
¬†¬† .
I will begin with tobacco.
A clear option is being taken.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
A peace process is currently under way.
¬†¬† .
What have we done so far?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Just compare that with our resolution.
President Niyazov renamed himself.
He renamed the days of the week.
From 1985 he has ruled as a tyrant.
He should never have been charged.
It summoned him home for treatment.
The first is the strategic goals.
Ignoring that region will not do.
There is every reason for this.
We must stand up for freedom of belief.
That leaves Kyrgyzstan.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
We now have a delegation there.
¬†¬† .
We would be very grateful for that.
The joint debate is closed.(1)
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.(1)
That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
(The sitting was closed at 5.10 p.m.)
They are very welcome.
Thank you.
Any majority would be quite fortuitous.
I shall not follow that suggestion.
Our direct intervention is needed.
I should like you to intervene.
We have a hostage here.
We need to intervene in this matter.
That concludes the item.
Thank you very much.
They are very welcome.
¬†¬† .
Next year will be decisive for Turkey.
We continue to hope this will happen.
We did not even give it a second look.

It is a statement of fact.
Now for my second question.
My third point has to do with Turkey.
I knew that this would happen.
Where, then, if not in this House?
I am in full agreement with that.
The results were very interesting.
I would like an answer.
My sincere congratulations on this.
This is an important point.
So am I, to say the least.
The military have lost nothing there.
There is no question about that.
I have three questions.

That is the current situation.
Would it be fair to say that?
I am not aware of this having happened.
Thank you.
We need Turkey on our side.
The public also needs to be told this.
I ask for your understanding.
That concludes the item.
We owe it to our citizens.
Failure would make losers of us all.
I will give you just two examples.
Firstly, qualified majority voting.




It will be a red line for us.
The citizens?
They are the sole legislators.
Another step forward: Euratom.
I could go on. The attacks are fierce.
This is not the way!
That is the way.
Nice is the Treaty in force.
The European Union must not fail.
There is no glossary.
Is it Estonia‚Äôs fault?
Poland‚Äôs?
We are back in Nice again!
That is technically possible.
Frankly, that is unacceptable.
That is what we should aim for.

They hardly even need a European Union.
That is definitely unacceptable.
¬†¬† .
That is all a change in the substance.


¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
I should now like to focus on content.
They are the water carriers.

Well, they are in Asia.
And there are 800 million of them.
Why are we even considering this?
Why a simple regulation?
Why a single regulation?
I could not agree more.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is the joint debate:
But it is not our fault.
We like to work carefully.
This time, again, we were not able to.
And it can be checked by the courts.
We will vote in favour of it.
Now I do not know what to say.
What are those realities?
That is the problem.
Therefore we had to find a solution.
It chose the difficult way.
There are dozens of them, Mr President.
What remains to be done now, then?
¬†¬† Mr President, the risk is clear.
That much is very clear.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Their names deserve to be mentioned.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.




The agencies will have no controllers.
There are more and more of them.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
That seems to be working.
That is quite clear.
Matters cannot continue like this.
These are important points of view.
What is all the fuss about?!'
But that is a detail for another day.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† (1).
It is necessary to find a balance.
I can subscribe to these words today.
For the latter is beyond our powers!
We could list a whole host of things.


For what was the case at Renault?
That was the big problem.
No, it is the Belgian Government.
I have another two specific questions.
¬†¬† .
Now it is time for measures!
That is our first question.
There are numerous social directives.
Including here.
Our second priority is employment.
I agree with that.
That is vitally important.
Finally, a word of warning.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Who determines the laws?
Who personifies public power?
The answer is, none.
No, that is not the reason, either.
None of us are saints.
That is something we must change.
Why is the EU not interesting?
If we had 50%, that would be parity.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.(1)
¬†¬† We now continue with the vote.
That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is what democracy is all about.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against the report.
¬†¬† .
I have therefore voted in favour.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I welcome in particular:
¬†¬† .
Can anyone take this seriously?
¬†¬† .
A chance we cannot afford to miss!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is what happens in normal practice.
I therefore think we must say no.
(1)
This is extremely odd.
What is the reason for that?
It is very obvious.
¬†¬† .
There are three basic objectives:
You mentioned transport.
Regrettably, this did not happen.
What do we see?
Can a year really make any difference?
Such was not the case with this one.
I share that view.
Disability policy is not a policy area.
The first is the new Member States.
They bring the courage.
It is not a matter of isolated cases.
¬†¬† .
I shall explain what I mean at once.
And I have explained the reasons.
They were not easy, I can assure you.
We are not talking about application.
So that is the situation today.
I have spoken about legislation.
It is not a question of courage here.
I really cannot accept that statement.
Emotions have run high in recent weeks.
Amendments 7, 17 and 18 clarify this.
I appeal to colleagues to think again.
Our position is therefore unambiguous.
He lost.
Today‚Äôs vote blazes a trail.
That time is now.
That is the crucial question.
That is what this is really about.
What is wrong with this logic?
I am in favour of stem cell research.
Why, however?
This has nothing to do with science.
What is the purpose of a cut-off date?
Now to the matter of dates.
It was a very long way from the truth.
It is not justified on ethical grounds.
Yes to research.
There are two aspects to this.
Why the dates?
Talk of life and death distort reality.
I am against artificial deadlines.
I support their protests.
Under what conditions?
Most of us are not scientific experts.
Abortion is carried out quite legally.
Let me say something to Mr Cappato.
You were already unique.
There is a public outcry in Ireland.
A lot has happened since 2002.
That is significantly fewer.
I cannot be clearer than that.
That is consistent.
That is a sign of Europe‚Äôs greatness.
But there is also a value: research.
We are nowhere near doing that.
What is to be done?
There is no time to lose.
We have much to learn from them.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The IDA programme is more complicated.
The new programme will be called IDABC.
I will not go into the detail.
¬†¬† .
That really is not good enough.
¬†¬† .
I strongly support their flexibility.

Is there really universal access?
We do not know.
There again, there is no opinion.
This is provided for until 2005.
We therefore support these projects.
What is the reason for this?
Why do we do this?
What exactly is it proposing to do?
The Commission needs to be tougher.
This position is unacceptable.
We must keep to what we have decided.
That is only fair for everyone.
That is European innovation.
¬†¬† .
I have a few comments.
Regulation is not the purpose here.
We are waiting for the reply.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
Diesel fuel tax is one such area.
That is precisely what this is about.
I would appreciate a concrete response.
¬†¬† .
Let me give you some figures.
Then there is Luxembourg.
Now why should that be the case?
I am not so pessimistic.
It is certainly not the case.
It is beneficial to the environment.
But you cannot explain.
It is an open-and-shut case.
The debate is closed.
(1)
(1)
That also needs to be said, ...
... but that is not my main point.
We are trying to be objective.
It is essential to speak the truth.
I said more besides.
No doubt we shall find out then.
We all are.
He stated the outlook was set fair.
This is a crucially important request.
There is certainly one in Spanish.
No, apparently not.
We want to see results.
That is just not enough, however.
The culture must be changed.
Lastly, the question of Eurostat.
No, Mr¬†Prodi, you have not.
You bear full responsibility.
Where are those 18 missing contracts?
Who will obtain them?
Step down.
The Europe of reform, President Prodi?
Such is the state of the Union.
We need a swift decision here.
The first concerns foreign policy.
Are they still going on?
The size of the sum taken, maybe?
That is necessary.
That is wrong.
I would like us to ...
Actions speak louder than words.
We need results in 2004.
We are not involved.
Further reform is needed.
The objective remains unfixed.
These measures are doomed to failure.
You can count on our support over this.
As I said, this is curious.
What planet is he on?
Is this anything more than empty words?
Topics should be interlinked.
What is the Council's position on that?
That must change.
That must change too.
Eurostat is a case in point.
We must act now.
For that you have our entire support.

I shall endeavour to be brief.
It should be reversed.
This will be decided by OLAF.
This comment, though, hung in the air.
This is a curious body with two souls.
He cannot be denied that right.
It simply does not make sense.
You woke up to this five months later.
That is your problem.
Clearly, these points of view diverge.
That concludes the item.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Mr¬†President, I am at a loss.
That amendment has now disappeared.
I want to know where it is.
¬†¬† .
‚Äì That concludes the vote.

This position is unacceptable.
I cannot but vote against it.
Are there any comments?
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Patakis.
That is not correct.
The maritime sector is no exception.
It is important to bear this in mind.
This is no mere formality.
¬†¬† .
To wait and see is not an option.
Why is Europe aiming so high?
Nonetheless, are there no concerns?
Are there no questions?
There are.

¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
One can see a certain logic in this.
Far from it.
Things can evidently go the other way.
Not everyone is pleased with it.
This is very unfortunate.
More room means growth and employment.
Enough has been said about pilotage.
However, it is not too late.

You spoke about coherence.
This exchange is anything but fair.
This is the twenty-first century.
That is the Europe I believe in.
Perhaps some people want that.
Let me remind you of Article 12.
Hence our vote against this proposal.
The word was ‚Äòmust‚Äô.
We reject this directive.
We are opposed to it.
The intention has already been erased.
There is no way around this.
The reverse is true.
This has not turned out to be the case.
And that is what we are proposing.
What is so worrying in Belgium?
It is true: they will be able to.
I would have no objection.
It is not.
Water, as you know, is life.
Subject: Reconstruction of Iraq
That is what describes the situation.
¬†¬† There is another solution.
The debt is grossly unfair.
¬†¬† . ‚Äì I tried to explain this.
What Ireland is doing is fine.
That is not so easy to do in practice.
I find it a discourtesy to colleagues.
But it is not a lack of courtesy.
We all know that.
The figures speak for themselves.
We must also keep innovating.
Now we need the HPV alongside it.
Lung cancer is the most deadly.
We need more PET scanners.
We need to highlight these disparities.
We need the cancer networks.
Screening means diagnosis.
Diagnosis means lives saved.
It is important to have this debate.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
This sort of thing has to be tackled.
Now that will not be enough either.
The human factor is also a risk.
Three types of measure are in progress.
Voting rules are slightly problematic.
I welcome that.
The importance of the Agency is clear.
What was it about?
So this is where we have got to.
A start has been made, however.
Efficiency ‚Äì what efficiency?
Speed is of the essence.
The debate is closed.
Clarity is needed in the shorter term.
There is a lack of clear criteria.
We must now hold this political debate.
The latter is particularly welcome.
There is no specific impact assessment.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
What is Parliament contributing?
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Batch systems can work.
Let me take you through a scenario.
Congratulations, Mr Adam.
We are all unanimous in this view.
This does nothing for the industry.
Where is it traceable to?
How can there be traceability there?
This is the people talking.
The debate is closed.



¬†¬† .
We need to be aware of that.
That is the heart of the matter here.
We deeply appreciate that work.
We never liked the Treaty of Nice.
One hopes that this is a wise decision.
These are not minor issues.
That would clearly be foolish.
How should we respond to this?
Well! Should we rejoice at this?
We should not trust still waters.
Let me give you an example.

What is this all about?
It is Parliament that does this.
A number of questions remain.
In the UK that number is 86%.
That is not a democratic situation.
That is the simple truth.
I cannot see how else we could proceed.
¬†¬† .
What role is it to play?
Development cooperation?
Whatever is needed and more.
I hope that you will forgive me.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Do not worry, Mr Lisi.
The language services will be informed.
I refer to Amendments Nos 11 and 12.
¬†¬† .
I give the floor to Mr¬†Chichester.
Could you clarify the situation?
(1)
I voted in favour.
I fully agree.
I voted in favour.

¬†¬† .
This is clearly a very sensitive issue.
We have to be very careful.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

These, therefore, are the reasons.
We have visions but little practice.
That is where there are deficits.
It is a major asset for Europe.
We need aid organisations here quickly.
I do not think so.
In fact, there is no such sovereignty.
Why are matters like this?
I have three children of my own.
I am very pleased to hear it.
We need cooperation, not confrontation.
You have also spoken about Arjan Erkel.
That is extremely important.
What has happened since then?
The same is true of the media.
It has joined the Council of Europe.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be on Thursday.
I will say very precisely why.
We are on the same wavelength.
So please think this point over again.
Let us not run before we can walk!
We do not want any new division.
Europe has changed.

That is why I fear this uniformity.
I understand his fears.
That is the issue.
Enlargement will have a limit.
I am rather surprised by this.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
Poverty causes sickness.
All of the others will be in.
There is no escaping this.
Then you mentioned Kaliningrad.
That is quite impossible.
I can offer you full reassurance here.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be on Thursday.
¬†¬† .
So far we have not received any reply.

¬†¬† .
Everybody seems to acknowledge this.
¬†¬† .
The position cannot change.
Once again, this has to be my answer.
I cannot offer you any solution.
I just wish to remind us of this.
My supplementary question...
(5)
That is good news.
This is completely unacceptable.
That is our fundamental objection here.
That brings me to my final point.
It is a good question.
Dassault is selling the Rafale.
We must be honest.
Hard training makes for easy battles.
We owe them nothing less.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We will adopt a neutral position.
In conclusion, the final topic.
We will need an agreement for this.
Firstly, financial assistance.
¬†¬† .
Things could get even better.
My congratulations to Mr Lagendijk.

Allow me to make three observations.
That is by the by.
Within the next two years!
They are also their citizens.
And now, a comment outside my speech.
There is a technical issue.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Howitt.
The debate is closed.
We regard this as progress.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mrs Stenzel.
The debate is closed.
The subject is frighteningly important.
We reject it and we will vote against.
No, it is something else.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We must deliver such action.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Watson.
The debate is closed.(1)

The formal sitting is closed.
¬†¬† .
This has been immensely helpful.
¬†¬† .
This is another key dimension.
So what citizenship are we discussing?
This is regrettable.
This point must be crystal clear!
Why?
That is the situation we are in.

We want to ensure quality.
We want unity rather than polyphony.

Let me give you just two examples.
¬†¬† .
I am sure Mr Sacr√©deus agrees.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at noon.

‚Äì I give the floor to Mr¬†Bowis.

If not, we will proceed to the vote.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
We worked together very well.
(1)
(2)
¬†¬† .
I think we all agree on that.
(3)
¬†¬† .

I voted in favour.
¬†¬† ‚Äì.
This warrants my full support.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence my vote against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
There is absolutely no argument here.
It is unacceptable.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
(4)
They are not in jeopardy.


Yes.
Yes.
Do the Info-Points help meet that need?
Yes.
Yes.
That is questionable.
That really is not good enough.
The tail is wagging the dog.
Experts should be on tap, not on top.
All that remains is to implement it.
It rocked the boat and people panicked.
We are certainly not doing that.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Growth stands at around 5% this year.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
This has to stop.
Today, Aceh is in a state of emergency.
They are on duty in Aceh.
He is right.
In reality, the army is still in power.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
The reality, though, is something else.
¬†¬† .
We do not understand.
We must therefore take a stand.
We cannot continue like this.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That ends the joint debate.
We will now proceed to the vote.(1)
¬†¬† That completes the agenda.(1)
Are there any comments?
¬†¬† .
(1)
Last week was no exception.
Let us start at the beginning, however.
We must not cede on this point.
They have been charged with no crimes.
There must be no repeat of Nice!
That is the situation.
You must get that into your head.
You must talk to the Poles.
You must talk to the Spanish.
I wish it every success in doing so.
Overall openness will diminish.
No comment.
This is the picture.
Bravo.
Bravo.
This is a genuine political initiative.
Time is marching on.
I do not think it will work.
Keep on trying to reach agreement.
I, too, have my criticisms of Naples.
The situation is getting no better.
What about Europe‚Äôs dignity?
Nobody said a word about that.
This House‚Äôs position is clear.
It will be a yardstick for confidence.
Let us pause and reflect upon this.
Malta will have five.
As a Scot, how could I think otherwise?
Do not do that.
This is not a trivial point.
I was not heeded.
My appeal was neglected.
What a pity!
They are talking about other issues.
I welcome that.
I welcome any progress achieved.
What is going on now is embarrassing.
Do you never learn?
The EU faces huge tasks.
That is wholly unacceptable.
What could be fairer?
There was deadlock.
Why would that be?
No.
That is right and proper.
I will reply briefly to Mr De Rossa.
It is pointless for us to hide it.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
¬†¬† .
Let us move on to procedural matters.
The Commission excluded it.
The Pact has been called ‚Äòstupid‚Äô.


It was not a good day for European law.
This argument is utterly false.
Today‚Äôs debts are tomorrow‚Äôs taxes.
That is why the policy is wrong.
I really do ask that of you.
Are they any different?
This is extremely serious.
We need a political actor in Brussels.
This is a matter of urgency.
I say again: the reform is essential.
We also need acts.
The Pact is too rigid.
It could do nothing else.
The law must be respected.
As we all know, it will not.
Let us bury this Pact!
That is not acceptable.
This is very serious.
Left France and Germany free to act?
The euro is part of the problem.
The Pact is flexible enough as it is.
However, it is not enough on its own.
This is what we must consider.
Dual standards.
That was the real tragedy.
Would there be a euro, Commissioner?
How very simple!
The substance is the same.
There was total compliance.
We need European governance.

¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† This item has been dealt with.
'Europe begins in the regions'.
What about the sustainable town?
All these things matter.
This phase has already begun.
¬†¬† .
This issue has to be addressed.
The reality is rather different.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
I now turn to the individual points.
I now turn to your report.
We should work on this together.
We are aware of this.
It is unacceptable.
That is quite wrong, in our view.
Eurostat is a case in point.
We need a strong OLAF.
Let us move onto the report.
We cannot tolerate this.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
It is asking you to do something.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Mr President, it is me again.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
This is a fundamental right.
Be courageous. Accept the challenge.
¬†¬† .

I want the principle to be accepted.
I am deeply saddened.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
That really is not the case.
¬†¬† .
The Commission made it four years.
This is why they are experiments.
That is the standard rate.
But Annex K will no longer exist.
¬†¬† .
I use them as they come in.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Nonetheless, the figure remains high.
Progress was noted in all areas.
The latter would be a risky venture.
Simply launching plans is not enough.
I trust it will be taken into account.
It is our accountant.
That worked in our opinion.
Is it possible to develop indicators?
Enlargement is one example.
I shall come back to them later.
The surplus remains considerable.
Serious shortcomings have been noted.
I believe that this is a real problem.
Much does certainly remain to be done.
I believe we are on the right track.
That is how things stand.
She also called for more democracy.
That is the problem.
We are working to harmonise them.
Thank you for your attention.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
This can be made simpler and faster.
This is hopelessly complicated.
That too is a vast improvement.
Wonderful!
We do not yet have a European card.
I am infinitely grateful to you all.
There are very few criticisms here.
‚ÄìThat concludes the debate.
The vote will take place shortly.
¬†¬† .
(1)
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
(1)
(2)
¬†¬† ‚ÄìWe now continue with the vote.
‚ÄìThat concludes the vote.

It is a modern form of colonialism.


I voted for the report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It can be criticised, however, for:
Hence our abstention from the vote.
¬†¬† .
It is a challenge and an opportunity.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is a modern form of colonialism.
¬†¬† .
There are also other positive effects.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against the resolution.
¬†¬† .
This is simply unacceptable!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This will lead to chaos.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The deadlines were abysmal.
¬†¬† I should like to clarify matters.
¬†¬† We have made several points here.
I was opposed to it.
We cannot accept this resolution.
Anonymity is another important issue.
Finally, a word on organs.
So be it!
It is their only ray of hope.
Who are these people?
Who are these people?
We now have a compromise.
That is the way forward.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The rest we can leave to the markets.
There is no reason to go further.
There is no doubt about that.
It does no harm, it does some good.
That is why the references are there.
¬†¬† .


There is more.

What is happening now?
I think that is incredibly strange.
That is absolutely fundamental.
There must be certain rights.
There is no choice.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you, Mr President.
Without jobs, Europe will not survive.
The reason for that is simple.
¬†¬† .
That is a long way off.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
These facts no longer hold true.
The complications are now evident.
What is this all about?
They are taxable in all other cases.
The debate is closed.
We need this big stick.
This does not seem to be the case.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you, Mr President.
Allow me to take a practical example.
We have little room to manoeuvre.
It is a key point here.
Who is it going to be?
I hope they go through.
That is essential.
The polluter pays, and so he should.
I have to get something off my chest.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
However, the issue is an important one.
There is not much dividing us.
It must be clear and simple.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
(1)
(1)

The Convention did a good job.
Alone or together?
Divided or united?

In this responsibility we all share.
I believe this is an important fact.
The Convention has produced this text.
We have 95%.
It showed neither.
By your own standards, you have failed.
That is nothing to be pleased about.
We cannot accept such a view.
There is the rub.
A convention will not be enough either.
I hope you will tell me that it is.
We are forced to meet in Strasbourg.
That is not the case.
What can be done?
Whom do I mean by ‚Äòyou‚Äô?
The second is one of substance.
Nobody was against it.
You were the cause of your own failure.
You never question yourselves.
We must have gone the wrong way.‚Äô
No.
Ask the people.
It is still on the table.
Therein lies the danger facing Europe.
What then has led to this failure?
This is no great tragedy.
We can still do this.
It can all be resolved in due course.
Which of these two views is right?
That above all must be avoided.
We need the new Constitution.
We must recover our common sense.
Many Members have done that already.
I very much regret that.
That is not the way to build peace.
Long live the Constitution!
Some Member States said yes, others no.
Everyone has granted me that.
If only.
(1)
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† Thank you very much Mrs Lulling!
You always keep the House up to speed.
¬†¬† .
Have a nice lunch!
(1)
That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour of this report.
¬†¬† .
We obviously voted against the report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì Mr President.

¬†¬† .
We voted against this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

We voted for the latter.
These days, companies are commodities.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you and .
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
(2)
I wish to make that proposal now.
Would that be possible?
Section I European Parliament
Section II ‚Äì Council
Section III ‚Äì Commission
Section IV Court of Justice
Section V Court of Auditors
Section VII Committee of the Regions
Section VIII(A) European Ombudsman
We will put 25 posts in reserve.
My thanks for this.
¬†¬† .
Secondly, to advocate greater reform.
Complacency will lead to gridlock.
This budget achieves value for money.
The pace of reform has to speed up.
It is an historic budget.

But even then it was high drama!
We have to start trusting each other.
There is budgetary discipline.
Now they are to be phased out.
Terrific!
This is something I consider essential.
We are therefore adopting a middle way.
We need to make preparations now.
Naturally, we will be voting for it.
About time, too.
This is a vast amount of public money.


And for what?
It most definitely is not.
Credit must be given where it is due.
We have to get tough.
What does Ecofin consist of?
That is the main problem at this time.
Last year it was Afghanistan.
But we have to forget about that.
What does it do?
We are already unpopular.
We greatly appreciate this.
The debate is closed.
Thus concludes our budget debate.
The occupation must end immediately.
I hope you have understood my question.
What did Mr¬†Nogueira ask?
¬†¬† . ‚Äì No.
That is all I wanted to say.
That is what my question relates to.
¬†¬† .
All I can do is repeat what I said.
Are they economic difficulties?
We must try to do more.
I am not currently able to reply.
I have just one more question.
¬†¬† I do indeed believe so, yes.
So far, nothing has been done.
I therefore await clarification.
¬†¬† I understood perfectly.
Innovations come at a price.
This would not make any sense.
We will be very vigilant on this point.
¬†¬† .
Third, the environmental aspects.
Finally, information to patients.
I will focus on just a few points.
I will remind you of just one figure.
They have done very good work.
Mr Liikanen may say that is impossible.
We asked what the dates were.
They gave us the dates.
This is a very bad way of proceeding.
The ten years has been dropped.
That is a good thing.
We shall hold the Commission to this.
We in the Verts/ALE Group welcome this.
That is a major step forward.
We need to speed up procedures.
All this is very positive.
I am still sceptical.
I think we have achieved a great deal.
May I add some criticisms, however?
That is an omission.
I am genuinely sad about this.
I agree with Mrs¬†Corbey‚Äôs comments.
I think that that is a shame.
We have missed an opportunity.
I recognise all that they have done.
Why such generosity?
I object.
This is not a food safety issue.
This will cost the taxpayer less.
I will come back to that in a moment.
That is of particular importance.
That is very important.
I take a different view.
Surely!
When will you ever learn?
It has done that for centuries.
You will drive it underground.
That is what you must do.
But we have that problem.
This sends out the wrong message.
Europe is about much more than this.
Europe can be much more than this.
That is the way forward.
You must be flexible.
It is chickening out of the situation.
I echo again what Mr Nicholson said.
That is what we are being asked for.
I would like you to look at the texts.
I want to be very precise here.
We will do that early in 2004.
He mentioned a case in Bratislava.
Permanent derogations are exceptional.
So we need to pursue innovation.
We must support innovation.
Compare the costs for a moment.
They remain at the same price level.
That is the balance we want to achieve.
¬†¬† I am always polite.
It is a political position.
You do not have a point of order.
They are important.
I will make myself clear.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, please!
We fully support it.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

¬†¬† .
Our citizens will not accept this.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
We worked well together.
I congratulate the rapporteur again.
Do we need it to the extent envisaged?
I doubt it very much.
Are we not on the wrong track?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
It would be as well to remember this.
Why?
Why?
We must therefore resolve this issue.
We have said it all before.
The second is the retirement age.
The third is national taxation.
A good start is half the battle.
That is the very most we can accept.
The deadline, then, is 15 January.
So what is this about?
I do not want to go over old ground.
As a result, we shall vote for it.
They are paid by the State as a whole.
Let us call a spade a spade.
The debate is closed.(1)
The vote will be at noon.

The committee has been quite active.
Please let us avoid a repeat of Rwanda.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
China is no small player.
We do not believe the time is ripe.
That would be terrible.
But of course!
Terrific!
I am also thinking of Taiwan.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
(1)
The House has voted wisely and well.
(2)
(3)
That concludes the vote.
I regard that as unacceptable.
It is not acceptable
¬†¬† .
The issue is its content.
This would be totally incomprehensible.
Hence our vote against the report.
It is not acceptable
¬†¬† .
That was a milestone.
Shame on them!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Let us see how that works first.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This would be irresponsible.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Road safety must be a priority.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour of the report.
This is a war-torn country.
(4)
It is also the right one.
Why is this so?
No, I do not believe that it is.
This, again, I ask you to support.
This new technology is fantastic.
¬†¬† I thank the honourable Member.
This is also accepted by the Council.
We have also reviewed the timetable.
This requires modern technology.
That is taking matters too far.
Why do we insist on doing this?
They are necessary.
This is only reasonable.
That is crucial.
A dynamic Europe needs road transport.
The debate is closed.
However, we could go no further.
My group will endorse it.
Austria does not want that solution.
Nobody wants it.
Is that really your intention?
It will apply for the whole of Austria.
But then it disappeared again.
That is my position.
That is a .
Of course we can.
What should the solution be?
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

We are counting on that.
But that cannot be the case at all.
I welcome many of the features.
I hope that will end.
That was not to be.
We must therefore deal with it.
I hope so but I am not altogether sure.
The debate is closed.
That was less than in previous years.
The situation is unacceptable.
I am sure you agree with me.
I had to say that first.
Not surprisingly his health suffered.
That is why it is an accession issue.
¬†¬† I agree with Mr Bowis.
It is one that I am happy to answer.
I agree with you, Mrs McKenna.
This must be made very clear.
That is how he addressed the results.
I had a long talk with him.
There is a point of order.
I then asked a follow-on question.
I shall continue in French.
That is my first question.
And that is not unfair competition.
Perhaps UPS flies to Athens.
And that is how competition works.
That is another story, however.
That was our reply a few days ago.
I have already said this today.
I think we worked well together.

We are pioneers in this field.
It means Christmas Holiday Package.

That concludes the debate.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 11.30 a.m tomorrow.
It covers the period from 2004 to 2006.
A great deal remains left to be done.
We all know this as well.
That is what I wish to call for now.
We have not fulfilled our pledges.
It is completely unacceptable.
This is mainstreaming.
That concludes the debate.
That is what this report is about.
There must be clarity.
They are fully entitled to do so.
We have legislation on the subject.
He mentioned organic farming.
How does the consumer react?
We know too little about this.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
They generate over 30¬†000 local jobs.
This is true for both sides.
I express my regret for the delay.
This is no exception.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
(1)
(1)
¬†¬† .
Two out of three sufferers are women.
It will lead to concrete action.
They are unnecessary and divisive.
Allow me to tell a personal story.
I have told this story for two reasons.
We have no problems with travel.
MS demands our attention.
That is as it should be.
MS patients deserve better.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
So we can set an example.
And the answers are not always easy.
In spite of this, nothing is happening.
Why not?
Let us be logical.
That cannot work.
Abuse is a separate problem.

The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.

¬†¬† .
(1)
The two issues must be kept separate.
Let me make a comment on Galileo.
Amendment Nos 43 and 48 are identical.
¬†¬† We have had the debate on that.
We are now voting.
So please reject Amendment No 5.
That concludes the vote.
I wish you a happy Christmas.
¬†¬† .
That is why I voted against it.
So be it!
This is not a responsible attitude.
We reject this idea.
We therefore voted against this report.
The IGC needs to come to a conclusion.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is incomprehensible and derisory!
Surely not.
Quite the opposite.
I voted against the report.
This is a position that we reject.
I support this change.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Does China respect human rights?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The plenary has spoken.
(4)
You said so yourself, Commissioner.
Aids are in the process of changing.
But what can we do about it?
But for how long?
That is the most important of it.
What is to be done?
Who will pay?
From which budget?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I enjoyed that.
Georgia is also beset by troubles.
This has to stop.
This really has to stop.
This is what is at stake.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Innocent people too are at risk.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The honourable Members know the rules.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank, you, Commissioner.
Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!

Does the House agree?

This seems to be a mediaeval situation.
Sport and friendship go hand in hand.
I do not think he will find anything.
That is likely to bankrupt many boats.
We will not have a debate now.
Mr Prodi did not deny those comments.
¬†¬† The request is noted.
Mr Gorostiaga, this is not a debate.
¬†¬† .

Where are we now?
No airline is immune from accidents.
The first question concerns States.
How are the SAFA programmes applied?
It is very useful to listen to them.
I will certainly come and listen.
Why could that not become EU law?
This reminds me of safety in shipping.
We must now do the same for aircraft.
Let us be careful.
I agree with what she has said.
Perhaps we can do something about that.
I think we can do things better.
¬†¬† .
Thank you, Mr President.



¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .

That is a perplexing situation.
Firstly, it includes passenger ships.




We can do something about them.
A year has now passed.
We must be careful about this.
It was frustrating on occasions.
Ships must also be built more robustly.
This is no coincidence.
Europe must act.
How will the Commission react to this?
In for a penny, in for a pound.
I do not know how we would have coped.
I can assure you they do not need that.
Today, let us be clear.
That would be unacceptable.
Once again.
This directive must be applied.

This is something of a distraction.
They improve the text of the Directive.
It is therefore a crucial issue.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I never said so.
That is something different.
We have to maintain our commitments.
That is something quite different.
The objective must be pursued.
I put this forward and stand by it.
I think it is entirely reasonable.
We have to move forward on that basis.
It was right to insist on that.
Think again, Commissioner.
That is vitally important.
I am glad that has been tackled.
I hope that will be forthcoming.
I wish to comment on two things.
The first concerns waste.
It is public and easily accessible.
We are all entitled to our opinions.
I think your look suits you very well.
I did not trust you at that time.
Today we know that you fooled us.
It is just too bad.
Such is life.
Allow me to pose a further question.
All this actually means a great deal.
That attitude beggars belief.
Nonetheless, cut-off dates will be set.
Quite the opposite is the case.
This is not a permanent facility.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
That, in any case, is my own feeling.
After that, we shall conclude.
Would the Commissioner agree to that?
¬†¬† Your minute is up, Mrs¬†Ahern.
The debate is closed.
Romania recently applied for a loan.
Our proposal is as follows.
That is not acceptable.
I think that is right.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(1)
Let us not fall short of those ideals.
In this case it is necessary, however.
¬†¬† .

How did we first get on to this topic?
My group cannot accept it.
We must defend those rights.
That is something we cannot live with.
I am a little unsure.
Numerous paragraphs are contradictory.
Support from public funds is required.
All these things have to be said.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
We must root out sluggish bureaucracy.
That was a tragedy.
The second principle is supervision.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
You received that communication.
It is clear.
That is the good news!
The same goes for the G90.
They want social power.
Now is the right time to do that.
My first relates to agriculture.
That is my first point.
Obviously I am thinking of water.
After all, a great deal is at stake.
This is not the case, as we see.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Prevention is better than cure.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
We do not know who will be.
Where do we really think it is?
The Singapore issues?
I think not.
Agriculture?
You see, where is our pain barrier?

Where do we go from our new position?
How right he is.
They are the backbone of their future.
Not at all.
We reformed.
That is the way forward.



¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
This results in overexploitation.
Resources are obviously required.
¬†¬† .
National ownership is very important.
It is insufficiently precise.
However, we can do more here in Europe.
We had our own inquiry.
We should respect that.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We cannot accept that.
I do not think so.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
¬†¬† .
He will have to do so at 9 p.m.
Thank you very much.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you, Mr¬†Varela.
This brings me to market issues.
What way is this to organise diaries?
I thoroughly endorse that analysis.
This is no way to organise business.
This is therefore an important issue.
The debate is therefore closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is not justified by any legal basis.
I suggest we take a look at this.
This is a very good opportunity.
That is rather a different matter.
I am still not satisfied, however.
It is also a matter for Member States.
Fluoride can occur naturally.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
In Spain the situation has not changed.
I will then write to him in due course.
¬†¬† .
This will not be its top priority.
¬†¬† .
There is no development without peace.
So there are still outstanding issues.
¬†¬† .
It is long overdue.
¬†¬† .







I am dying'.
If not, why not?
What about Japan and others?
I know the Commissioner is committed.





He has to get tough.




















(1)
This is Ireland‚Äôs sixth presidency.
There is important work to be done.
We must be prepared for the future.
We have achieved a great deal already.
Six months is not a long time.
Our agenda is demanding and complex.
That is the priority.
Everyone needs to move into action now.
It is inherently wrong.
How would a core group work?
How would a two-speed Europe work?
It is a question of principle.
Let me underline everything you said.
We should tell our American friends so.
The same holds true for Chechnya.
That is exactly what we need.
Our group will stand alongside you.
We wish you every success.
There are no majorities here.
December's tempers have cooled.
What has happened so far?
This must change.
This must change.
This must change.
To be honest, we are doing very little.
This must change.
And yes, I will tell Mr Fischer so.
Either
That is something I would like to see.
it is criminal.
We have to tell them so.
Then we need to talk straight to Iran.
We have to tell Iran that.
Equality all round!
We all have to acknowledge the fact.
Thank you.
That is the reality.
Let it come down to a test, however.
We in Northern Ireland have problems.
It is time we acted.
We expect the EU to protest.
It is time to stop pretending.
We are far from reaching that point.
They need growth; they need jobs.
Mr Cohn-Bendit mocked your comments.
Obviously, we share that view.
Now we are told it is insufficient.
Be careful, Mr President-in-Office!
Enlargement is challenge of the decade.
It is a dynamic process after all.
Allow me to make a further comment.
Major epidemics are a case in point.
That is what this Parliament voted for.
That is all very well.
They want to run their own affairs.
It is multilateral solutions we need.
There are too many stakeholders.
Good luck, we are right behind you!
We are not saying that.
We shall do our best to implement it.
I shall say a final few words.
I will do all I can to finalise it.
We need the help of Parliament.
The facts are simple.
Unfortunately, this is true.
We need a joint effort.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† I will do that.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† .
The Rules of Procedure allow for this.
¬†¬† .
Bono will be pleased.
You have voted only on the first part.
I would like you to vote on Part 2 now.
We have voted on 36.
¬†¬† .
Well, life is like that!
That is how it is?
Do you not have anything else to say?
Well, you should!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That concludes the vote.
We abstained.
¬†¬† .
It is a modern form of colonialism.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We abstained on this report.
¬†¬† .
We therefore voted against this report.
I do not wish to take such a risk.
¬†¬† .
And it wants to speed things up.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is deplorable.
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted against.
(1)
This list is by no means exhaustive.
All eyes turn now to Ireland.
The first is the death penalty.
¬†¬† .
We have some amazing statistics.
It is a vital issue.
¬†¬† .
Everybody who wants to come?
I think that is impossible.
It makes practical suggestions.
This is not an immediate process.
This cannot happen all at once.
I recognise the need for this.
All the rest follows from this.
There is extensive mistrust.
I can speak from my own experience.
We are now in another position.
Immigration policy is something else.
Thank you.
That is how US power was built.

Who contributes the ideas?
Are the national parliaments consulted?
That is not true.
Anyone who wants that should say so.
That would need a Treaty amendment.

Firstly, managing migratory flows.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mrs Sartori.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I thank the honourable Member.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I accept that.

Opinions differ, naturally.
¬†¬† My position has been traduced.
I am not saying that I am the expert.
Let us protect our people.
¬†¬† .
That is what our Constitution says.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The first concerns only comitology.
¬†¬† .
That is the key issue.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Discussions are ongoing.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I thank the Member for that.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Who do they report to?
Do they report to Europol in The Hague?
Is there somebody in charge?
How is it organised?
Who is in charge?
Who liaises with whom?
This is a new departure.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This issue was raised at that stage.
¬†¬† .
Good luck, Sir!
¬†¬† .
I thank the Member for that.
It is a complex issue.
¬†¬† .
We are aware of that.
¬†¬† .
My reply will be very brief.
¬†¬† .
I am sorry I cannot expand on this.
On what does this report focus?
¬†¬† .
This is reinforced in points 16 and 17.
I welcome this report.
This is truly welcome.
There could be very practical problems.
This ambivalence cannot continue.
This is the wrong direction to take.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I want to emphasise that.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
¬†¬† .
That is what makes it regrettable.
We do not believe that to be the case.
Why is it so important?
There have been two important periods.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
The answer is clearly 'no'.
We are still awaiting a response.
Well, we are still waiting.
¬†¬† .
Mr Hughes asked for a timetable.
We know that this is a major problem.
Why may we do so?
This is an opportunity to do just that.
It must be respected and protected‚Äô.

Are we certain of that?
¬†¬† .
I would thus like to thank the Members.
It is not an easy issue at all.
I thank Parliament.
The debate is closed.
(1)
(1)
We had a mass of amendments to vote on.
¬†¬† .
That should not happen.
We were unable to agree to that.
This was adopted unanimously.
We are grateful to them.
That is premature.
The horizontal approach is a good one.
I beg to differ.
They should also be clarified.
We need to develop a common platform.
I agree with that.


The activities are no different.
¬†¬† .
The main problem is one of procedure.
¬†¬† .
That should be clarified.
This will be a welcome advance.
I turn to the report by Mr Purvis.
He believes in the market.
The legal base is an important point.
That is very regrettable.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
(1)
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This text is far from satisfactory.
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It must be respected and protected‚Äô.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Subsidiarity must apply.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted against.
This is long overdue.
This, again, is long overdue.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This explains our vote.
¬†¬† .
What hypocrisy!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I am very concerned.
Explanations of vote are closed.
(2)
That was good, correct and important.
So far, so good.
Thank you in advance.
As I said, it was a long process.
¬†¬† .
Something needs to be done here.
So this is a very timely report.

It is a proposal I await eagerly.
Quite the reverse.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Mugabe must go.
What destroyed Zimbabwe?
That would be too much.
That is what this issue is about.
Despite intimidation, people voted.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The peace process is very fragile.
We have lost a true friend.

We should honour his memory.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
I could go on in this vein for hours.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
(1)
110 amendments had to be rejected:
That is what I have done.
We thank you for being here.
¬†¬† .
We may, or may not, succeed.
¬†¬† .

Let me now mention a final point.
Let me conclude with words of hope.
... that is a misuse of the colour.
Well, on behalf of 80%, I admit.
I believe that would be a good start.
Why?
That is an important point.
We need referenda.
Referenda are people‚Äôs democracy.
It is not possible!
They are not a secret.
That is essential.
We reject this idea for two reasons.
That would cause a stir.
Why is there this level of consensus?
How?
A Norwegian, please note.
We say ‚ÄòRIP‚Äô.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow.
Our approach has been clear all along.
Unfortunately that is not possible.
We could then, perhaps, make progress.
That concludes the item.
¬†¬† .
Now, no such services can be provided.
¬†¬† .
I totally agree with Mr Karas.

That is your expression.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow.
Such bans are misguided.
and

¬†¬† .



This is at best a start.
I have met the operators.
Anything else would be irresponsible.
Our efforts must not stop here.

The result is satisfactory.

¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
That is something I cannot but welcome.
I believe this must continue.


I think we must be very careful here.
¬†¬† .
The issue of China and human rights.


¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
and
Thank you, all who have contributed.
This is quite remarkable.




That is what I myself am going to do.
I would now like to move forward.
They now have to work in practice.
But why is this?
Environmental issues are central.
The vote will be tomorrow at 10.30 a.m.
The third point relates to the report.
We have set some very tough targets.
I commend this package to the House.
Such alternatives do exist now.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
This was not what we had asked for.
The criticism is too serious.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr B√∂sch.
The debate is closed.
That is a clear alternative.
Well, that is wonderful, I must say.
That was no small matter.
Mr¬†Casaca‚Äôs report is not bad.
That is regrettable, in my view.
How do you see this working?
Action is needed.
I say this in all clarity.
We need clear priorities for OLAF.
I say that in all clarity as well.
We need priorities.
They have to shoulder this.
The debate is closed.
Personally, I am glad about it.
The first point is about the budget.
The third point concerns enlargement.
My final point is about US strategy.
But it does not serve anyone else.
It requires in-depth analysis.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner Busquin.
The debate is closed.
- thirdly: bilateral trade agreements.
That is the future for our industry.
This has become increasingly vital.
The debate is closed.
Is there nothing more pressing?
No, that is not the reason.
¬†¬† .

It is not enough, however.
We will all then be the losers.
For fear of double vetoes, no doubt?
We cannot, therefore, support it.
We need to reform the Security Council.
Excellent!
I shall concentrate on four points.
This must be pursued in a UN context.
¬†¬† .
Today‚Äôs debate is timely.
¬†¬† We shall now proceed to the vote.
(1)
That is why I voted against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
All of us want a strong United Nations.
This is irresponsible.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our abstention from the vote.
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is something I naturally welcome.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
That is why I voted against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is why I voted against.
It is completely unacceptable.
Elections are the beginning of wisdom.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is why I do not support it.
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted against.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.(2)
You honour us with your presence today.
They are with us in the Chamber now.
That movement is not going to stop.
Most immigrants are not refugees.
The challenge of integration is real.
Integration is a two-way street.
Yes, they may gain remittances.
They do not want a free ride.
They want a fair opportunity.
They are not criminals or terrorists.
They are law-abiding.
They do not want to live apart.
... is not applied to people.
For all of this, we thank you.
You were right to do so.
Well, it is not too late to do so.
Or is it?
(1)
That is the answer to your question.
Her name is Yamha Mohammed.
I do not have a list in front of me.
¬†¬† .
We must be realistic.
What is this actually about?
What role should redistribution have?
They are European initiatives.
¬†¬† .
Members discussed many questions.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
My proposals are also clear.
It is a horrendous precedent.
¬†¬† .
The fourth point concerns 'opting out'.
There are various types of approach.
But this was unusual.
We should not be discussing pay.
Do we want a minimum regime?
Let me give you one example.
That is certainly going a long way.
They have to take what is on offer.
So much for matters being voluntary.
That is a personal experience.
Good.
That is the first point.
Why stop here?
No, I do not want a Europe like that.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at noon on Wednesday.

¬†¬† .
I should like to mention three points.
We are not that far yet.
Question time has also improved.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
and
¬†¬† .
Such corruption takes various forms.
Secondly, there is social policy.
People must be able to expect it.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(1)
(1)
I would like to make three points.
He briefly mentioned that.
Oh really?
I will come to that in a moment.
We are always -acting.
That is a mistake.
Let us protect them!
Have we done enough research?
Is this true or not?
Finally, a word about the OIE.
Thank you very much.
The first concerns the health aspect.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you, Mr President.
Let me pick up Mr Mulder‚Äôs example.
Is this a risk to our consumers?
Why is this so, Commissioner?
This seems to be a loophole.
My next question is as follows.
What do we do with those countries?
What do the consumers want?
This is a very worrying aspect.
There is cause for grave concern.
Can we totally guarantee their safety?
Mr Nicholson mentioned feathers.
What can be done to counter it?
Use vaccines?
How effective are they?
¬†¬† .
But I had also been in Thailand.
He asked me about coordinating groups.
Mr de Roo asked me about borders.
I have already answered that question.
This is a Member State competence.
I believe that to be the case.
This matter is under review.
They are being financed.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
That is sensible.
I commend this measure to the House.
I have hope, and that is everything.
Thank you.
Such is the case this time too.
I am still awaiting a reply.
We should be proud of ourselves today.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
It must become so in reality again.
That is not on.
I thank you.
It would have been very useful for us.
That has been decided upon.
This is an area I am concerned about.
That is something I do not want.
Its starting point is beyond dispute.
This is out of all proportion.
Of course, there is a reason for this.
Protection remains necessary.
And strong regions mean strong farmers.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you.
Your comment will be passed on.
¬†¬† Thank you Mrs Lulling.
(1)
This word replaces 'authority'.
The rest remains unchanged.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Very well, Mr¬†Katiforis.
In any case, I shall be brief.
I voted in favour, of course.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is time for us to act swiftly.
Hence my vote in favour.
I am therefore voting in favour.
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
And:
This explains our vote.
Fatuzzo, you know Mr¬†Mennea.
¬†¬† .
This assumption is short-sighted.
This ought to be a national concern.
There are therefore two crucial issues:
¬†¬† That concludes the voting.
(1)
Farmers have a right to decent incomes.
What are the possible solutions?
We must compare like with like.
The debate is closed.


¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Hyland.
The debate is closed.
Thank you.

Something has to be done.
We all support sustainable fishing.
That is something we should appreciate.
We really do need these measures.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.



Why is this the case?

We need that flexibility in the budget.
I think it shows a lack of ambition.
Farewell cohesion!
Farewell solidarity!
My group welcomes this.
One proposal meets with our approval.
That cannot be the right approach.
Both of these approaches are wrong.
Here is what we have to do.
We will be looking at them.
So is a high-level infrastructure.
Finally, just a few round figures.
These are just two minor examples.
The second doubt concerns the timing.
So then, why the urgency?
¬†¬† .

These, I repeat, are radical changes.
The timeframes are extremely long.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Nothing of the sort!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
But there is real confusion.
¬†¬† .
Thank you.
¬†¬† .
You can only set a lead.
One concerns the Lisbon Strategy.
This is a very important matter.
You said that you would conduct them.
When do you intend to conduct them?
That is my answer to the question.
What will we do in that case?
Legally, that is as much as I can say.
I am obliged to tell you this.
¬†¬† .


It was very helpful and supportive.
¬†¬† .
Thank you.
¬†¬† .
That is the first answer.
We cannot go on like this.
But the first issue has been solved.
This review is not yet complete.
That is what we have done.
¬†¬† . Mr Posselt, I apologise.
They are.
That, however, has not had much effect.
He agreed to do so.
These are not very helpful.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.

The Terni situation is symptomatic.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
The vote will be on Thursday.
Will they grasp the challenge?
¬†¬† .
We have three categories of action.
You are Greek, Commissioner.
Do you know what is happening?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
(1)
¬†¬† .
It was approved in the 1980s.
The number was reduced to 160 in 2003.

Colombia is a social democracy.
Terrorism has increased poverty.


We believe in social capitalism.
It is time to destroy drugs.
They yearn for alternatives.
¬†¬† .
It will require investment.
You have our support on this.
That cannot be the way to go.
Let me remind you what he said.
What can be done about it?
How, though?
Not one word!
Yes, but about what?








No delays should be countenanced.
A convincing response must be provided.
You bet!
What, then, is the cure?
You have both referred to Tampere.
I refer to the fight against terrorism.
I trust my suggestion will be taken up.
Allow me to mention a few examples.
Europe is a common venture.
Further, 1¬†May is fast approaching.
There are, of course, many problems.
We cannot ignore 11¬†September 2001.
¬†¬† .
This is one of the problems.
We must act to achieve these outcomes.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is not at all.
My last remark is about the budget.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Iraq appeared not to have them.
This must be the goal of all of us.
¬†¬† .
Since then, nothing has happened.
The EU countries are not much better.
This is in the public interest.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The joint debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
What state has my amendment ‚Ä¶
I will deal with it.
Now we come to the procedural question.
That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† Thank you Mr Fatuzzo.
We therefore abstained.
I voted in favour.
I therefore voted in favour.
Let us hope that it happens soon!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The complaints are set to persist.
I voted in favour.
This raises four important issues:
¬†¬† .
However, I dispute your point.
Great Britain is the leader here.
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
(1)
¬†¬† .
But it must be a viable state.
The ambulance arrived much later.
Even the shops are on the other side.
Help us!‚Äô
That can be legally established.

What did we do?
I think it is shameful.
What does that really mean?
I do not share this view.
This is a hugely wasted opportunity.
I wish to think well of both sides.
Do not forget that.
I think not.
He does not recognise the Green Line.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì We are obliged to the Council.
The debate is closed.
Many sensible investors will pull out.
So this matters to all of us.
Such arrangements are untenable.
This is no isolated case, however.
Nothing less.
They see they have been duped.
They were already forbidden.
Unfortunately, they were all false.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
That is a matter of taste.
We should recognise that.
I agree.
That is a very relevant question.
However, we can make it harder.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
¬†¬† .
I take the point made by the Member.
We are very concerned about that.


¬†¬† .
I am aware of this case.
That is very welcome.
¬†¬† .







¬†¬† Question No 7 has been withdrawn.








¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you Mr¬†President.
¬†¬† .
That is the issue.


We are reliant on the industry here.
((1)
¬†¬† .
What is the situation today?
We wanted 20%.
We must not allow this to happen.
We shall have to make do with that.
I shall hand it to you later on.
We must support them in this fight.
The same goes for the warlords.
Their effect is devastating.
It spreads indecency and vulgarity.
The first concerns drugs.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
It was warmly welcomed by the Council.

May I make a final comment?
Do you realise that or do you not?
How is such a thing possible?
Much remains to be done, however.
We note that it was published in 2003.
We welcome that.
This debate will continue.
We are far from it.
Why is it important, Commissioner?
Good accounts make good friends.
Our message must be clear.
We welcome the United States' interest.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† We shall now proceed to the vote.
(1)
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
The Taliban regime was appalling.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the voting.
¬†¬† The sitting is resumed.
Are there any comments?
So here are my questions.
¬†¬† .
So much the better!
I cannot conceive of any other reasons.
This is the legal clarity we want.
You talked about confusion.
Where is the confusion?
That is the content.
You talk about exemptions.
So much for making things more certain.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Herzog.
The debate is closed.
It is a legitimate question.
That is right, but only in part.
He has other responsibilities as well.
That is never the case.
What on earth does it have to hide?
Yes or no?
What does it have to hide?
I fail to understand that.
The Commission has met its obligations.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
I think that this is spot on.
President Khatami will not resign.
¬†¬† .
Why?
I will come back to that later.
Why are they trying to do that?
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
I strongly condemn that assassination.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Patten.
The joint debate is closed.
This is a terrible situation.
Shortly?
That will have to be verified.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
(1)
May I request that correction.
(2)
(3)
¬†¬† I take note of that suggestion.
That, then, is what I would call for.
¬†¬† That is a very good point.
This is what we are trying to do.
These, therefore, are our objectives.
The first is to guarantee continuity.
These are the priorities we propose.

Those are just a few examples.
We need to restore growth.
We need enlargement to be successful.
We all hope and expect it will be.
The same situation applies to Iraq.
That concludes the debate.
We oppose this project.
and
The prize is a great one.
This is certainly a positive sign.
They can all be found in our report.
Much remains to be done in this regard.
But what is actually happening?
Can we stop now?
I do not think so.
The same is true of trainees.
The Commissioner mentioned this.
This is absolutely crucial.
Opinions have changed.
Another important aspect is involved.
Europe is stuck in second gear.
We must not let the recovery fool us.
We know what needs doing.
I am not so sure.
Nothing has happened.


The zeal of the convert, no doubt.
How does Europe respond?
But where is the cash?
That is the last thing Europe needs.
It is no solution.
And why not?
But that is not all.
Every day we add new rigidity.
Fine!
And who will be footing the bill?
Unfortunately this is not possible.
I should like to present one example.
I see that as utterly false.
Productivity ties everything together.
I believe this diagnosis remains valid.
I maintained this was not the case.
I have one last remark to make.
I feel the starting point is sound.
¬†¬† .
That was a very interesting point.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
And we must all work towards this goal.
What message are we sending out here?
In the world of sport there are teams.
In the real world there are laws.
In the world of sport we have referees.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Europarty support blurs democracy.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
No, there must be some difference!
I do not think so, Mr¬†President.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.

¬†¬† The debate is closed.
This is a complicated matter.
That is also an important victory.
It is not a permanent exemption.
Time will, of course, tell, however.
We believed they were too high.
And I frankly do not believe in this.
The first is the legal basis.
I wish again to thank the rapporteur.
I am very pleased.
An empty annex is of no interest to us.
Ireland has yet to ratify.

¬†¬† The debate is closed.
I can see two other Members arriving!
It therefore had to be temporary.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
(1)
¬†¬† .
Why?
We have to do something about that.
The war has become self-perpetuating.
That sounds all well and good.
Russia has huge environmental problems.
Our policy on Russia has failed badly.
This situation has to be rectified.
But which Russia?
I have a question for Mr Patten.
We all know why.
What happened in Rwanda was genocide.
We see other things.
These conditions have been met.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.

¬†¬† We now continue with the vote.


That concludes the vote.
- Report: Daul (A5-0082/2004)

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .









I accordingly voted in favour.


I am going to be a bit naughty here.
Nothing has been done.
Are there any comments?
(1)
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you Mr President.
It makes sense to hold over the vote.
The report was sent to that committee.
If it has, I will not try to interpose.
This is an extremely serious matter.
It is totally unacceptable.
and
What are we celebrating?
Women's rights are human rights.
We still have a long way to go.
We were both there.
May I sit down, Mr President?
So please take a seat, Mrs Wallstr√∂m.
I will try to continue sitting down.
The second factor is working hours.





What is a family?
That, too, has to be defined.
They should be welcomed.
I believe it is necessary.
I see this as resorting to clich√©s.
There is simply more to be done.
Paragraph 16 is crucial to our group.
That is scandalous beyond belief.
There is no question about that.
I should like to ask you a question.
The same thing must happen in the EU.
There are two main reasons for this.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
I could give many other comparisons.
Finland‚Äôs? Sweden‚Äôs?
This gives us grounds for hope.
¬†¬† .
We must coordinate our efforts.
First, a few facts.
This is the concept that I suggest.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Here are just the most important.
This common position may not be ideal.
There are aspects that are not perfect.
It considerably simplifies matters.
But we still face problems.
For us this too is problematic.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
It is very important.
However, it is a very complex area.
I wonder what Mr¬†Evans really meant.
That is unacceptable.
Swedish legislation prohibits drug use.
It would amount to giving up.
The facts are inescapable.
Their citizens deserve it.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Coelho.
The debate is closed.
Why is this so?
This is severely disappointing.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
We think they are important.
These are points I take very seriously.
Who decides that?
That is not the case.
I welcome this proposal.
It should be generally welcomed.
¬†¬† Thank you for your comment.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Dehousse.
The debate is closed.
One such aspect is its scope.
Mrs¬†Paulsen mentioned labelling.
Those who tinker lose customers.
The institutions have come together.
She deserves all our thanks.
That is all we want.
¬†¬† . Mr President.
¬†¬† Thank you Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
Time will not improve this text.
Time is of the essence.
The discussions took three months.
¬†¬† .
I will explain.
Why was there this disparity?
Far from a bargain.
Nor is it a panacea for rights holders.

The law has no criminal provisions.
There are no double damages.
Why so?
I shall take toys as an example.
I have seen toys that contain cadmium.
Medicinal products are another example.
This is my first point on consumers.
They may be right.
I am of course talking about artists.
So much for the form.
We need a good directive.
Why all this?
A final comment on Article 16.
A balance has not been struck.
Let there be no confusion.
Parliament‚Äôs honour is at stake.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
We are looking at outcomes.
That is my suggestion.
Anything else would be absurd.
It seems not.
Those against please?
Are there any abstentions?
Let us consider the rules of origin.
This would be unacceptable.
Will the Commission undertake to do so?
My conclusion is a general one.
That is not where the problem lies.
The figure is definitely under 5%.
The Israelis seem ready to accept this.
What will this lead to?
So then, let us avoid this.
It is destroying lives and livelihoods.
No answer came at that time.
Why ruin them?
The EU's position is clear.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.(1)
¬†¬† .
I find this outrageous.
¬†¬† .
This is voting time, not a debate!
¬†¬† I take note of that.
That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
All this shows that this is illegal.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted against.
¬†¬† .
A number of votes were taken en bloc.
Mr Corbett, am I right on this point?
But that is not what happened.
¬†¬† .
This situation must be stopped.
¬†¬† .
The battle is far from being won.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr¬†Turmes.
I will then be guided by its wisdom.
This is a problem that we must address.
¬†¬† .
This, however, is the theory.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We say no.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against the report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
There are a variety of solutions.
¬†¬† .
There is still a need for ...
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Are there any comments?
¬†¬† That will be corrected.(1)
The detainees are in a legal vacuum.
That is the situation of the prisoners.
I would even go one step further.
¬†¬† .
In short, there is a legal void.
We are committed to human rights.
They have the right to a fair trial.
They are the opposite.
What of their families?
What of their concerns?
What of their human rights?
Mr Camre, I cannot agree with you.
Hence the actions that have been taken.
This is a historic challenge.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
It is, in any case, striking.
This process is jerking along.
It is not easy.
I urge you to leave it at that.
This is, however, necessary.
So this is the right way to go.
Cooperation is good in all areas.
What, then, is at issue here?
The answer to it is ‚Äòyes‚Äô.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner Verheugen.
I will be voting in favour.
The debate is closed.
It is refusing to do so.
What is a good teacher?
Let me just make three key points.
It cannot be any other way.
Europe has a soul.
I said there were two programmes.
The first field is the Youth Programme.
The second field is culture.
Upstream by acquiring competences.
Our cinema schools must be networked.
That would be a very good thing.
It is of course a framework.
What are the facts of the matter here?
It is not clear to me from the text.
Please accept my apologies.
Over what period? On what basis?
What news!
My second question concerns languages.
My third question concerns the cinema.
You spoke about Bruges and Florence.
Let me now turn to the new programme.
That must not be allowed to happen.
We need to be very clear.
That is clear.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Two big obstacles lie ahead of you.

That much is abundantly clear.
That is the problem facing us.
That is what we have to reckon with.
¬†¬† .
It is horrific!
We should have got past this stage.
It is ridiculous.
There should be a ban on them.
It is not acceptable.
We should get our priorities right.
Let people in, not these trophies.
This is the basic requirement.
That is a technical assessment.
But I do not see that as a solution.
This is a noble pursuit, in my view.
The risk to health is obvious.
Take for example nickel.
I would urge him to think again.
This is a real problem in my country.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you, Mrs Wallstr√∂m.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Fischler.
Follow their example, Commissioner!
I shall return to this point later.
Mr¬†Berlato mentioned them earlier.
¬†¬† .
There is no link, though.
That much is clear.
This will fuel speculation.
Why should it be abandoned?
I trust the House will support them.
Advisedly, it must inform and prohibit.
To South-East Asia?
Such data is now available.
I shall focus on olive oil.
Olive oil production is no exception.
This is an unacceptable position.
That is a difference of almost 500%.
There is another paradox involved too.
The situation beggars belief.
We believe the situation has to change.
They would all have to be scrapped.
It is a problem.
¬†¬† .
And so to cotton.
That is the issue here.
Let me turn, finally, to hops.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
Minister Roche's report is clear.
That work must not be in vain.
For an enlarged Europe, Nice death.
How far have we got?

Those are the words of the Commission.
That is their one and only goal.
Five months!
Is the Presidency fully informed?
What issues?
Raised by whom?
By how many and which governments?
We do not know.
We can only try to guess at these.
There has been no further news of them.
What does the Commission stand for?
I can only recommend vigilance.
What do they ask us about?
What does it do?
How is it run and by whom?
I could name many other directives too.
New magic remedies are not required.
I shall begin with the Lisbon Strategy.
He is right.
Again, they are right.
That is a very significant poll.
Mr Brok was also correct.
That is true.
I would reiterate that point.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
and
¬†¬† .
The turnaround is truly remarkable.
My report is therefore very optimistic.
Confidence is a key factor.
And we have also guaranteed this'.
The situation has changed, however.
This is not so.
The European people have the final say.
The Union as a whole stands to benefit.
There is still time.
We had to do it.
We are making preparations.
This difference is crucial.
It is an occasion for joy.
I believe we will do it, however.
One final remark.
I will not go into that now.
The two things are closely related.
We completely condemn these articles.
Together we can strengthen Europe.
That is something I deeply regret.
Another problem is Cyprus.
¬†¬† The debate is suspended.
It will continue at 3 p.m.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

I therefore voted in favour.

I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
To be specific:
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I naturally welcome these amendments.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .‚Äì I am voting for this report.

(1)
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
That is not its purpose, however.
That was not my aim.
¬†¬† .
The two months left are little time.
What do we need to do?
We need to support this effort.
It is true that we have to accept that.
¬†¬† .
Needless to say, that is not the case.
We need a policy for all the countries.
¬†¬† .
They are far from achieving this.
I would like to highlight two issues.
But problems remain.
All this is by way of general comment.
That really is an old way of thinking.

I think that is happening.
At best, this is tabloid hysteria.
That is hardly a flood!
¬†¬† That concludes the joint debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
This is not correct.
The reality is in fact the opposite.
¬†¬† .
I commend this report to the House.
Codecision is at issue here.
Both sides have to give way.
We cannot find a solution.
A whole railway would be required.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
It is not on the agenda.
You say they are not sanctions.
I would like to find another word.
They are happening on a daily basis.
Action is indeed needed.
It is not, as the Member well knows.
They are very welcome measures.
Whether we like it or not, it is true.
It is adopting a holistic approach.
We are taking a holistic approach.
I agree with Mr Evans.
My question relates to the following.
Separating people never works.
I thank the Member for the question.
I have followed the Rules of Procedure.
¬†¬† They belong to different groups.
¬†¬† I am sorry, Mr Beazley.
¬†¬† .
That has not happened.
He is correct in that.
The Irish Government welcomes that.
The Breton language exists in Brittany.
(2)
and
¬†¬† .
State aircraft have been exempted.
We can then go forward into the future.
I would add one word of caution.
I look forward to the future.
This is now a very good report.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
These are the good bits in this report.
That is where this report goes wrong.
What does it mean by structural reform?
That is not what I am about.
I have looked at this report.
This is not what Europe is about.
We have talked about the Lisbon agenda.
That never gets mentioned these days.
Instead, it is market, market, market.
Europe has a soul.
We cannot let down our citizens.
I am here wearing two hats.
Thank you for this report.
¬†¬† .
There is much more to come!
Railtrack by sea!
I hope Sir Neil would agree to that.
Further market opening is desirable.
He is very wise!
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
Just four topics.
For whom?
They need different rules.
I should like to emphasise this.
The industry approves.
Rather, the opposite is the case.
They are the big losers.
We want to defend consumers.
They are taxable in all other cases.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.

That is certainly not the intention.
We have great reservations.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon tomorrow.
I commend the report to you.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon tomorrow.
(1)
No more bombs.
No more deaths.
¬†¬† .
Madam President, thank you very much.

What is the meaning of this updating?
That is not part of this discussion.
The key date will be 1¬†May 2004.
That is extremely depressing.
I believe that this can be avoided.
On the contrary.
No one will be discriminated against.
That is my personal view.
¬†¬† .
It is a real problem.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you, Mrs¬†Lynne.
Things can get worse still.
This is food for thought.
I am really looking forward to this.
It is a very comprehensive report.
That is something I do not deny.
Hence the proposals that we tabled.

¬†¬† .
I would like to make just two comments.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Let us have the names out in the open.
There will be a full enquiry.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† We now continue with the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† I am sorry, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
(1)
We can reflect and work on it later on.
We have plenty of time.
It is only a recommendation.
Paragraph 33 is poor.
That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
I take it that you are not very happy.
This is just one more ‚Ä¶
I voted for it.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted for the report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The damage, though, has been done.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I disagree with them very strongly.
¬†¬† .
I shall therefore vote in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This was in 1997 and 1998.
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I shall therefore vote in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Sovereignty must be safeguarded.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr¬†Ford.
¬†¬† .
Now it has imploded again.
What can be done?
We need to do all these things.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .




(1)
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you, Mrs Banotti.(1)
I deplore this decision by our House.
¬†¬† ‚Äì I can do that.
and

That is clear.
They need to change what is going on.

This appears unlikely.
I believe that this is a mistake.
Congratulations to Mr Skinner!
I think it would be utterly impossible.
Mrs van den Berg mentioned two points.
A reasonable compromise has been found.
The joint debate is closed.
After all, what is happening?
Credible interlocutors deliver results.
That is the first choice.
But what shall we do?
Shall we go back to the beginning?
Shall we wait another year?
Let us be realistic.
How could he get justice?
What happens to them?
So we shall support the report.
You have not dealt with this.
I agree with everything she said.
I do not believe that is justified.
This is not the way to fight terrorism.
Civil liberties have to be upheld.
They do not work.
Failing that, I appeal for more calm.
That is perfectly true.
Mr Pirker also remarked on that.
The debate is closed.
An explanation really is needed.
Export refunds should be abolished.
What was their final destination?
I will reiterate that point.
That was our mistake in the past.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† Commissioner Dimas has the floor.
Finally, I wish to say a big thank you.
I am convinced it will be.
I commend this report to the House.
There is no doubt about that.
¬†¬† Thank you very much Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The debate is closed.
You have this proposal before you.
This is all too true.
That has not always been the case.
I refer to Amendments Nos 9 and 13.
I refer to Amendments Nos 38 and 39.
The debate is closed.
(1)
(1)
¬†¬† .
These new agreements are ambitious.
¬†¬† .





¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
Two very different approaches.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
What is it all about?
I believe they do.
There are a number of reasons for this.
There remains the question of costs.
¬†¬† .
It would be practicable then.
That is not a credible working method.
How did we get into this situation?
What is it all about?
I have a different opinion personally.
It has been tough.
There is no doubt about that.
Thank you for your cooperation.
We do not want this point accepted.
I cannot support that.
We have got to protect public health.
What is it about?
The devil is in the details.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon.
¬†¬† .
Animal welfare is an emotive subject.
They can see it coming in the future.
I thank Mr Maat very much for that.
This must be stopped.
There is no question of an EU tax.
I cannot support that view.
The reality is different.
That is cruel.
I consider that unacceptable.
That is probably pie in the sky.
This is an important issue.
This is a mistaken point of departure.
That applies not only to journey times.
Let me underline a few of them.
What does ‚Äòspecial‚Äô mean?
One last thing.
However, that is no way near enough.
Refrigeration permits this.
This should stop.
The hauling of animals should stop.
What do we want?
Why increase spaces?
In order to increase costs?
Whom does this benefit?
What is the justification?
No, it is not.
I believe that needs to be said.
If it is not, then it will not work.
Nine hours is about right.
That is the reality of this.


I want to thank Mrs Schierhuber.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
Does anyone wish to speak against it?
‚Äì That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We must, however, go further.
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Why does this need to be emphasised?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I could only vote in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Part 3 ‚Äì any specific actions.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Of course, all that smacks of fraud.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
(2)
We are not strangers to each other.
It is despicable and it is cowardly.
And what are the circumstances?
That is true.
We need no more initiatives.
It was contrary to international law.
Walls can never be the solution.
He would crush them in a sandwich.
That is what is so terrible.
Why not back our words with action?
Why all these words? Why no action?
Why is action not taken against Israel?
Politically, we do nothing, however.
This debate is outdated.
We do that with Israel.
It is a democracy.
Will we simply let this happen?
¬†¬† Mr President, I have two points.
Do we mourn this man?
Finally, what does this plan advocate?
The fight against terrorism?
Resolution of the conflict?
Lastly, democratic reforms?
Civil society must be involved.
My question is, what can do?
Is that really all we can manage to do?

Where is the balance?
What are we doing now?
Politics are not neutral.
No terrorist acts can be approved.
It must be condemned.
The EU must not accept this.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
There was precious little sign of it.
There was one exception to this.
That would be completely unacceptable.
What are the priorities now?
That is completely unacceptable.
It is clear who was behind it.
Everything is now in ruins.
We need to think about that.
I still do not see that happening.
Let us remind ourselves.
We must change policy.
Four thousand people are still missing.
Traumas from the present as well.
We must aim for both and status.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.

¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
The Commission supports these efforts.
I hope we succeed.
That was not, however, the case.
New developments require new standards.
A good system is sufficient.
¬†¬† .
It makes sense.
It is different in southern countries.
What do we say to future generations?
It has not done nearly enough.
That is a serious omission.
Thank you for this debate.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
(1)
The sooner it is in place, the better.
We also considered Cyprus.
This must be our answer to terrorism.
Europe is now to act!
That would make everything much easier.


That is not sustainable.
Europeans deserve better.
What do we see today instead?
They never choose a woman, mind you!
The Constitution?
A final word on Iraq.
Why now?
You have all our good wishes.

Adieu, Giscard d'Estaing.

Europe can and must act differently.
We do not need a European Patriot Act.
How true!
We are still waiting for the results.
Is the end of the blockade in sight?
Hopes for this are not unjustified.
I hope that actions will follow!
The time for hesitation is past.

The Lisbon strategy is not yet lost.
Europe is once again at the crossroads.
We cannot let them get away with this.

Is this reasonable?
We have to take heed of this.
We must not stigmatise the Arab world.
That is what I asked for last week.
I mentioned a few this morning.
I could not agree more.
That has been useful.
The points were well made.
I will take that fully into account.
Of course, we could have done nothing.
I am sure he will be very pleased.
You will have to settle this elsewhere.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at12 noon.
How decisive, however, is the Council?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We have no objections to this.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is an objective that we reject.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
For these reasons, I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
This being so, we prefer to abstain.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We are all in this fight together.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
These irregularities must be addressed.
¬†¬† .
There are indeed other examples.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
I first wish to make a general point.
Let me turn to a specific case.
Let me be quite clear here and now.
We will be led only by evidence.
(1)
¬†¬† .
Seventhly, free market economy.
That was foolish.
Are the problems already resolved?
No, they are not.
It still has a long way to go.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Volcic.
The debate is closed.
This is the fourth report.
I turn now to the right of asylum.
¬†¬† .
Victimisation is also prohibited.
¬†¬† .
I very much appreciate this statement.
The fact is that it does not.
That is truly wonderful.
Homosexuals suffer discrimination.
Muslims are being persecuted.
We expect a reply to this.
The first, inevitably, is the family.
Ladies and gentlemen, ?
Europe is open to migration.
We live in a less than perfect world.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at12 noon.
¬†¬† .
They merit some detailed consideration.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
In fact it is quite correct.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This brings us to my second point.

Not all cases are the same.
Have you read it?
Mr Coelho referred to it earlier on.
What chance is there of real progress?
¬†¬† .
It is an astonishing debate.
¬†¬† ‚ÄìThank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.(1)
¬†¬† .
Improvements have definitely been made.
That cannot be changed.
In a word, it is absurd.




¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is quite unacceptable.
Is it really effective?
What happens if the data are misused?
Let us not even think about that.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Why direct access?
I share and understand those concerns.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What in fact was the question asked?



¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Thirdly, introducing transparency.
The EDF covers five years.
How?
Everyone knows this dossier well.
¬†¬† .
This generally takes years.
There is poor parliamentary control.

¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Let me give you some examples.
The Council took up this issue.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is what we have.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We have come to the end of the agenda.
You have the floor, Mr Jarzembowski.
It also applies to the Americans.
Many thanks, Madam Vice-President.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mrs Gebhardt.
The changes we want are revolutionary.
Elements of the are non-negotiable.
There is no room for negotiation.
Let me return to the subject of Turkey.
¬†¬† .
Child labour also remains high.
I find this a valuable observation.
All these things take time.
¬†¬† .
Mrs Smet spoke about this at length.
I will mention just two points.
Turkey is in a particular situation.
We surely cannot take this seriously.
What does paragraph 7 say on this?
Surely not.
If so, in what form?
What about the structural funds?
This is a positive step.
Just as well!
That is clearly not the case.
I have four brief comments to make.
That is the truth of the matter.
That is not our idea.
In reality, it is far from it.
I cannot share the same confidence.
This was not an isolated incident.
I do not believe that we can.
I think he was right.
We would answer in the negative.
This is a very serious precedent.
Long live freedom!
Long live the European Union!
That we owe to ourselves and to them.
Can they do it?
I really am very, very grateful.
Fortunately, reality is different.
And why are we small?

Let us look at demography.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
¬†¬† We shall now proceed to the vote.
(1)
¬†¬† .
I would like to make a few points here.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is something I shall insist on.
¬†¬† .
This is my sincere hope.
This seems too long to me.
I therefore voted in favour.
I therefore voted against the report.
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is a modern form of colonialism.
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We voted against it.


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Item 28
Item 147
This is an obvious sleight of hand.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This was unfortunately not the case.
This was unfortunately not the case.
¬†¬† .

I voted in favour of this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted against the resolution.
¬†¬† .
What a charade!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
Only thus can we embrace a new future.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.(4)
(5)
It is great news for deaf-blind people.
¬†¬† .
Our position in this regard is clear.
That is heavy and demanding work.
The wording is of secondary importance.
That is the wrong road to go down.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
That is a source of concern.
A feasibility study has been launched.
Today this figure has doubled.

We are not alone in taking action.
This development will continue.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Posselt.
¬†¬† We shall proceed to the vote on:
(1)
Are there any comments?(1)
¬†¬† I agree with you, Mr¬†President.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr¬†President.
(2)
I do not wish to have that debate now.
¬†¬† .
We are alone in being able to do this.
¬†¬† .
No, this is not on.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will be on Tuesday at 12 noon.
and
¬†¬† .
Only later do you get the bill.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We would regard that as indefensible.
We agree on a great many points.
Our problem is lack of time.
We are talking about consumer rights.
We call this being ‚Äòin the red‚Äô.
¬†¬† .
Firstly, joint and several liability.
The average loan is EUR 7000.
Firstly, enforcement cooperation.
This would reduce legal certainty.
That is not our ambition.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
This proposal has several objectives.

We have tabled this amendment again.
We have tabled some amendments again.
That would be a welcome development.
This is very important.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
That is our main purpose.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
I shall be brief.
Firstly, investment incentives.
Thirdly, comitology.
¬†¬† .
So much for the background.
My second recommendation is this.
I cannot answer that question today.
I cannot emphasise this enough.
A detailed list will be provided.
This has been most important.
Good progress has been made.
We have worked well together.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
This is an innovative concept.
Why?
I urge the Commission to be ambitious.
This is a positive move.
There is big money at stake here.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
I will list nine points.
In my view, the result is sound.
Trees fall over or burn down.
This is old-fashioned dogmatism.
I disagree on this point.
I can see why.
It is not really a bad result.
Member States: we will be watching you!
This brings me to the de Roo report.
We will also have to be cost-efficient.
This will help us to do so.
First of all, Russia.
These are the arguments.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† We have noted what you say.
I support some of the amendments.
Lastly, the timescale.
I am deeply cynical about these.
It all seems ridiculous.
Why do we not do the same here?
The alternative is thus in place.
Those are our main arguments.
They must be taken care of.
The debate is closed.
I regret that.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The new rules remedy this shortcoming.
That is progress.
That too is progress.
That is progress.
However, that is not all.
I see that as being unacceptable.
There are one or two points of concern.
This is a technical and complex issue.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner Dimas.
The debate is closed.
(1)
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Today is 19¬†April.



Nothing more nor less.
The Bureau now has 67 signatures.
I am looking forward to your response.
¬†¬† .

Summer is coming.
We also have two questions to settle.
These are good guidelines.

Ideology does indeed make you blind.

Thank you, Galicians.
I thank you all.
Thank you all the same. .
Many thanks.
That is a fair objective.

This would not be very logical.
I therefore welcome the Sterckx report.
In this report, measures are proposed.
I will now comment on spills.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.


This has not been possible.
That cannot be right!
Sooner or later it will happen.
Who pays for this?
The road network cannot be beaten.
Consider yourselves what that means.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Dhaene.
The debate is closed.
The same applies to adults.
That will need to change.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Parliament is to vote on it tomorrow.
I would also like to thank Mr¬†Markov.
Good controls are essential.
Some were debated this very morning.
We certainly have not wasted time.
Thank you for your collaboration.
The debate is closed.
It would be appropriate to check.
This is that moment.
That is the first point.
That is the first thing.
¬†¬† Very good!
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
That is not my main point, though.
¬†¬† .
The Commission‚Äôs proposal is good.
That needs to be emphasised too.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Rapporteur, what is your opinion?
¬†¬† .
We approved that motion.
¬†¬† .
President. ‚Äì That concludes the vote.

I am voting in favour of the report.
I voted in favour of the report.
I voted in favour of the report.
Hence our vote against the proposal.
I therefore endorse the report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
True, the text could be improved.

I therefore voted in favour.
Hence our vote in favour.
I welcome the Commission‚Äôs proposal.
In this respect I agree ...
¬†¬† .
We welcome all of this.
¬†¬† .
This has been my view for some time.
We know what our obligations are.
We must ensure they are met.
¬†¬† .
I voted against the de Roo report.
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore apologise for being late.
Decision time is approaching.

(1)
I am sure this will please him!
I am extremely grateful to you.
That is also our last priority.
My group is in favour of this.
One only has to look to the past.
I hope it does.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
How specific are our proposals?
There are two points to be made.
We simply help agriculture.
Islands have to be helped.
Solidarity is called for.
We value his work greatly.
I should like this to go on record.
I find this most disappointing.
We have argued this strongly.
Parliament has no objections.
The limit is 90%.
It will be drastically impoverished.
¬†¬† ¬†Thank you, Mr¬†President.
The funds must be used wisely.
¬†¬† .
That is quite simply untrue.
There will be more money.
The debate is closed.
It will actually try to take the lead.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The report does this House credit.
It must, however, also be adequate.
¬†¬† The debate is closed;
Let me be blunt about that too.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Section II ‚Äì Council
Section IV ‚Äì Court of Justice
Section V ‚Äì Court of Auditors
Section VIII ‚Äì Ombudsman
¬†¬† .
Both are essential.
¬†¬† .


Then we will pause for Croatia.
We now have twelve agencies.
I would like to pay tribute to that.
¬†¬† .
Parliament has made progress.
But two big eyesores remain.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
That is not meant at all ironically.
I have two concrete questions.
¬†¬† That concludes the item.
¬†¬† .
This is not our aim.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
This is always good news for Europe.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is an economic and social crime.
...
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Dimas.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
Its conclusions are positive.
That work is under way.
You are fobbing me off.
What are these amendments?
Do you agree?
Could this be possible?
¬†¬† .

This is the roaming policy.
¬†¬† .
Mr Paasilinna is unhappy.
¬†¬† .
I believe they are absurd.
The Commissioner will reply.
We are not totally enslaved into this.
Today this partnership works.
That is one case.
Every effort must be made to get this.
Is this really mere window dressing?
It was high time to change this format.
Is there anything left to do?
Certainly.
You ask yourself sometimes: is that so?
¬†¬† .
I have been with you for both halves.
I think this is indefensible.
Finally, the Eurostat affair.
Mr Br√ºner should go!
That is our main interest.
Up to now it has been wasting its time.
It is as simple as that.
My warm thanks to you, many times over.
You have not been treated unfairly.
I very much miss him.
The debate is closed.
That is not reciprocity.
Article 1 states what we have to do.
This is not a genuine agreement.
I think that is extremely regrettable.
This has now been happening for a year.
This matter has taken a sorry course.
That is something we welcome.
My group want a legal opinion on this.
I do not agree with that.
I think that is very important.
That is the issue.
It is absurd to express that suspicion.
That is not the problem.
I do not believe that is the case.
What if?
I will make one simple point.
When that happens, who will be blamed?
The debate is closed.
The debate will now proceed.
Mr President, I do not think so.
That is not new, Commissioner.
¬†¬† .
The issue deserved better.
We know where it is.
This is not a new subject.
This is not acceptable.
This cannot be accepted, Mr¬†President.
I call on Mrs¬†Angelilli to name names.
I am therefore optimistic in this area.
What has happened?
There is not a word about that.
It is like that in Italy.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Let me come to calmer matters.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
That is completely out of the question.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We did make the effort!
(1)
How and when is rather complicated.
That is my first point.
What is going on here is scandalous!
Thank you for your advice.
I need time this morning to do so.
Let me be quite clear.
Thank you for giving me the floor.
¬†¬† .
The choice and the decision is theirs.
It is a difficult time.
We understand that.
We understand the history.
Let me explain why.
There can be no misunderstanding.
Let me be quite undiplomatic.
Sadly, this has not been achieved.
As before, I am willing to do so.
Let me make one point in conclusion.
That is impossible to achieve.
That is the difference.
We can do no more than that.
This means turning back.
Who with?
Under whose auspices?
With what international support?
The opposite is the case.
The present situation will be frozen.
Cyprus stands at a historic juncture.
'Yes' took courage.
The Annan Plan is a .
We should not downplay the situation.
The country has undergone a war.
And then you talk about the plan.
This is an historic plan.
What is our response?
Then we will see what happens.
Very many of you are religious.
I believe in miracles.
That is of course unacceptable.
That is unacceptable.
It is no longer the Turkey of 1974.
They are well-intentioned advice.
He was too polite.
They have been poorly led for years.
We cannot persecute our own citizens.
That is the truth of the matter.
A distorted picture is being given.
Let us call for that.
We will see to the rest later.
Well, that people will have its say.
Let me give you some examples.
We want a yes vote.
These no longer exist.
Not in order to keep them divided.
I welcome that call.
I am getting ahead of myself.
What is the Commissioner afraid of?
It is the time of truth.
A no vote requires an answer.
We must ask the same of the UN.
They could not.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It does not come as a surprise.
The debate is closed.
So be it.
How could one hope for anything else?

Let me make a second point.
We must also reiterate that demand.
However, the result was a wake-up call.
The United States backs Israel 100%.
The EU could go still further.
Some years ago, I met Shimon Perez.
Let us make use of the fact.
That is emphatically not the case.
There is nothing else available.
That point has to be made clear.



The issue of anti-Semitism was raised.
Her point has been taken.
That is not the case.
They are an abomination.
We all condemn them.
We have to be even-handed in this.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
He was talking about Cyprus.

In the circumstances it is a good deal.
The status quo is unsustainable.
That is the important point.
First of all, HIV/AIDS.
I believe that is the right timing.
We are indeed concerned by many things.
I shall reply to Mr Martin in detail.
That was broadcast and discussed.
We will continue our work.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
I will not go through them all.
This is part of our European identity.
Let us stop this, please.
It is not acceptable.
We accept it, but do it now, please.
Thank you.
We have 338 amendments.
So, why are we not voting right now?
Here we begin a rather sorry story.
That is my proposal.

We are facing an obstacle course.
You have 350.
I would ask for this fact to be noted.


¬†¬† .
I would now like to take your advice.
¬†¬† . ‚Äì I am surprised.
...
¬†¬† Would everyone please relax.
Please calm down.
You will all get a fair hearing.
I do not know the detail.
¬†¬† .
The majority would decide that.
I am sorry for the long delay.
Now you have got to earn your lunch!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is not the point.
¬†¬† .
They are no longer relevant.
It is also 2.10 p.m.!
¬†¬† I leave it to the House to decide
However, the wording is too specific.
¬†¬† .
Of course, I voted against.
I voted in favour.
This deserves my support.
Accordingly, I abstained.
We have no objections to this.
Life III expires on 31 December 2004.
Naturally, I voted in favour.
I voted in favour.
Fortunately, they were voted out.
This is in bad faith.



And he was applauded for that!
It is a disgrace!


¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
Hence our vote in favour.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
You are very welcome here.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you very much indeed, Mr Roche.
Thank you very much for your comments.
I share this view.
Some have been quoted.

That is a debate for another time.
I would certainly agree with that view.
Mr Belder mentioned the Marshall Plan.
I agree.
The debate is closed.
and the
That view is shared by Pakistan itself.
We are concerned at all these issues.
They are right.
Something quite different is at stake.
Pakistan is among them.

There are benefits to what is proposed.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
This is a mixed picture.

Second topic: terrorism.
Third topic: reproductive health.
This is a little known area of health.
I will reiterate it here.
But there is still some way to go.
It is an important debate.
All of that is to be welcomed.
Shame on them!
Is this genuine?
They have intrinsic value.
Women‚Äôs rights are human rights.
Yet exactly the opposite has happened.
We have no news of them.
There is also a new danger here.
Human rights are not divisible.
I wish him well.
I wish them all well.
I want to finish on a positive note.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Is he proud of that?
That would have been a tragic mistake.
¬†¬† .
This is well-known.
However, we have to try.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Why will it be only one stage?
That is my prediction.
The PPE Group has been taken in hand.
I do not see that as such a bad idea.

I think you are aware of that too.
I am a German MEP.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Vila.
The jury protested.
The same applies to Liverpool.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
What is the proposal?
This modification is also acceptable.
This is now going to change.

The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
I do not think so.
I am sure it was not.
There are two reasons why I think not.
We have learnt from this.
I am in favour of resisting.
That is the decisive point.
He has now signed the motion.
You could call it nepotism.
That is not true parliamentarianism.


That is not the case here.


¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Let me conclude with that.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.

We would like the opposite.
I will not elaborate further.
Our basic budget was EUR 163 million.
The future is bright.
I turn now to the e-content+ programme.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
(1)
This is not acceptable in a democracy.
He has served his sentence.
¬†¬† We shall bear this in mind.
I first met her in the late 1980s.
This is not before time.
Two examples.
The situation is quite extraordinary.
This cannot continue.
It has been restarted twice.
The verdict is identical.
It is not good enough.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m.
This is the subject of Amendment 5.
¬†¬† .
She is right to make that call.
Thank you.
It is already flexible.
I cannot see how it could be otherwise.
Companies do not want them.
This needs to be increased.
This scenario did not work.
I think that there are alternatives.
Thank you, Mrs Randzio-Plath.
How can investment be encouraged?
Failure is inevitable.
Another way is to be opened up.
National policies differ.
It needs to be said.
We do not want that.
I wonder whether it is enough though.
Why is it so important for us?
Size definitely matters.
We must strengthen implementation.
We cannot continue to dodge the issue.


There are, of course, two ways.
It is time we realised this.
Where do our opportunities lie?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m.
(1)
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
So there it is.
¬†¬† That was very neutrally put!
(1)
¬†¬† We will not reopen the debate.
No.
No.
No.
No.
¬†¬† This is a very sensitive issue.
I will be brief.
We will now move on to the vote.
Fortunately that is not the case.
The two words have been removed.
You should have been informed of that.
¬†¬† I am sorry, you are wrong.
I wish you well.
(2)
That concludes the vote.
I myself told him about the matter.
Hence my vote.
I voted for rejection of the proposal.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour of it.
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour of the report.
¬†¬† .
Human Rights Watch did not respond.
Neither responded.
¬†¬† .
Consequently, I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† . I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour of the report.
These areas have many resources.
¬†¬† .
Naturally, I voted in favour.
But he is not telling the whole truth.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Procedures are important.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
In fact, that is not the case here.
It is detrimental to us all.
It is a threat to the rule of law.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

This explains why I voted as I did.
This is understandable.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


I voted against the report.
¬†¬† .
This is not all, however.
They are also less often self-employed.
We must open our eyes, Mr President.
I have mixed feelings though.
What are they doing?
It takes a lot of work.
That is the current situation.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
However, much still remains to be done.
The mine threat can be overcome.
This is part of the problem.
The debate is closed.
Why do ordinary Cubans take such risks?
That picture is not entirely accurate.
I have personal experience of this.
It is therefore correct.
This is what is at stake.
This is a diabolical state of affairs.
On the contrary, we defend them.
This is not the case.
We regret the current situation.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
This is an issue of human dignity.
¬†¬† .
In my view they are not a special case.
They lost their innocence ages ago.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
What should be done?
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr R√ºbig.
¬†¬† We shall proceed to the vote(1).
(2)
This situation must stop.
We can only do it together.
That dream has become reality.
We should congratulate them all.
It was our House that did that!
Let us rejoice in that!
That will benefit all of us.
And that is what makes the difference.

Europe is being reborn.
Why?
That is true.
Therefore, we must all take action.
He is our guest today in this Chamber.
¬†¬† Mr¬†President.
It counts.
As a voter, I have some significance.
I help to wield influence.
History does not develop by chance.
Europe would like to be political.
These are political acts of faith.
What are the true pillars of reality?
Are there any comments?
'I have never ever made these claims.
I am an Austrian.
I replied: 'Absolutely necessary.
(1)
Are there any comments?
¬†¬† .
We will hear the rapporteur.
(1)
He would have reason to rejoice.
That day is upon us.
Now is the time for new ambitions.
We wish them well in that work.
¬†¬† .
The famous step-by-step policy.
And that is what happened.
‚ÄòLet us unite men‚Äô, said Monnet.
The baby was important.
Many people were not impressed.
Now they have joined the EPP-ED Group.
This is what Europe was.
I believe that is now possible.
That concludes the debate.
Of that I am absolutely convinced.
We chose the constitutional path.
I understand Mr Roche‚Äôs argument.
Finally, we now have a Community of 25.

Such a thing must not be permitted.
The answer is certainly 'yes'.
Perhaps Minister Roche could explain.

What exactly does this analysis say?
See you soon!
That is a shame.

Liberal democracy has triumphed.
What do we need the Constitution for?

The EU will never be the same again.
We face huge challenges.
We actively contributed our views.
Therefore, quiet please.
Cooperation means coercion.
More is the pity.
In Old Polish, I wish it Godspeed.
What are these foundations?
We want a well-managed Europe.
An institutional balance is required.
An accommodation is called for.
This will make for deeper integration.
Our citizens want more Europe.
We cannot go along with this.
These are not good omens.
New states are waiting at our doors.
Soon Bulgaria and Romania will join.
Much remains to be done.


I shall continue in Maltese.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
This is the vote, not a debate.
There are some misunderstandings here.
That has been done.
I shall take no more speakers on this.
That concludes the vote.
My masters, are we mad?
So far not one penny has arrived.
He has failed spectacularly.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
(1)
MEPs are prisoners of flight schedules.
The sequence is clear.
We should remember their sacrifice.
The hard part really begins today.
That must be our priority.
That is not, however, the end.
The EU will continue to grow.
This will be a priority task.
Enlargement, however, is continuing.
I also enjoyed it very much.
I have two small suggestions.
This is too few.
We have been told.
The same applies to Croatia.
That is just not logical.
Let us hope it is gone forever.
I agree with Commissioner Verheugen.
We long for justice and progress.
The cross stands for love triumphant.
Is it no more than a free trade area?
For me, that would be too little.

Where does Europe end?
United, we are stronger and wiser.
This is a kind of disease.
Now everything depends on us.
That is why we believe in cooperation.
We must not stop here.
Our desire is to reunite our country.

Welcome to you all, all ten of you.
God bless our joint work.
I warn against it.
We have a choice to make:
or,
The Council decision will be respected.
It will in fact be strengthened.
I have strong views on this.
This is where we are.
The challenge is still there.
This is not what we should do.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
That is the Europe we are to build.
That alone that will make us strong.
What, though, is the reality?
Production is decreasing.
The alter anti-globalists are right.
I very much regret that.
We must face up to facts.
Being among the best is ennobling.

It would be a Europe of solidarity.
My reply is that it will.
It must survive.
We are now in the year 2004.
Our first goal is a sovereign Poland.
Our second goal concerns the economy.
They will be local jobs.
Our common market has grown.
I will end with a few words in Maltese.
We must give impetus to this policy.
I am optimistic.
These words do have real meaning.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Freedom, security and justice.
I reject that.
You spoke of companies and businesses.
There is a lot for us to do.
I shall just mention a couple more.
I hope that will be taken on board.
This is not acceptable.
We have to take down the barriers.
Some prevention, and some stopping.
The day has yet to declare it.
We have a big job ahead of us.
It is called 'Europe Needs an FBI'.
This should not happen.
This is what will happen this time.
This is not just a question of faith.
Thank you so much.
The debate is now closed.
(1)
(1)
¬†¬† Mr President, on a point of order.
I will not repeat what she said.
I shall do so this week.
¬†¬† Thank you Mr Perry.
Politics abhors a vacuum.
The first is the euro.
The third event is the Convention.
We are right behind you.
On that, Mr Poettering and I agree.
Let us read between the lines here.
My second appeal is as follows.
You act to their disadvantage.
Are these to remain empty words?
Are we not bound to implement them?
Thank you very much.
¬†¬† . ‚Äì This is a sensitive issue.
Thank you.
I am pronouncing this verdict openly.
¬†¬† . ‚Äì I totally agree.
In this we succeeded.

Good luck!
I know there is a lot to be done.
Such a Europe will survive.
I am fortunate to know many of them.
This is the main problem.
That is Europe for you!
¬†¬† .
I feel that these are strong arguments.
Africa is our responsibility.
Europe has 800 million inhabitants.
I was a second-class citizen.
Ukraine is a part of Europe.
It shares our cultural heritage.
As for Ukraine, I agree entirely.
This is a union of peoples and nations.
¬†¬† .
We need more cohesion.
¬†¬† That concludes the item.
Our actions have ranged much wider.
I am proud of that fact.
We brought the animation of politics.
We brought the Europe of values.
It is a disgrace.
I thank my cabinet.
I have to take a deep breath!
Next week¬†...
...¬†We are members of a parliament.
This is my last wish.
You have been an excellent President.
It was concluded this morning.
Thank you.
This is the measure of a true democrat.
This report has been prepared.
Thank you very much.

Josep Borrel Fontelles
Bronis≈Çaw Geremek
Francis Wurtz
Mr Louis
Mr P√°lfi
Mr Paleckis
Mr Ortuondo Larrea
Mr Onyszkiewicz
Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou
Mr Pannella
Mr Pistelli
I am very aware of this.
Thank you very much.
I come from Central¬†Europe.
Nonetheless, we won through.
That is the way it is.
That too is what democracy is about.
We shall now proceed to the election.
Number of voters: 700
Blank or spoiled ballot papers: 53
Votes cast: 647
Jos√© Borrell Fontelles: 388 votes
Bronis≈Çaw Geremek: 208 votes
Francis Wurtz: 51 votes
Thank you very much to all of you.
All the best and congratulations!
Some of the candidates are very new.
We shall proceed to the vote(2).
(3)
(1)
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Martin.
We deeply appreciate all their help.
Like Parliament, I wish it well.
They gave me very good advice.
It is a challenge for a small country.
We do not have an enormous bureaucracy.
I wish you every success with it.

I must say that that is not the case.
He has not changed.
That is not on.
That is not just a matter of protocol,
None of that is fair.
The European Union comes out stronger.
We were there, we were players.
I thank you all the same.
We really cannot go on like this!
I think he got it right.
The electorate is entitled to a vote.
Such a Union is a disgrace.
Welcome.
That is a pity.
Thank you, Mr President.
We have had the Irish presidency.
There is more to do.
Now bring your energy home.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
We will see decisive improvements.
It also gives the EU a capacity to act.
That is what our task will be now.
...
I do not think that has happened.
Europe could have chosen a better way.
This leads me to a question.
I think that this is a great pity.
Why is a country large or small?
We have been doing that for 17 years.
We are proud that we have done that.
We enlarged to 25 Member States.
We have agreed a Constitution.
I wish you well too, Mr President.
Thank you all for your attention.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
This is our true strength.
You mentioned the internal market.
You mentioned enlargement.
You spoke of Europe‚Äôs values.
Treaties are to be kept to!
the two belong together.
That is, quite simply, a scandal.
We need a debate on Turkey.
See you in September.
What is to be done?
Europe must be more visible.
What is so modern about that?
I really mean this.
Europe must regain a human dimension.
I do indeed hope that it will.
The same is true of the Stability Pact.
We cannot agree to it.
Thank you.
¬†¬† Thank you very much.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is suspended.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mrs Gill.
Mr James Nicholson
Mrs Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl
Mrs Mia De Vits
Mrs Genowefa Grabowska
Mrs Anneli J√§√§tteenmaki
Mrs Astrid Lulling
It needs economic and social cohesion.
It needs the Lisbon Strategy.
Why?
There is no rush.
However, we must begin now.
This is important but it is not enough.
We are indeed very strong in this.
We wish you much luck!
We cannot have it both ways.
Secondly, the Lisbon objective.
Europe needs this.
Can the presidency deliver?
That is the question.
I wish them well in the presidency.
¬†¬† .
I have listened carefully to you.
Moreover, I understand this wish.
I have listened carefully to you.
My third point is sustainability.
You are aware of this.
How does the citizen experience Europe?
I then discern two voices.
That is what it is all about.
Freedom, solidarity and respect.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
(1)
That seems to be the problem.
I shall repeat the list of candidates:
(1)
¬†¬† .
As Jean Monnet said, ‚Äò‚Äô
We must build our Europe together.
Words must be transformed into actions.
What we do we must do well.
It will be a great challenge.
The challenge now is ratification.
Reforms are needed.
We must put growth centre stage.
Europe must be a success.
Thank you for your attention.
We believe you can do this.
You spoke of a partnership for Europe.
A lot of it was wrong.
That is the question we are asking.
May I say one thing in conclusion?
One can come close to it, however.
You say you are a committed European.
What kind of pilot would you be?
What kind of plane is your Europe?
What is your destination?
It is like a dream come true.
What a magical transformation!
Another thing, Mr Barroso.
You are the third spare wheel.
We are doormats anyway.
That is what we have to decide.
They are revealing.
We really are not up to it.
Who are the members of these?
Who go to the meetings?
Why cannot we know these facts?
I am not saying that this happens.
You say you stand for one.
The same applies for jobs.
That would be a pity.
I do not believe that is correct.
Thank you very much for that.
Thank you.
Nevertheless, they did not win.
We know that the world is not fair.
We can always hope.
Why is that the case?
There are two important explanations.
This is highly undemocratic.
Turkish accession is a case in point.
I cannot believe that.
You have achieved that.
We are now in another political phase.
And that is the way it works.
You have put it quite rightly.
We all agree on this.
It is a vote of confidence.
The policy on chemicals, for example.
I might mention the Budget Regulation.
What does Europe mean to them?
You mentioned it among many others.
I confess I am still unsatisfied.
We must have incentives to create jobs.
We will never tire of saying this.

No.
People expect concrete results from us.
Can you give hope to those who lost it?
Europe alone is not enough.
That is my vision for Europe.
That is my vision.
¬†¬† The debated is suspended.
It will resume tomorrow at 9 a.m.(1)
(2)
(1)
It is not an impulsive act.
We did not spare you.

The situation has also changed for us.
This is a momentous event.
We cannot agree to cuts in the budget.
Europe was torn apart at Yalta.
That is our first question.
This leads me to the next question.
Good luck.
This is Europe‚Äôs identity.

We will not support it.
I will therefore vote for you.
This means standing up to George Bush.
I hope we can rely on you.
It is important that you realise this.
Thank you for your attention.
I wish you every success.
That is why I wish him every success.
I turn now to my question.
That is much too vague and woolly.
The first concerns information.
How are you going to change your image?
Thank you.
How might we achieve that?
Africa is, of course, a priority here.
That is the reality.
I am very proud to be a European.
We have our own identity.
That is vital as far as I am concerned.
I am in favour of equal opportunities.
That is the direction I wish to go in.

What was Europe like 50 years ago?
What has it become today?
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Barroso.
(2)
This right must be strictly respected.
The fourth question was...
Unreliable partner!
You heard this House out.
Yesterday you delivered these.
I love you.

Just look at the Commission!
We saw the Eurostat scandal.
But he believes in a political Europe.

We also know that he is not arrogant.
That is all.
There are others.
I will work with all of you.

Now is not the moment to do so.(1)
I jest not.
It is a restrained request.
We lack measures, resources and money.
That Regulation has not worked.
How?

Words are never enough.
We are addressing that.

I once again thank you for this debate.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
This is already serious in itself.
We are now facing the same problem.
Why is that so?
Let me thank you again for that.
I also hope that you will win the day.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.



What has the European Commission done?
Secondly, I am a Euro-sceptic.
We have to get the facts right.
Thank you for a good debate.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(1)
No analysis equates to justification.
This has become known as relocation.
I invite you all to play your part.
The House must prove it to the world.
All these issues will be raised.
It is much more than a budget.
The plenary is to decide on this today.
Let me tell you what our main task is.
The best of luck to you!

You must make sure that it does.
The first is in reform of this House.
We cannot hide behind it.



The voters have spoken.
We respect their decisions.
If not you, then who?
If not you, then who?
Who shall speak for you?
If not you, then who?'
¬†¬† Thank you Mr President.
You are faced with trying times.
Thank you for your attention.
These are our friends.
Where is the democracy in such cases?
Pharisees and hypocrites!
It is not Parliament‚Äôs job.
This is not prejudice, these are facts.
This is not prejudice.
Organised crime is low.
Our appeal must be one of goodwill.
Thank you for your attention.
Unquote.
Thank you for your attention.
Official ideology rules in the country.
This is a paradox!
It is our duty.
Are there any funds?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.

I would ask you to respect them.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Is it because of the Stability Pact?
Is it due to a lack of political will?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you for your cooperation.
Is that, though, what he wanted?
There is no alternative.
We must make room for this in 2005.
We are all in agreement on this.
We will have to wait and see.
Well, this is possible.
That is something we cannot forget.
No.
I am in favour of the Protocol.
No, it is not.
Europe alone is not enough.
The brain drain.
The debate is closed.
(1)
I assume that they are a sound basis.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We each look after our own budget.
The same is true for structural policy.
We will be sure to keep an eye on this.
Has poverty died out?
Are there no more problems?
I do not think so.
That has not yet happened.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Now let us move on to the next speaker.
Thank you for your attention.
Five billion!
There is more.
This is a setback in my view.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
So we can rest assured on that score.
That is what we have done today.
The second point refers to employment.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
Nevertheless, we have taken action.
That is the question.
Could you give any examples?
We have no legal basis in this field.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
There will be no generic approvals.
Farmers may choose to use them or not.
They can use any of the varieties.
I have a second question.
That is the reality.
That is not enough, however.
I have met all the sectors.
I am not declaring war on anybody.
I am told we can continue to talk.
We can always carry on talking.
None of that has happened.
What has happened?
It is encouraging.
¬†¬† .
Finally, the way forward.
This is a must.
What are the points to be discussed?
The first is the ethnic context.
There is massive sexual violence.
This should be stopped immediately.
They are contravening the no-fly zone.
The pattern of violence must stop.
Most of these are children.
Thank you for giving me the floor.
That is not the case at the moment.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr President.
It demands immediate action.
Every day the situation worsens.


The EU will probably follow suit.
We have to be willing to take action.
This needs to be supported.
We need to do more.
The UN's role is absolutely essential.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
It is a threat that we cannot neglect.
We need to protect our citizens better.
There are no quick fixes for terrorism.
The UN is at the core.
I turn now to the presidency programme.
That brings me to terrorism in Russia.
This gives rise to concern.
¬†¬† .
Dialogue inevitably involves questions.
Who were those involved?
Many civilians have simply disappeared.
This is a time of grief and shock.
That is what partners do.
That is true.
So should we.
That is a fact; indeed, it has been.
Who made human beings into monsters?
Colonial wars bring forth barbarians.
Nothing.
It is not just an emerging problem.
Why is this so?
What happened?
What has come to pass?
How are these facts to be denied?
Think about it, Mr Bot.
That is not easy.
Terrorism is wrong wherever it occurs.
We can no longer afford this.
This is a matter of joint concern.
There is a great deal more going on.
A military solution is not possible.
When will it end however?
That is a dead end.
Thank you for your attention.
Let me briefly explain my own judgment.
What is to be done?
These are not ordinary Chechens ...
What we need instead is ...
Those are the undeniable facts.

I have mentioned a few measures.
How can we fight terrorism jointly?
What are the means at our disposal?
I do not believe that to be the case.
The debate is closed.
First of all, police training.
I have enjoyed coming here.
As someone once said, 'stuff happens'.
Is global terrorism in retreat?
I simply pose the questions.
If Iraq goes badly, we all suffer.
How could I?
All done and dusted then?
Sighs of relief all round?
The rest of the world looks on.
What are we to make of all this?

But Iraq needs more than money.

So where do we stand today?
That is indeed what we must do.


Let me turn to the second confusion.
Iraq is in just that condition today.
It is a possibility.
What is NATO doing?
What is the European Union doing?
¬†¬† We now come to the vote(1).
That concludes the voting.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Invariably it is meaningless.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
I see no political realism.
I have clearly set out those goals.
¬†¬† ‚ÄìThe debate is closed.
Are there any comments?
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Tannock.
¬†¬† .
The discussion was held in two parts.
¬†¬† .
How can this be done?
By means of two possible procedures.
There is a trade-off here.
There is only ‚Äòeither/or‚Äô.
The reality is rather different.
That is what has come to pass.
One would not expect them to.
A flexible rule ceases to be a rule.
Let me end on a positive note.
I thank you for your attention.
May I ask you something?
This is the time for you to do so.
Here there is much to be done.
This wall has to be broken down.
I wish you good luck!
So let us wait a little.
The euro is an ambitious project.
Why not try out the golden rule?
That would be a mistake.
The Commission‚Äôs proposals are sound.
¬†¬† .
I have many obligations to fulfil.
I am not surprised by that.
Maybe we can reach some consensus here.
Let me pick out a few themes.
I think that is an important consensus.
That is my experience, at least.
We also have the Lisbon process.
Mr Schulz spoke of this tension.
He will be President of the Euro Group.
¬†¬† .
And how must we do this?
With more flexibility or more rigour?
With both things.
Does this require a debate?
I believe this is absolutely essential.
What action are we going to take?
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
- to the Council:
- to the Commission:
¬†¬† . Thank you Mr President.
How can it be harmful?
That is up to them.
It would make the debate more European.
This debate is myth against reality.
What action is the Commission taking?
What action is the Commission taking?
Our position is clear.
Secondly, there should be a timetable.



This is the thrust of this proposal.

¬†¬† Thank you very much.
I would like to raise three issues.
It is in our interests.
The Constitution is alive.
Three years later, there was Sedan.
I will of course abide by your rules.
Why?
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
This is unacceptable.
You gave no reply.
Moreover, the means are there.
That concludes Question Time.
()(2)

Why is this so?
I myself can be brief about this.
Information activities are not violent.
This is not what we are debating.
No.
No.
This is what we are debating.
They must never be forgotten!

I am all in favour of that.
This extends to Irish ships.
This point has already been made.
It is also offensive.
This is ridiculous.
This is ridiculous.
Should we have them arrested?
Should we close the borders?

We need to be very clear on this.
This is what we are about.
It is about choice.
It is about informed choice.
What happens then?
I have heard religion mentioned.
I am very sad.
This issue goes to the heart of Europe.
¬†¬† I thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The EU is a major legal market.
I have an open position on this.
I agree with its recommendations.
Now, however, the phrase is apt.
We are the dominant species.
Trade in its parts must be curtailed.
We cannot allow this to happen.
We have to highlight it.
This is an opportunity to do so.
Mrs Auken mentioned sea turtles.
The debate is closed.

I have made a note of this.
¬†¬† ¬†‚Äì¬†There is no problem.
¬†¬† ¬†‚Äì¬†That is clear.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Nonetheless, I had to abstain.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That question cannot be shelved.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
On what is this consensus based?
We do not feel that we are so isolated.
¬†¬† .
Fortunately they were rejected.
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
(4)
The EU does not put pressure on them.
Thailand is a case in point.
Finally, Burma has been mentioned.
Moreover, its problems are historical.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Thank you.
Why?
I support the resolution proposal.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
We have let it be.
Where does the money go?
Who collects it and where is it banked?
Then we can talk.
We want to help them.
That is not my information.
This is an outright disgrace.
The EU has already reacted strongly.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.

¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mrs McCarthy.
So, that letter has been sent.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr De Rossa.
However, there are wider issues here.
We must not facilitate that process.
I shall mention just a few examples.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Prodi.
Yes, they have been truly historic.
But there was no immediate initiative.
Finally, Mr President, the PNR affair.
I am calling a policy into question.
No, the question is never asked.
Emphatically, no.
What will be the next stage?
There‚Äôs the rub, Mr President.
It is, as they say, business as usual.
It came from the Prodi Commission.
To these we want a clear response.
In this picture, where is Europe?
You have presided over a college.
I refer to three of your experiments.
We have been deeply saddened by this.
This has been a great achievement.
¬†¬† .
Why?
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Prodi.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
How can we stop it?
It has been impossible.
Everybody knows this.
The first is security.
We are prepared to do so.
Secondly, reforms.
Thirdly, actions of an economic nature.
I hope that they have been of some use.
Let me make one obvious point.

I do not believe he is.


That takes courage on both sides.
How are we to react to this?
This policy must be rationalised.
Something had to happen.
Occupying.
But can we really only make appeals?
What can we do?
For the reality is very tough.
Gaza is another point at issue.
Double standards? Ineffectiveness?
That is what we are going to try to do.
That is what we would call rationality.
We have spent five years together.
We will not forget you.
Condemnation in word only is hypocrisy.
It is working very well.
The OECD has a role to play there.
This is going to be more difficult.
Here we are.
We are friends of Georgia.
First of all, Georgia's achievements.
It went very well.
What are the challenges that lie ahead?
Thank you.
Thank you.



¬†¬† . Thank you, Mr President.
The latter is crucial.
I shall add just three brief points.
Thank you very much.
Anti-discrimination?
If that is not discrimination, what is?
Let us look at effectiveness.
Where was the European Commission?
What happens now, though?
I thank you for that, Mr Bourlanges.
They are now free to flourish.
Mr Donner has the floor.
¬†¬† . Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Let us therefore return to the agenda.
I give the floor to Mrs Kudrycka.
I thank you.
What are they waiting for?
What has got to happen?
This situation can change.
This is the tragic paradox.
This is depressing.
But that is not working.
But where is this area, I ask myself?
Let this serve as a warning!
I wish you all the best for the future.
Thank you very much.
However, we do not cooperate enough.
Thank you very much.
It does have anything to do with camps.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
Thank you very much.
I declare today‚Äôs sitting closed.
(1)
(1)
¬†¬† . Mr President, thank you.
Why?
Which conventions would this involve?
So much for conventions.
Why more generous?
Where will the threshold lie?
Why one year earlier?
Thank you.
There is a place for that.
¬†¬† . Mr President, thank you.
So, Pascal, thank you, .
She is right.
I have almost finished on this point.
This is obviously an exaggeration.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Lamy.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
¬†¬† .
What does that mean in specific terms?
Should children use them?
(1)
It is a pain that sears through me.
Violence must be consigned to the past.
They all have their names.
Only the Kurds have no name.
We must absorb all of it.
So once again Mrs Zana, ‚Äô.
It is called money.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed(1).
That is the text of Amendment No 1.
(2)
(3)
¬†¬† We have voted against this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
I thank you.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.

(1)
Are there any comments?
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Gollnisch.
Thank you for your attention.
Never again!‚Äô.
I thank you.
¬†¬† I shall do so.
Should sexual contacts not be ...
Mr Karadzic's book is called .
¬†¬† I have received 22 requests.
¬†¬† Mr President, thank you.
I have a personal question for you.
This is certainly a source of concern.
We cannot be complacent.
Obviously not.
Why are we not growing?
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at 12.30.
This does alleviate concerns.
Fear is in the air.
What, then, lies behind this crisis?
I share Mr Bullmann‚Äôs misgivings.
It is true that demand is too low.
That is, of course, fantastic news.
The only question is: when for?
What is that other route?
The workers must be involved.
It is a competitive market.
There will inevitably be changes.
That record was last broken in 1972.
I am sure it can justify those figures.
We need to work together.
We are in a competitive market.
That is the change that is needed.
That is really not the case.
Mr Belet asked me to dream.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Their rights must be defended.
Competition must be saved at all costs.
You will see huge problems soon.





It is a sad picture.
I would like to repeat three criteria.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
(1)
I hope this will not be repeated.


For this I must thank Parliament.
This group will not be a talking shop.
We must prepare for those changes.
What are our values?
All of this must be borne in mind.
We should take note of that.
That is a significant hurdle.
That is a hurdle.
That is the salient question here.
You referred to the US elections.
This House faces a heavy choice.
First mistake.
No, they were not.
The Council nominated you.
Then there were the hearings.
Try to tread carefully.

He has got what he wanted.
Thank you for clearing that up.
That is what it is all about.
We will be voting 'no' tomorrow.
Thank you.
You did the right thing.
You have done the right thing.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you, Mr¬†President.
This must be made absolutely clear.
You are selling old wine in new skins.
We cannot accept this.
You did not comment on this.
You have not convinced us.

We cannot support it.
I apologise to Mr¬†Buttiglione.
This is something we cannot agree to.
Mr¬†Barroso, I wish you luck.
You chose to do the opposite.
That is constitutionally acceptable.
That is unacceptable.
Mr Buttiglione!
What matters is that he catches mice.
This is democracy in action.
One wonders if it can get much worse.
I for one will not lend the veneer ‚Ä¶
This is very difficult for us to judge.
I wish you good luck.
I hope we will demonstrate it tomorrow.
I still have my doubts.
And why?
It is laughable, ladies and gentlemen!
Good luck, Mr Barroso.
It is time to be serious, that is true.
I thank you.
That is not an ideal way to proceed.
Replace him, and we shall support you.
So what are our reasons?
That is of no use to anybody.
You need to stand up to the Council.
Let us not beat about the bush.
There is the new Constitutional Treaty.
The Lisbon process too has to succeed.
We give Mr¬†Barroso our support.
There are so many issues before us.
You have our support, Mr Barroso.
You are mistaken.
You are mistaken.
Thank you.
The responsibility is yours.
Mr Barroso, our position is clear.
Is this a positive message?
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you.
I would crave your indulgence for this.
Mr¬†Barroso has the floor.
It is not possible.
I must take an objective view.
I have the greatest respect for you.
That is what we must do.
I believe that would be bad for Europe.
Success often attracts counter forces.
Rome was not built in one day.

More is the pity, Mr¬†Barroso.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
‚Äì That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
They are the following:

This is not acceptable either.
¬†¬† .
We are actually very thrifty.
This has to change!

¬†¬† .
This is not, therefore, the time.
¬†¬† .
They are Amendments Nos 98 and 99.
I would like to highlight four of them.
It is very simple.
What a great development!
Congratulations on this achievement!
Why is this so?
This is a quite crucial challenge.
A change is therefore needed.
That is just not on!
All these things are crammed in on top.
¬†¬† ,.
My group backs these proposals.
¬†¬† , .
The second reason relates to substance.
I thank you.
¬†¬† .¬†¬†¬†Thank you, Mr¬†President.
Thank you.
This is not politics, but accountancy.
I should also like to thank Mr Garriga.
All of that costs money.
I see rural areas as part of this too.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
I thank you.
That is from where the tensions arise.
Many thanks.
This is in no way acceptable!
Let me concentrate on one issue.
We should reject this budget.
My last point concerns animal diseases.
My congratulations go out to them.
Mrs Schreyer, women can do it!
Absolutely nothing.
Thank you very much.
That would pay for all those agencies.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
I thank you.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is unfortunate.
I hope that is relatively clear.
How is this possible?
¬†¬† ¬†Thank you, Madam¬†President.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The Commission looks into all of them.
¬†¬† .
I have nothing to add at this stage.
Thank you.
That is surely absurd.
¬†¬† . Thank you for that observation.
This is not an option.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner Monti.
I much appreciate that.
It is much appreciated.
I appreciate that.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
I wish him well.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Crowley.
Four subjects will be discussed.
This now has to change.

The choice is yours.
Not many.
Not enough.
That was the original aim in 2000.
I thank you.
¬†¬† .¬†¬†¬†Thank you, Mr¬†President.
Clearly, a choice has to be made.
I thank you.
It certainly does not.
We will not agree to this.
The second issue is terrorism.
The third issue is Tampere.
We will need to act boldly on this.

How can the situation be rectified?
Which priorities would this involve?
I thank you.
These figures are appalling.
What nonsense!
I disagree with Mr Evans on this point.
It is a productive factor.
We need to bear that in mind.
That is exactly what we are doing.
We shall be discussing these.
You cannot be compelled to remain here.


I renew that commitment today.
You can count on me.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Barroso.
I believe there is a point of order.
¬†¬† That is not a point of order.
Mr Pannella, you do not have the floor.
Mr Schulz has the floor.
We shall meet again in plenary at noon.
Mr Poettering has the floor first.
is a strong European Commission.
This is intolerable.
¬†¬† .
So, welcome to the club, Mr Poettering.
Our strength is your strength.
Work fast!
You know the will of this Chamber.
Wonderful, do it, do it!
We say that loud and clear.
That would not have been good.
That is something you need to know.
May their promise be fulfilled!
It is the engine of integration.
It is now on the Net as an experiment.
Many thanks.
¬†¬† Thank you very much.
That is not a point of order.
This point is important.
It is a pluralist Commission.
I therefore did what I had to do.
It is not a football match.
That much is obvious.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Barroso.
But that is not the case.
Are there any comments?
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†Many thanks, Mr¬†President.
¬†¬† Thank you for those comments.
Are there no more comments?
¬†¬† .
We hope India will react positively.
I will focus on the latter.
We want to maintain that.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This report does just the opposite.


This appears highly improbable.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr¬†Nicola√Ø.
The debate is closed.
Firstly, what has the EU to offer?
But how big is this carrot?
And that I deeply regret.
This offer is also valid for Belarus.
¬†¬† .
This situation calls for a response.
I thank you.
If they can, they leave the country.
There is no hope any more.
Many thanks.
We all know what happened.
What action can now be taken?
Above all, major changes are needed.
Many thanks.
No.
What action should be taken?
¬†¬† Mr President, dear colleagues.
The short answer to this is ‚Äòno‚Äô.
It is time to take action.
¬†¬† .
I will give a few examples.
We have grave concerns about this.
I thank you.
We should have confidence in Ukraine.
That would be a step too far.
It would simply pose new challenges.
It simply cannot afford to do so.
We all need a programme of this kind.
That is not the worst of it, however.
Yet Ukraine is no exception.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
We shall take questions to the Council.
¬†¬† . Mr President, thank you.
The problems are accumulating.
I fear that a crisis is looming.
I have two questions.
Is there some sort of timetable?
How do you view its content?
That is what I want to know.
¬†¬† . Mr President, thank you.
¬†¬† . Mr President, thank you.
¬†¬† . Mr President, thank you.
Thank you.
¬†¬† . Thank you for the question.
¬†¬† . Mr President, thank you.
¬†¬† Mr President, thank you.
¬†¬† . Mr President, thank you.
¬†¬† . Mr President, thank you.
¬†¬† Thank you for your answer.
¬†¬† . Mr President, I do apologise.
In that case, Question Time is closed.
Question Time is closed.
I think I am the last.
Thank you for your understanding.
((1)
That time is still very close.
For me, the answer is simple.
On the contrary.
Without training, no job and no salary.
There is no simple solution.
Who cares?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
They will not work.
We know that we have to be realistic.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote on the
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Your request is very reasonable.
Are there any objections?
¬†¬† .
What do I mean by this?
(1)
(2)
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is a good, simple idea.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
For the moment, I shall abstain.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That therefore concludes voting time.
I would like to add two comments.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We were cruelly disappointed.
But this is almost a detail.
Has it produced any results?
No, we cannot point to any progress.
The situation is truly intolerable.
This is also a short cut.
What image do we have of Iran today?
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Casaca.
The debate is closed.
What are we Europeans waiting for?
The old Europe cannot tolerate that.
It details a string of abuses.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place next.
¬†¬† We shall proceed to the vote on:
(1)
They have been held captive ever since.
I do not understand.
This beggars belief.
Our message must be clear.
He believed in a better world.
Let us spare a thought for him.
I am talking about the Castro regime.
That is our Europe!
Most have been closed down.
Thank you very much.
There is no time to lose.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
More certainly needs to be done.
¬†¬† .
Where is the problem?


Yes, EU countries have made progress.
There remains much to do, however.
The EU can and must go further.
This debate is part of our reaction.
Since then, the world has changed.
China has changed, but not the regime.
No, we must be consistent.
We are all right behind you.
If yes, then which one?
But that would have no effect.
It is important to be aware of that.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Only then could negotiations start.
What are we in this House now to do?
Do they meet the requirements?
¬†¬† .
I believe that would be a triumph.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† . I cannot add very much.
and
¬†¬† Thank you for your motion.
I promise you we will check it.
That is exactly what it has done.
Thank you very much.
We are not financing intransigence.
Once again, all credit for this.
Allow me to give you an example.
The occupying army is to blame.
The money will be wasted.
More steps must follow soon.
This is not a 'zero-sum' game.
They are our compatriots.
That is our objective.
We must not forget this.
That is the matter I wish to address.
That would not be sensible.
I wish to make three other points.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Failure is relative.
The EU can commit to this too.
Let us work hard on the remaining 45%.
It is our duty to help them.
Profound changes are now inevitable.
But we involve them all.
That is why it is ingenious.
It is so important.
The debate is therefore closed.
¬†¬† . I want to commend Mr¬†Putin.
Hence my proposal for Amendment No 3.
¬†¬† .
This is not the time.
Thank you.
Firstly the dates.
This is easier said than done.
I hope we will meet again soon.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
They are faring badly.
Many of them are ill.
I have met many of these people.
That is why they had to be silenced.
That is why they have been imprisoned.
Castro continues to be intractable.
That would be very unfortunate.
Let us show them which side we are on.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We look on this with solidarity.
¬†¬† . Mr President, thank you.
His word is law.
Just ask the opposition.
I thank you.
That is the question we must answer.
That is what is needed.
Amnesty first, and then dialogue.
We need to be honest.
That is a fact.
However, we have to be realistic.
Where has that ever got anyone?
What is Europe‚Äôs objective?
The answer is simple: nothing.
They were the ones who cut off contact.
The current method is not working.
What about Spain?
I do not think so.
¬†¬† .
This really is not the place.
Nobody can give any guarantees.
We should not make it a straitjacket.
The debate is closed.
I would repeat that today.
This will be effective on 1 April 2005.
We should not fool ourselves, though.
First of all, Iraq.
We will do this in December.
I should like to do the same now.
¬†¬† .
What is this about?
That would seem to be urgently needed.
This is not just a home affairs issue.
I doubt it.
I thank you.
That is not all, however.
We need assurance on this point.
Europe needs better regulation.
We must improve our methodology.
We must ensure that we work together.
There is strength in partnership.
I would now like to turn to Lisbon.
Finally, Lisbon. The goal is clear.
This task is not easy.
Why?
What does this mean in practice?
We would be unable to object to this.
There is no consensus on this.
Thank you.
The Netherlands is learning!
That is the challenge we are facing.
I was in Iraq last week.
We are not a carbon copy of America.
Everyone has signed it.
Is that it then?
I also remember that he failed.
This is promising.
Thank you.
Why should this take so long?
This is a worthwhile initiative.
Integration. Not policing.
Their experience cannot be ignored.
Otherwise we are not being consistent.
The first is the situation in Iraq.
Thank you very much.
This, however, is far from the truth.
Let me start with the Hague Programme.
Is that true?
I think that that was a sound formula.
I have understood your message.
The Constitution was also mentioned.
Legislation is not the same everywhere.
You know what the deal is.
This brings me to the end of my speech.
Money is also essential.
One per cent is not enough!
We can do better.
Thank you, and good luck.
¬†¬† ¬†Thank you, Mr¬†Nielson.
You have the floor, Mr President.
¬†¬† .
In reply it said, 'Not at all'.
He said, 'So what am I yakking about?
Not one.
Enough already.'
The Africa you know so well is poor.
Parliament appreciates his presence.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
(1)
Naturally, we are against.
(2)
That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
I voted in favour.
We need to ask this question.
Parliament seeks a ‚Äòfair‚Äô decision.
Hence our vote.
Why is this the case?
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .I'll be supporting this report.
Yet China is now transformed.
How, then, is it to be annulled now?
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
Naturally, we want dialogue with Cuba.
How?
Thank you very much.
¬†¬† .
Let me add two comments.
We may not agree on every issue.

So let us now get on with our job!
Let me put forward three of them.
My second conclusion is this.
The hour of decision is now upon us.
This Commission is of higher quality.
By that we shall judge you.
Tomorrow I believe it will.
Mr Piebalgs and Mr Kov√°cs did well.
This is a better Commission.
That is not enough.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Good luck.
Thank you very much.
You will have noticed that.
Unfortunately, this has not happened.
Obviously, we cannot tolerate all that.
You can count on our cooperation.
You should have been on our side.
Tomorrow, there will be no suspense.


Admittedly, we have regrets.
Let us look at the future, then.
No, apparently not.
I listened to you again just now.
Is that the best you can do?
Is that the cream, the elite?
They are a joke!
I do not think so!
Why is this so?
Thank you for giving me the floor.
You did not heed Lenin‚Äôs advice.
I hope you will remedy this lack.

There is little to say about this list.
Not so.
Or let us take it a step further.
For me, that is more than sufficient.
Mr¬†Buttiglione was the scapegoat.
I look forward to our cooperation.
We must not become a .
Good luck in your new job.
Europe deserves a strong Commission.
I wish you every success in this task.
We are not giving you a .
I repeat, we are not giving you .
Of that work there is plenty to do.
We have given you a clear message.
We are not rubber stamps.
I wish you and your college well.
I wish you all the best.
Thank you.
Good luck, Mr Dur√£o Barroso.
Thank you very much.
We look forward to tomorrow.
¬†¬† .
I shall start with the composition.
That is what the Treaty requires.
No!
First of all, respect for the Treaties.
There is, therefore, a mechanism.
That is not our responsibility.
I believe not.
That is where the problem lies.
I would have no problem with that.
They will be difficult years.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Barroso.
I would like that to be rectified.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Toubon.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
As yet, there is no consensus.

¬†¬† .
I do not have anything to add.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you very much.
¬†¬† .
However, I understand the remarks.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I have taken note of it.
The Council is opposed to this.
¬†¬† .
Thank you for your remark.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
My reaction is the same.
That concludes Question Time.
The sole exception is Italy.
I have one final brief remark to make.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Let us be realistic and clear.
They certainly have not been told.
I wish to make five quick points.
Europe is changing.
Personally, I am convinced.
In my view that is very low.
I wish you well in your work.
I doubt very much that they could.
I will be very brief.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.
I wish them a happy stay in Strasbourg.
(1)
¬†¬† .
Let us now implement them.
Now points 5 (f) and 5 (g).
Point 5 (h).
Point 5 (i).
Point 5 (j).
Point 5 (k).
I am counting on your support.
People understand that.
It makes this institution stronger.
You will both be the stronger for it.
Some of our Members will not.
We want you to have that freedom.
¬†¬† .
Well, let us conduct a human audit.
You could not make this up!
The answer simply must be 'No'!



¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you, Mr President.
¬†¬† .
Thank you, Mr President.
Within this House we have a voice.
If not us, then who?
If not us, then who?
I hope and believe that will continue.
I welcome this Commission.
I should like to make one final point.
‚Ä¶ have affected all parties.
I suspect the latter.
Thank you very much.
That concludes voting.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This we regard as anti-democratic.
¬†¬† .
This is the real crux of the problem.
I therefore abstained.
¬†¬† .
1.
2.
3.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Mr¬†Barroso has heard our comments.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is good for this House.
These are all very positive things.
We are disappointed.
Europe needs rigour and clarity.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Who can rule the Ivory Coast?
Who can own land in the Ivory Coast?
I thank you.

¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
In short, his trial was a sham.
This is an untruth.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Dialogue has broken down.
So what is being done?
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The vote will take place next.
The debate is closed.
(1)
(2)
(3)
¬†¬† The sitting is open.
This concludes my presentation.
[Thank you very much]
Thank you very much, Mr Fabra.
I believe this is in all our interests.
Thank you.
¬†¬† .
What are the criteria?
What exactly was the impact of this?
What was the precise impact of this?
Was it useful?
That is incredibly high.
¬†¬† .
It all sounds too familiar.
It goes on and on.
Does this situation not bother anybody?
We look for some changes in the future.
It is a scandal!
The system should be better.
Well that is quite understandable.
That I can also understand.
The whole of Europe is looking at this.
I have a final point.
Let us learn a lesson from this one.

¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
What, then, is to be done?
Some of the figures are encouraging.

I presume that is still the position.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m.
All manner of ploys are used.

I shall read it out in English.
(1)
(2)
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We therefore voted in favour.
This goes to show that we were right.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Long live censorship!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
¬†¬† .‚Äì Keep everyone on file.
¬†¬† .
- Situation in Ukraine
¬†¬† .
I will be voting accordingly.
- Financial perspectives (B6-0189/2004)
¬†¬† .
Hence our abstention.
¬†¬† .

AIDS is not a distant reality.
¬†¬† .
They were as follows:
¬†¬† .
Every day 8¬†200 people die.
This is not a codecision issue.
The situation is truly very serious.
I want to make that very clear.
¬†¬† I take note of what you say.
Camera shy, but terror proud.
This situation cannot continue.
¬†¬† That concludes the speeches.
I rejoice that they are.
¬†¬† That is not a point of order.
Mr Eurlings has the floor.
First of all, human rights.
I have another three points to make.
Last but not least, Cyprus.
This does not mean discrimination.
I fully agree with this.
I welcome this.
Is this a risk you can take?
That is the question I put to you.
That it will is not a given.
The report is very clear on this point.
We are all aware of this.
That is enough: we have gone too far.
But we are taking a risk.
That is the reason for our support.
It would have merited greater emphasis.
Are our institutions ready?
As things stand, Nice is the .
What is the financial position?
Where is the financial perspective?
What has become of the British rebate?
Turkey is changing fast.
I will also mention the Cyprus issue.
Turkey is not Europe, however.
We could talk at length about Cyprus.
That is not, of course, the case.
These are non-negotiable.
¬†¬† What exactly is Turkey today?
What is Turkey?
Since when has Turkey been in Europe?
Ask your own children.
That will be a crime for Europe.
Do not commit it.
This is the crux of the matter.
I believe that this is the case here.
We are aware of the Cyprus question.
This is entirely inconsistent.
Let us not throw away that chance.
Thank you.
They have good reasons for saying this.
However, these changes were cosmetic.
Turkey is important for Europe.
The EU must also change.
We have no commitments towards Turkey.
That is not the case.
That is extortion.
The Commission says so too.
To close ...
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Vice-President.
Thank you very much.
The counter-arguments are illogical.
It is no easy task.
But I believe that we need this.
Why?
This cannot be done by compulsion.
We would be digging our own grave.
That price must not be paid.
I personally hope ...
Others put the cost much higher.
I do not share those reservations.
That does not make any sense.
Is Turkey to become a Member or not?
That is not without its problems.
Turkey ...
This is a legitimate concern.
I hear repeated calls for consistency.
What timescale would he recommend?
That needs to be said clearly.
If it does not succeed ...
He tried to square the circle.
For us, it is a matter of principle.
It is late in the debate.
I fully agree with this.
This is what we did.
¬†¬† ‚ÄìThe debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
¬†¬† .
Europass is this initiative.
It encourages and demands mobility.
That seems rather a long way off.
¬†¬† .
Thank you very much, Mr President.
I think I have said enough.
Thank you very much, .
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
This is why this debate is important.
Why is that so important?
The main question is: how?
The work has already been done.
What are our means?
The Union is not an isolated entity.
It is not a fortress.
Europe cannot be selfish.
Now is the time to get down to work.
Let that be quite clear.
This is an appalling plan.
The main obstacle is Sharon.
¬†¬† .
I will start with economic issues.
That is not the case.
I trust you will bear this in mind.
A state is a tool for all the citizens.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
Their fight can raise obstacles.
What fine strategic thinking that is!
Women constitute one such category.
I shall now make my comments.
We must stop regulating everything.
What do I mean by that?
The common rules need to be reinforced.
I can be brief about the third point.
Who knows?
I hope that you reject this opinion.
What is sustainable development?
What are we doing in Europe?
Take a look at all the statistics.
This is something we can do together.
You must succeed and we wish you well.
Ukraine needs action, not merely words.
New challenges call for new approaches.
In addition, we need security.
That reflects very well on our Europe.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
The debate is closed.
2004 has not been Belarus's best year.
In Belarus, however, it is hindered.
You have the floor.
There was direct censorship.
This was absurd.
Once again, I thank you for this award.
We insist they be returned immediately.
¬†¬† We shall now proceed to the vote.
¬†¬† .
I hope Parliament will support that.
That concludes the vote.
I voted for the proposal.

I voted for the proposal.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† We have voted against this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I am, consequently, voting in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
Section I, European Parliament
Section II, Council
Section III, Commission
Section IV, Court of Justice
Section V, Court of Auditors
Section VII, Committee of the Regions
Section VIII (A), European Ombudsman
¬†¬† .


So far, so good.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I thank you for that.
¬†¬† .
Thank you in advance.
Such is not a credible approach.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Of this, EUR 2 billion was new money.
That is indeed so.
¬†¬† .

On the Structural Funds?
A little bit everywhere?
¬†¬† .
It pays for this Parliament.
Let us look at the broader picture.
The final figure is EUR¬†106¬†billion.
¬†¬† (SK) Thank you.
Thank you.
¬†¬† .
Let me just make two points about it.
Why should I vote for this? Tell me!
Because you lot get the money!
They should not.
No!
Were they consulted?
No!
Were they given a vote?
No!
No, they would not; and neither will I.
We cannot go on like this.
It can be done.

The debate is closed.
The answer is yes.
When will that debate take place?
That is something we cannot afford.
Are there things to be dispensed with?
Where will the cuts be made?
Show your leadership.
How do you set it out?
I have six observations to make.
That, then, is why we want it.
We want a new neighbourhood policy.
Each objective deserves its own budget.
That is something I find unacceptable.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
So this is not a large amount of money.
¬†¬† . That is your opinion.
This was decided in 1957.
There will then be an open competition.
Others were amended or rejected.
It is not a threat.
¬†¬† Thank you, Madam President.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
However, I want to follow this up.
I urge you to take this very seriously.
This has been going on for years.
You mention C√¥te d'Ivoire.
I do not question them.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† . I naturally share your concern.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The first of these is credibility.
That makes sense in practical terms.
That would be a retrograde step.



¬†¬† Thank you very much.
The debate is therefore closed.

The debate is open.
Mrs¬†Lambert has the floor.
What else do we agree on?
That is also in the EU's interest.
¬†¬† .
We talk about good asylum decisions.
That is bad for all of us.
¬†¬† .
I agree with Mr Moraes.
My Group fully supports the report.
That is not the case at the moment.
It gives hope.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is entirely appropriate.
I also strongly support the amendments.
¬†¬† Thank you very much.
That concludes the list of speakers.
The debate is therefore closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
So what is that strategy to be?
It is effective.
We now need a more effective strategy.
We on this side will do so.
What is its objective?
I think we all share it.
Should we provide information?
That is a risk.
¬†¬† .


I urge you to support those amendments.
I will leave it here.
It is merely facilitation.
Is it possible to get rid of drugs?
Emphatically not.
¬†¬† Thank you very much.
That concludes the list of speakers.
¬†¬† .
What is this report about?
That is fine, of course.
That is extremely important.
Consequently we need to get it right.
¬†¬† Thank you very much.
That concludes the list of speakers.
A clear date should be indicated.
The resources must match the ambition.
Let us be clear.
We cannot tolerate such a thing.
This House is to hold a secret ballot.
Can you just be quiet?
You may speak after I have finished.
It is a scandal.
Romania will be accepted ...
You were in the chair both times.
It concerns the following.
I have another brief remark to make.
My final remark concerns terrorism.
Money is not, indeed, the EU‚Äôs only .
Where do you think cuts will be made?
Especially for those who do not pay.
I acknowledge that.
It is scandalous.
That is not democracy.
That is wrong.
Persevere!
I will now turn to Turkey.
Is that still your position now?
Will you apply zero tolerance?
Who wants to hide, and from whom?
It is by no means too late to do so.
We need action, not words.
We have to look at what we do.
Is that right?
Is it responsible?
No, it is not.
We must not take that step.
We have not managed it yet.
We cannot afford it!‚Äô
This is not yet the case.
That is true.
That is my first point.
That moment had to do with Ukraine.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
So please restrict yourself to that.
It does not say 'shall'.
The debate, Mr¬†President ‚Ä¶

It shall be secret, but electronic.
This is a matter of principle for me.
This may well be a good thing.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The EU must also change.
¬†¬† .
I voted against this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote in favour.
We cannot therefore support the report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We cannot accept such a policy.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The sitting is suspended.
This cannot be permitted.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This situation must change.
The seventh point is organised crime.
Now to the subject in hand.
I repeat, to all its neighbours.
You spoke to us of successes.
They belong among us.
To those people, I have this to say.
That is true.
I really welcome its conclusions.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
This is a long-term process.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I naturally welcome this progress.
¬†¬† .
All the chapters are closed.
That would be a very great pity.
That is one outside the European Union.
I will give you two examples.
What about qualified majority?
Parliament must take itself seriously.
This list is long and weighty.
Today we have a strategic partnership.
All we can do is hope.
¬†¬† Mr President, let me be clear.
Of course not.
I take a different view.
How soft does she want us to be?
Romania's problems run deep.
¬†¬† .
Mr President, I will be brief.
¬†¬† .
One can only agree with this.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
One of them is Interreg.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† . I agree.
That is an important point.
¬†¬† .
You will always be welcome.
It has been a very complex process.
This is what we are calling for.
Let me come straight to the point.
Let us return to the initiative.
These are just a few of the projects.
Why?
After that, the implementation begins.
There is thematic programming here.
This is what I wanted to say.
I thank you for taking it.
This will be completed by February.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
You may say it is not a big increase.
Increasing the number of volunteers.
New problems require new solutions.
Can we have a detailed report?
He went through each area in detail.
In conclusion,
I also thank you for your cooperation.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
This will apply to all journeys.
This is extremely important.
I fully agree with that.
The Commission is committed to this.
¬†¬† .
This is a very important issue.
Progress has been made.
Again, I agree with the Commissioner.
There is no disputing that.
I cannot see it as such.
I shall be more specific.
It amounts to stalemate.
I hope that you do.
That is what is important.
That worries us.
Irish cattle go to Lebanon.
This is its most positive aspect.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Animals are not commodities.
¬†¬† .
It has gone the right way.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
I can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3.
This is considered to be sufficient.
Within what limits?
Under what jurisdiction?
That is why I explicitly included it.
People would be up in arms.
Now, this is happening on the sea bed.

International waters are affected.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
(1)
It is a good thing.
¬†¬† The budget is approved.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Minister.
I shall read it in Spanish:
(2)
Overall, I voted in favour.
¬†¬† ¬†¬†Many thanks, Mr President.
¬†¬† .
That is a paragraph we cannot support.
I voted for the report.
¬†¬† .
I agree with that.
I voted for the report, of course.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† I declare the sitting resumed.
Are there any comments?
I would ask you to correct that.
Life expectancy is now 35 years.
The count has yet to be completed.
The conditions are in place, however.
That is what this is all about.
The sanctions must stop.
The debate is closed.
Europe has that experience.
So, with regret, I will abstain.
This is what we strive for.
What must we do in this House?
Much more is needed.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The rest went to the lawyers.
Experts must be involved.
What, though, was done for the victims?
The ground is still contaminated.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I wished to vote in favour.
¬†¬† Your comment has been noted.
Yesterday, we were voting until 2 p.m.
It merits our support.
We can be proud of our results.
It is a compromise.
It is not a Utopian treaty.
I am confident it will.
¬†¬† .
Today it is.
I would like to acknowledge them today.
I am very grateful indeed.
We will have more democracy.
It is now time to move up a gear.
Our work will not stop today.
In fact it is only just starting.
A constitution needs values.
I think that is quite a masterstroke.
We have many tasks ahead of us.
That is the question.
It is a European ‚Äòno‚Äô.
¬†¬† .
It is their votes that really matter.
That is demonstrably false.

Our Europe is founded upon values.

We want to retain our identity.
We want it to grow and flourish.
From now on, it must look outwards.
We still have work to do on the others.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Only history will be able to tell us.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


This is the kind of EU we need.
Why does he not mention that?
We will not do it that way!
European democracy is incomplete.
To their ‚Äòno‚Äô I say ‚Äòno‚Äô.
On that the Constitution sets its seal.
I find that unacceptable.
Constitutions are for states.
That actually sounds pretty feeble.
Thank you for your attention.

Our ‚Äòyes‚Äô is a demanding ‚Äòyes‚Äô.
Let me give you some examples.
We owe that to our citizens.
Democracy is an optional extra.
Thank you for your attention.
Their guilt is there for all to see.
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†Thank you, Mr¬†President.
He would need to be bought a new one.
This is the case in my country, Poland.
We should listen to them.

There is still time for resistance.
I recommend the minority‚Äôs amendment.
Europe deserves better.
The draft amendment rights this wrong.
This is not a document for the future.
It is something I reject.
¬†¬† We shall now proceed to the vote.
‚Äì Mr Nikiforos Diamandouros
‚Äì Mr Giuseppe Fortunato
(A secret ballot was held)
Members voting: 643
Blank or void ballot papers: 34
Votes cast: 609
Majority required: 305
The results were as follows:
Nikiforos DIAMANDOUROS 564 votes
Giuseppe FORTUNATO 45 votes
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Most people are in favour of it.
That is fantastic progress.
A new era is on the way.
What a missed opportunity, Mr Corbett!
That is people power!
Where is the truth in all of this?
You should be ashamed of yourselves!
We should be ashamed of ourselves.
‚ÄòNo‚Äô to the Constitutional Treaty!
We will be there.
Every club, every society has one.
I see it as an opportunity.
The document is not perfect.
For us, that must remain the priority.
That is most certainly what I will do.
I am about to finish, Mr President.
Thank you.
I thank you.


It was, in reality, two things.
Let me say why this is so.
Why?


I think not.
We had good grounds for this.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It takes two sides to make a debate.
However, our work cannot stop here.
Not a single ballot has yet been cast.
No means no.
I am going to vote in favour.
¬†¬† .
They seem to be twofold.
Centralised, the European Union?
That is the only power the Union has.
Some superstate!
¬†¬† .
The word 'perfect' has been mentioned.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.


I have a number of questions.
That is entirely false.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I look forward to more.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That would not be the correct approach.
Standing still is not an option.
Will the Commission address this issue?
I shall now speak in English.
Her reply has satisfied me.
I thank you once again, Commissioner.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†Many thanks.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
You have that power.
So we have a real problem.

¬†¬† .
That opportunity must now be seized.
Let us not be under any illusions.
We promised a stable currency.
I am wary of extreme solutions.
I am not under any illusions, however.
Let us decide quickly.
Let us decide now.
That is what Parliament wants to see.
Europe's prosperity is under threat.
Growth and jobs must be our priorities.
The first is the knowledge economy.
The first of these is cohesion.
¬†¬† .
It is in serious danger of stalling.
Croatia cannot duck that issue.
That is a task for your presidency.
That is the difference, Mr Poettering!
You said something very interesting.
That is something we do not want.
Had this slipped your mind?
¬†¬† .
Is that still your opinion?
Is that so, Mr¬†Juncker?
The rebate took to negotiate.
Is that the case?
I have four questions.
Obviously, that is not the case.
Finally, the fourth area.
How do you intend to work with REACH?
I therefore wish to ask four questions.


Clear sanctions are still needed.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
Let me be frank with you, Mr Juncker.
It depends on us.
Children are vulnerable to trafficking.
What should therefore be done?
I wish it every success.
I shall explain what I mean by this.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The main reason is speed.
The answer is no.
The answer is no.
I count on your support in this regard.
It is impressive!
The idea is very appealing.

¬†¬† .
The amount continues to rise.
This must be reviewed.
Our aid must be visible.
Our taxpayers demand visibility.
Ownership matters.
This does not only apply to Asia.
¬†¬† .
Would that be possible?
Thank you.
I apologise, Mr¬†President.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The Constitution is a step forward.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† We have voted against this report.
These are things to which I object.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
New social basic rights are lacking.
I do not want this Constitution.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I had hoped for better.
I voted against the resolution.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It deserves all our support.
¬†¬† You made your point.
It is not a point of order.
Thank you.
It is not a point of order.
It is spread all over the place!
Perhaps he could clean up the litter.
¬†¬† The matter is closed.
Let us proceed with the sitting.
We have done that.
I consider the whole issue closed.
There will be no more points of order.
We need to learn how to help.
There is a problem here.
This is a great opportunity.

The role of the UN is crucial here.
A number of things have been mentioned.



Let us learn our lesson one day.
What task remains?
I would like to make two suggestions.
The third point concerns food aid.
I do also have a request.
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†Thank you, Mr¬†President.
I thank you.
We are Europeans, after all.
Finally, the reconstruction.
This is about human dignity.
¬†¬† .
The best help is to save lives.
The debate is closed.
We have to work on it.
This is a significant move.
Much work remains to be done.
The Commission shares that feeling.
¬†¬† .
Together, we can achieve a lot.
¬†¬† .
Today we adopted the Constitution.
This is the first and major merit.
The people of Europe will ...
We could take a leaf out of their book.
This is not the right approach to take.
¬†¬† Many thanks, Mr¬†President.
I thank you.
I would ask you to bear this in mind.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Some examples will illustrate my point.
The resolution is extremely vague.
How much will this cost?
Developing countries are not all alike.
There are very different situations.
Within which frameworks are we to act?
¬†¬† .
I should like to respond as follows.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
Has the Council dealt with this issue?
I think that it is a good idea.
This is far from being the case.
Please excuse my poor pronunciation.
¬†¬† .
That concludes Question Time.
¬†¬† The sitting is closed.
Let me turn now to three questions.
That is a positive sign.
We very much welcome this development.
I thank you.
I can inform you of their proposals.
I thank you.
I thank you.
I thank you.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
Courage and caution are needed.
I thank you.
We cannot give our consent to this.
Ukraine will never be the same again.
What is Europe to do now?
This is also a victory for Europe.
¬†¬† The debate on Ukraine is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
From that a number of things stand out.
Over 60% of them are aged over 55.
However, it is never too late.
I doubt it.
We have heard the Commission‚Äôs reply.
In fact, that is not the case.
That is not acceptable.
That is not possible.
I thank you.
That way, you will fare much better.
The trialogue was ignored.
The second reason is legal.
This was not a restrictive procedure.
The decision was taken on that basis.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
There can be no doubt.
This will happen, have no doubt.
(1)
¬†¬† Thank you very much.
This will be done.
(2)
(3)
(4)
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I broadly support this Resolution.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
- Combat paedophilia.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Working together, we can achieve more.
¬†¬† .
Maintaining the debt is unacceptable.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is an anti-imperialist fight.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì Voting time is over.
¬†¬† The sitting is resumed.
Our demands are still on the agenda.
We return today to his case.
Only then can we expect results.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We must act with resolution.
I thank you.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place next.
But it did happen.
It is unimaginable, but it was real.
It is an evil that affects all of us.
The compromise contains two points.
I ask you to support this amendment.
¬†¬† That is the case.
I apologise for the mistake.
There are two separate amendments here.
Two separate votes are required here.
This is a point we must emphasise.
However, you did not allow me to speak.
We are voting on amendments.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I naturally voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Such obfuscation is unacceptable.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Dare one talk in terms of a thaw?
¬†¬† Mr President, I shall be brief.
I consider this to be a scandal.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is contempt for history.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I vehemently condemn such acts.
We owe them truth.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
Six million Poles died in that war.
Every individual‚Äôs life is sacred.
How did this come about?
The disabled remain forgotten.
Please forgive me.
Does that also apply to Question Time?
It was a lesson in democracy.
The day passed without incident.
This is dramatic.
That is what was heard.
There was a very poor turnout ...
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†Many thanks.
How can that be?
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
And the future does not look promising.
Nothing equates to the Nazi holocaust.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
¬†¬† Rule 27 B.
¬†¬† Did you say Rule 27 B?
¬†¬† Which Rule are you invoking?
Is that the case, Mr Tejedor?
¬†¬† You have thirty seconds.
Goodness gracious me!
Mr Barroso has the floor.
First, actions count more than words.
Take the REACH initiative, for example.
The situation is clearly disappointing.
We are ambitious, and so are you.
You have that energy.
I want to make that very clear.
Let me emphasise that.
That is in the past now.
We must make a decision.
No!
Our aim is complete consensus.
I must re-emphasise that point.
We regard this as a pernicious trend.
We also need effective public services.
That will not work.
This is vitally important.
For me it is simple.
Define the target group.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
And one more thing!
Thank you very much!
Thank you.
I should like to thank him for that.
I thank you.
That is a sensitive subject.
That is not fair.
We need a strong Commission.
We are the European institutions .
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
That is why I welcome our debate today.
It is the largest integrated market.
We must demonstrate solidarity.
I shall conclude now.
The European Union is a world player.
We must accept that responsibility.


A global tax is today being discussed.
The EU should lead the way here.

It is clearly not these things.
The message could not be clearer.
I thank you for your attention.
But even India has its downside.
What is to be done?
I see no good in such measures.
They put the cart before the horse.
Not at all.
That is our position.
This is also a shared responsibility.
The debate is closed.
We need strong measures.
Mutual trust must be stepped up.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†Many thanks, Mr¬†President.
Many thanks, Mr¬†President.
I thank you.
How can Europe provide support?
And where does the problem lie?
¬†¬† Thank you.
Thank you.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
There is no doubt about that.
That was also Mr Monti's approach.


¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†Thank you, Mr¬†President.
I thank you.
I hope that you will enjoy both.
They mark the start of our dialogue.
There is no doubt about that.
Today's debate is just the start.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Thank you.

¬†¬† Thank you Mr President.
We cannot do that.
I say: then let us change the laws.
So far, so good.
This, though, is probably not enough.
This is absolutely impracticable.
What if there is no private equivalent?
That is why timing is so essential.
I thank Mrs in 't Veld again.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† ¬†I declare the sitting open.
Yesterday I spoke here in plenary.
It made me look stupid.
I want this noted for the record.
The Union could do better.
Why invest if demand is so moribund?
Why is that the case?
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† . Mr President, thank you.
Quite the opposite!
So why is growth so poor?
They cannot both be right.
Let me analyse this.
So why is this not happening?
Go and talk to small businessmen.
It has to be taken into account.
Rules are there to be respected.
¬†¬† Thank you Mr President.
Thank you.
We have to be practical and realistic.
The Pact therefore has to be reformed.
Structural reforms, I hear you say!
Quite right!
You want everyone to work longer hours.
Europe stands to gain more from that.
We will not win the game this way.
What do we blame the ECB for?
Better late than never, though.
I am not making empty threats.
I thank you.
We show much greater pragmatism.
In short, it is a scandal.
I am strongly in favour of the Pact.
Three issues should be kept in mind.
Many thanks.
They have done their homework.
We want to see the correct reforms.
What is the European dimension?
Just listen, please!
You know I am right.
Six percentage points!
That difference no longer exists.
¬†¬† .
What are we doing?
Governance is very important.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Try to help us do honour to this idea.
¬†¬† .
Currently, 70% of us live in cities.
A global digital networked environment.
¬†¬† .
I appreciate their help.
¬†¬† .
We shall study this view in detail.
What is to be done?
That is vital.
¬†¬† Your request is accepted.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
Thank you.
¬†¬† .
Provide is to run or monitor.
¬†¬† .
That is what I am saying.
I think that would be clearer.
I shall read the amendment in English.
¬†¬† .
That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
¬†¬† .
I congratulate the rapporteur.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Overloaded bureaucracy?
That is purely a national problem.
It is perfect.
Thank you for your attention.
¬†¬† .
It has become a constant battle.
It has therefore become a burden.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We really need to go further.
On the ground, we only wanted ‚Ä¶
Sadly, it seems not.
That is patently stupid.
Wiser counsels know this is impossible.
Has anybody asked the bats?
No, of course not.
You could even call it batty!
But there is a need for guarantees.
We need a special fund.
Thank you very much for your attention.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
I thank you.
This is common sense.
This is also common sense.
Is this common sense?
An obvious example is smoking.
Is this what we are doing?
Not quite!
This is definitely not common sense.
Allow me to mention three points.
¬†¬† Thank you, Madam President.
Less development means less health.
Forgive me for being sceptical.
We have to be frank about this.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
¬†¬† .
This situation is no longer acceptable.
That is not to be tolerated.
We tried it in Denmark, and it worked.
The world did not come to an end.
The idea is a good one.

Thank you very much.
I thank you.
Is the Commission aware of this?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is my answer to Mr Purvis
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I am here, opposite you.

¬†¬† .
I have listened to your proposal.
¬†¬† . Thank you for the question.
However, I would like to give you ...
We cannot leave this to subsidiarity.
And that is going too far.
Thank you.
That is not the case.
I thank you.
Congratulations, Mr Grosch!
That is what I wanted to say.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
I would simply like to add a few words.
The figures speak for themselves.
This is three thousand too many!
¬†¬† .
However, this report says more.
Where do they dump the other 93%?
Most of it in the sea, probably.
Thank you.
Let us continue to use them.

Why?
How will you, Commissioner, enforce it?

That was the point I wished to make.
He has no right to misquote me.
¬†¬† . I apologise.
The debate is closed.
The directive serves a dual purpose.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
SMEs and consulting are very important.
Can you deliver on this, Commissioner?
What remains to be done?
There is a great deal to be done here.
That was the point I wanted to make.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
The Commission can accept Amendment 1.
The Commission can accept Amendment 3.
The Commission can accept Amendment 6.
The Commission can accept Amendment 17.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is known as a beneficial crisis.



It was a good idea.

That would help ensure compliance.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Many thanks, Commissioner.
Thank you for your attention.
Let me say a brief word now on Lebanon.
We have several ways forward.
I believe that is what we must ‚Ä¶
Those statements are unambiguous.
I thank you.
Prompt action is therefore required.
My answer is yes.
Yes.
My answer is clear, it is yes.
Yes, and they have started to do so.
That is my question to the Council.
The question is crucial.
Europe needs to be more committed.
My third comment concerns Iraq.
The price we all paid was enormous.
Let us disarm it in our soft way.
How should we do this?
Let us stick with Resolution 1559.
We have a shared future.
What are those signals?
The prospects have rarely been so good.
However, the impact is positive.
The other side must make an effort too.
I gave both leaders this clear message.
I particularly wanted to mention that.
I have already announced this.
We hope we can make progress.
All this must be done in parallel.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Some decisions have already been taken.
These are three essential subjects.
We reserve the right to a final vote.
The approach needs to be discarded.
These are serious considerations.
This leads me to make two comments.
Conditions in Zimbabwe are appalling.
That is respect for human rights.
¬†¬† The debate is suspended.
The debate will resume at 3 p.m.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Before the vote:
¬†¬† (1).
Thank you, all of you.
Dear friends, we are here together.
We are now united by shared values.
We have a shared history.
We have shared aspirations.
There was a lot of corruption.
Nobody can do that work for us.
This is clearly one of our priorities.
Dear friends, nothing is guaranteed.
Thank you very much.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr¬†Yushchenko.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Our explanation of vote is very simple.
¬†¬† . Brussels loves agencies.
Yet who will those observers be?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted against the report.


The first is that of Colombia.
China was also mentioned.
These are real sanctions.
Belarus has also been mentioned.
¬†¬† .
This is the case with China.
I wish to continue in English.
There are some very interesting ideas.
He has our full support.
The debate is closed.
I said all of that to them personally.
This was mentioned again yesterday.
There is now room for this.
Its railway system is broken in two.
For them there truly can be none.
Ukraine has set a precedent.
¬†¬† ‚ÄìThank you Mr President.
Thank you.
You want to subjugate Moldova.
We talked about it at length yesterday.
At the time there was a .
This was said yesterday.
But let us not to go too far.
Let us act.
Please look at the action plan.
The debate is closed.
Outlawed.
We are not and must not feel alone.
I thank you.
Now is the time to act.
¬†¬† .
This is a truly fundamental question.
¬†¬† .
I thank you.
That is 24¬†000 too many.
Mr¬†Zapatero has kept his promise.
There are three reasons for this.
Secondly, the objective is attainable.
Thank you for your attention.
We talk, we debate, we wring our hands.
If you cannot buy local, buy regional.
That will be a real test of our mettle.
It is time now for action.
You are right in one respect.
The debate is closed.
A new situation has therefore arisen.
I think this is a very important issue.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
Time is of the essence.
When will this, at long last, be done?
We have had ten years to adapt.

Imports of pullovers increased by 613%.

There are two possible objectives.
That is all true.



¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† . I do not have much to add.
He sent out a rather different signal.
¬†¬† . Yes, I will.
¬†¬† .
This is a most fundamental issue.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
That is to be welcomed.
That is a good step forward.
I thank you all.
This is a good thing.
Good news, then, and complete success.
We have chosen the right path.
It must ban unfair practices.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Thousands of lives have been saved.
I therefore ask for your support.
My group will support the report.
¬†¬† . Mr President,
I know: I have teenagers.
I had to make my son quit the job.
I know, I have been one for 30 years.
The economic cost is equally vast.
It is very good that this should be so.
I can agree with all of that.
I cannot support either attempt.
It was a good try, though.
¬†¬† () Good evening everyone!
¬†¬† .
This means 5 000 more human tragedies.
I thank you.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
We seem to have seen it all before.
Are we perhaps maligning the company?
The sooner we do that, the better.
Is this all no more than a dead letter?

It is time for action, not words.
Let me remind you of some.
What do I mean by 'more'?
Let me say two things in closing.
Is this social dialogue?
Is this the Europe we want?
We have an obligation to do that.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
Can this fine ambition be achieved?
How it is going to be achieved?
Now for the third suggestion.
Let me explain.
The answer is yes.
I am very grateful for these questions.
Enlargement is one particular issue.
Let me make an important addition here.
Both factors are needed.
That is the only way we can succeed.
The time for delivery is now.
Their effort is necessary.
That is why I ask for your support.
The problem is the Member States.
I therefore ask:
I would like to add something else.
I thank you.
Public funding is not the only funding.
Environment is crucial.
First, cooperation.
The second area is ideas.
That will be more transparent.
The third area should be people.
They are doing that already.
Thank you for your support.
The debate is closed.
Let me turn to the amendments.
We can accept Amendments Nos 4 and 5.

That is what we must help them with.
Secondly: the practicalities.
This would make it a better proposal.






I thank you.
Understandably, we want to help.
This proposal is well-intentioned.
Many thanks.
First, the question of the calculation.
Incidentally, they are not small boats.
The needs will be assessed by the FAO.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
That is not helpful.
They do not want these boats.
Is that it?
Does he want to repeat the terms?
We are clearly opposed to it.
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†Thank you, Mr¬†President.
I thank you.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Accordingly, I voted in favour.
I saw at first hand the devastation.
Lend them the labour, by all means.
I completely agree with Mr Evans.
This statement explains my decision.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is the first consideration.
Consequently, I voted in favour.
There are two conditions for that.
That is a step in the right direction.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†Many thanks, Mr¬†President.
Many thanks, Mr¬†President.
Access to them has been restricted.
A military solution is not the answer.
A few have been released since then.
¬†¬† .¬†¬†¬†Many thanks.
I thank you.
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†Thank you, Mr¬†President.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
This agreement secures good governance.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place next.
This is a tidying-up exercise.
No amendment has been proposed.
That is very important.
¬†¬† This is a complicated issue.
We shall proceed to the vote.
I wish to make two points.
¬†¬† Which Rule are you invoking?
¬†¬† Mr President, this is new.
¬†¬† Mr Harbour, please sit down.
You do not have the floor.
At 12.30 p.m., the vote.
That is an absolute disgrace!
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Harbour.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mrs Gomes.
It wrecks lives and families.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Bowis.
I have taken good note of your request.
We shall deal with it.
There is no other way to do this.
The law is the law.
Thankfully things are much better now.
¬†¬† .
Can that be done?
Defaults have been minimal.
What is the EIB?
The EIB plays a crucial role in this.
This is extremely bad news.
I thank you.
For my part, I am delighted about it.
This is a productive dialogue.
Nevertheless, we remain open.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Who else is meant to do it?
Why is this so?
There are two main reasons.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
There is a great discrepancy here.
Consequently, we need to do more.
Is everyone a loser?
When will this change, Commissioner?
Consumption is rising.
We have industry that requires energy.
Mr¬†President, energy is power.
They are not a sound way of proceeding.
One or perhaps both.
¬†¬† .
We have a directive on biofuel.
We have to do something.
Green energy is not a loss leader.
The fact is that their ideological ‚Ä¶
Yes, Mr Swoboda, now just listen to me.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
That threatens safety.
Many thanks.
I now have to speak on the amendments.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
We think we have to say yes.
What is this debate about?
That is when the problem started.
The wording is important.
We only have to do the maths.
Let me explain.
Benefits are part of taxation systems.
We respect their stance.
That is a real step forward.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
Nevertheless, we need to face facts.
It is all a matter of ownership.
¬†¬† .

First of all comes better lawmaking.
It needs a clear political direction.
To put it another way, we can do it.
We can learn from one another.
Time is not on our side.
Such is now our common task.
All these things we have achieved.
That, for us, is the starting point.
There are many reasons for this.
My conclusion is the opposite.
Growth is worse.
Where has the GBP¬†75¬†billion gone?
I thank you.
My warm thanks go to them all.
Be careful!
That is what we are working to do.
What do we have to do?
What does that mean?

We have no choice.
This brings me to my second point.
The euro has not kept its promise.
That was a weakness in the proposal.
Moreover, this is how it should be.
Is that possible?
Yes, it is.
My youngest daughter is nine years old.
Today we worked out our priorities.
This House is right behind you.
We do not need a directive to do that.
What must we not do?
What Mrs Doyle just said is correct.
This is something we must implement.
Thank you for your attention.
It would be a waste of time.
That is no solution.
You must agree that is a joke.
It is not realistic.
It may create a genuine new momentum.
I am pleased about that.
It wants to work with you.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.
I will therefore do as you ask.
I voted for the report.
They include the following;
¬†¬† .
I voted for the report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
As I have always advocated:
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes voting time.
The sitting is suspended.

This requires more than just words.
We need shared budgetary discipline.
If not, they serve no purpose.
In my view, the answer is no.
This report is highly critical.
What exactly do we want?
Thank you.
Thank you.
It is almost too good to be true.
¬†¬† .
These two go together.
Of course the Stability Pact is wrong.
It is useless!
Dump it!
So why do we do this in the Pact?
One deficit is not the same as another.
¬†¬† .
That is important.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
They should be released immediately.
The situation is Kafkaesque.
The EU can do more.
How can the situation now be remedied?
I propose the following three steps.
I agree fully with Mr¬†Muscat.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Does he agree with that?
That much is clear.
¬†¬† Question No 2 lapses.
Question No 3 has been withdrawn.
So, what are we going to do about it?
That is the question.
There is a 'pull' effect in play.
That time is certainly drawing nearer.
That is the programme.
Should there not be some coordination?
What action is taken against them?
That is very clear.
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†Many thanks, Mr¬†President.
I have both good and bad news for you.
You referred to other countries.
Is he still there?
That is a question I cannot answer.
That concludes Question Time.
I could not agree more.
It is time to do something.
It would, and should, be widely heard.
Even then, that is not enough.
That is why this is a crucial area.
And so on.
There are many such questions.
I thank you.
Research is done by people.
I will continue in Swedish.
I thank you.
Many thanks, Mr¬†President.
I thank you.
I should like to make three points.
¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†Thank you, Mr¬†President.
I have five proposals.
I thank you.
As I said, it has become a necessity.
The fourth is capacities.
It is true that they are not easy.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
I should like to complain about that.
That is why we are here tonight.
What is happening with it now?
Have you checked this?
I should like to have precise answers.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The procedure is extremely vague.
In other words, why is it necessary?
It has never been proven that it is.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in April.
The amount is not up for negotiation.
This type of behaviour must be stopped.
No, they must pay for this themselves.
¬†¬† .
There was very little time to consider.
Natura 2000 is a case in point.
¬†¬† .¬†¬†¬†Many thanks, Mr¬†President.
I thank you.
Why is this?
Because the document itself is poor.
How would it be funded?
We need to ratify the position.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
¬†¬† I take note of what you have said.
The subject is a complex one.
We have to offer them a clear outlook.
This will offset the loss in revenue.
I am currently exploring those ideas.
Let me conclude with the timetable.
In fact, quite the reverse is true.
Nevertheless, imports will increase.
They are no solution.
That is a profoundly odd point of view.
Yet who will profit from this reform?
Will it be the farmers?
Perhaps it will be the consumers?
Thank you.
That should not happen.
Everyone must play his or her part.
Why is this resolution so good?
What does this add up to?
I do not share this belief.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you Mr President.
We are threatened with a sugar fine.
That would be good news.
I thank you for your attention.
That is utterly out of the question.
I leave you with one last thought.
The debate is closed.
Thank you.
Many people were killed.
We must redouble our efforts.

I thank you.
It is ‚Äòstraight banana‚Äô time again!
Why?
This must not happen.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.
I voted in favour, of course.
I voted in favour of the report.
Nothing has happened!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That has to stop.
It is a despicable practice.
I voted in favour.
No mention is made of these issues.
I voted in favour.
This could have serious consequences.
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
Many issues have yet to be resolved.
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
The second aspect is Lisbon.
I voted in favour.
The visit taught us a great deal.
I refer to the subjugation of Tibet.
The question is: is this enough?
We see nothing of that at present.
That test is one that the EU must pass.
I beg to differ.
There can be no question of autonomy.
Thank you, Mr¬†President.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr¬†President.
Thank you.
What can be done?
I have sent in letters on the subject.
They are being damaged for life.
There is no alternative.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr¬†President.
They can be found in every workplace.
Thank you.
I sincerely hope so.
There followed happy times for Poland.
The same should happen now.
I truly believe it could happen.
I am not sure that it is too severe.
The country deserves a better future.
I thank you.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We need to act resolutely in this case.
I would kindly ask you to forgive me.
His conclusion is simply depressing.
We should be able to say so.
¬†¬† Thank you.
Many activists are now under arrest.
Corruption is widespread.
Thank you.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We have come a long way.
It is shameful.


¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place next.
¬†¬† We will now move to the vote.
No amendments have been proposed.
Nobody.
Does anybody wish to speak against?
¬†¬† Of course.
A point of order.
I should like this to be recorded.
I am very sorry.
No amendments have been proposed.
Mr Salafranca.
Does anybody wish to speak against?
¬†¬† One moment please, Mr De Grandes.
You may leave the Chamber if you wish.
Go ahead, Mr De Grandes.
Mr De Rossa.
Mr Tannock has the floor.
We have problems with competitiveness.
Non-proprietary goods are not selling.
They go to the coast on the other side.
¬†¬† I have taken note of your request.
Mr Pek has the floor.
Mr Medina Ortega has the floor.
I am going to give you the floor.
That is what Rule 145 says.
¬†¬† Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr Medina.
There are several oral questions.
Mr Cavada has the floor.
Finally, we need more credibility.
We need more in the way of Europe.
That is a lot!
Next, fundamental rights.
It is a slippery slope.
The two cannot be put asunder.
There is a serious imbalance, however.
Why?
How did they get those names?
I have not heard anything about it.
Thank you.
That is why we want the programme.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
Mr¬†Frattini has the floor again.
Our proposal has two main elements.
¬†¬† .
Action on this by the EU is overdue.
I do not question that.
Our group rejects such a solution.
¬†¬† .
We shall be voting in favour.
There is a great deal more to do.
I think I can work with him‚Äô.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
What should we be visualising?
What is the point of them?
What do we need them for?
It is also feasible.

It simply makes no sense at all.
The first aim is to simplify the rules.
Is that even technically possible?
Let me give you two examples.
Those, then, are the three aims.
Let me move on now to enforcement.
My last point concerns roadside checks.
So heaven help our truckers!
Does Labour represent them any more?
‚ÄòInappropriate‚Äô to give a UK view?
Private vehicles will possibly be next.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Rack.
Mr de Grandes has the floor.
This is about road safety.
That is very important.
Annex - Commission‚Äôs position
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate on this item.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Why?
So what do we need?
Ships pollute to some degree.
Bold subsidies are needed.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
¬†¬† The sitting is closed.
Firstly, the Stability and Growth Pact.
Their response was favourable.
What are the issues here?
On that we are absolutely agreed.
On that we are absolutely agreed.
Where is the sense of common purpose?
Europe needs and deserves better.
We see that as a serious mistake.
That is not what we want.
We do not accept it.
Lazarus indeed strikes once more.
But it is not living, it is fudging.
Mr Barroso echoed those statements.
We have an election in the UK on 5 May.
Our Union is in a strange situation.
That is also our line.
However, I am still very worried.
Uncertainty is very expensive.
The second policy area is energy.
You have to be tougher, Mr Juncker.
Nor do its citizens want it to.
It has actually been a total failure.
Please, take a brief look back with me.
You are right.
We have more work to do in this regard.
Allow me to point out four things.
It is too easy to be pessimistic.
It is not.
What do I mean by this news item?
We are now called upon to go further.
Now we shall manage it.
That might be one message.

That is my observation!

Something must be wrong.
Why was this necessary?
I represent the European Council.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
I cannot find this in the list.
¬†¬† .
That is a major success.
‚Äò1.
a.
b.
‚Äò2.
3.
This is the only plausible way forward.
¬†¬† .
I am not that naive.
That will apply to all four texts.
They are grown-ups.
We are therefore proposing that ...
We must not send out a message that ...
¬†¬† .
It is a project. It is a common desire.
¬†¬† My apologies, Mr¬†President.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is a gross waste of public funds.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Parliament should follow suit.
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Why all of these words?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
That is good news.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I am in favour of future enlargements.
This needs to be remedied.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Our constituents expect nothing less.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We shall see the Council‚Äôs position.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
These manoeuvres are absurd.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Did you like the Bolkestein directive?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We are at a real watershed.
I hope to be able to do so next month.
The EU is ready, once Croatia is ready.
¬†¬† (Thank you Mr President.
Thank you.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
Why is there unemployment?
¬†¬† .
They are chiefly weak states.
It is as simple as that.
The debate is closed.
I remember precisely what was said.
We cannot act outside its framework.
It is a good concept.
¬†¬† .

I will deal with just one aspect.
Two points nonetheless.
Polemics have had their day.
We need to face up to that fact.
Military capacity is essential.
That is defending the indefensible.
It is not only a problem in Bosnia.
Let us work together on that basis.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
We are working towards this.
¬†¬† .
They were rather exceptional reasons.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Let me answer Mr Evans.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is an issue that affects many of us.
I wonder if you could supply one?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Please answer and do not say nothing.
¬†¬† I turn to the Minister.
¬†¬† .
There is a certain logic.
It seems that they are now in a bind.
That would be unfair on that country.
You have two choices.
Who is elected?
That concludes Question Time.
What is this about?
It was good for the whole of Europe.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Why?
¬†¬† .
This is the ugly face of capitalism.
¬†¬† .
It does not stop there.
We should not allow this to happen.
There is cross-party support for this.
I believe that the WTO should act.
¬†¬† .
If so, they run against WTO rules.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Good evening, Mr President.
The EU has a common trade policy.
Such issues are regulated by the WTO.
That is called tax dumping.
That is known as environmental dumping.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
If so, what was the outcome?
That is true.
We need at least 100.
I want an investigation into this.
It is not good enough.
The answer is that they did not.
VAT is one example of this.
This is also true of individuals.
They have given all they could.
Our demands are not unreasonable.
I refer to China and India.
What is the truth today?
At least we thought that way then.
What is the truth today?
Thank you for your attention.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Let me now turn to the core issues.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The problem is two-fold.
Consequently:
¬†¬† .
The objections to doping are threefold.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12¬†noon.
What does this mean?
¬†¬† Thank you Mr President.
Thank you.
The resolution is very clear.
¬†¬† .
Anything you care to name is on there.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We cannot overstate this principle.
¬†¬† .
It comprises five chapters.
¬†¬† .
Long may they continue to fish!
¬†¬† .
This is one of those rare occasions.
I, for one, share that approach.
I cannot accept Amendment 30.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
This simply involves an update.
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
It is a modern form of colonialism.
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Therefore I vote against the report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .



Other measures are required, though.
One of our themes was climate change.
Sometimes it takes application.
Now is the time for action, then.
The figures are clear.
¬†¬† .
This is an intolerable situation.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What are we doing about that?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
We came home and they stayed there.
European interests are at stake.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately.
¬†¬† We shall now proceed to the vote.
There has been a technical glitch.
That has gone astray for some reason.
You do a similar thing in your report.
This is long-term work, we know.
We cannot go down that road.
We can only welcome that.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I thank Mr Coveney.
¬†¬† .
No¬†one can be sure of such a thing.
Now of course many have been released.
It is the law of the genre.
Let us look at some examples.
The rest, however, remains unsaid.
I hope so.
One abuse cannot justify another.
Another motive is nationality.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
Let me give a number of examples.
This is after all a people issue.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
This solution may take various forms.
¬†¬† .
Where do they occur?
The problem is very often much broader.
It begins with the lack of education.
Together, we have to break it.
That amounts to one tenth of them.
So what must be done?
We must address both issues.
I applaud the resolution.
The debate is closed.
Thank you.
How can it be possible?
I thank you.
I therefore welcome it wholeheartedly.
¬†¬† .
That is a fact.
We are also living longer.
What can he do to reinforce it?
It provides security.
Modernisation is required.
The patient is a customer.
Basically, there is no health policy.
Healthcare should not be a commodity.
Both issues are of major importance.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
I thank you.
I commend the report to the House.
I thank you.
It happens to us all.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
But that is really not my cup of tea.
We address similar priorities.
Thirdly, effective consultation is key.
¬†¬† .
What wisdom did it bestow?
The one must not wreck the other.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
There is no risk of monopoly.
It will attract investors‚Äô interest.
I believe in institutional competition.
I have two suggestions to make.
Here is the first.
Europe is in urgent need of it.
What problems have become apparent?
What action do we need to take?
Last week I was in the United States.
They offer a range of approaches.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11 a.m.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11 a.m.
¬†¬† .
I was keen to point this out.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Those are my points.
Why has it not happened?
¬†¬† .
The Commission regrets this approach.
¬†¬† .
Nonetheless, there are still some gaps.
This directive is needed.
It is one or the other.
¬†¬† .
Just a quick second point.
They have failed to do so up to now.
I shall go one step further.
Farmers also need and want clean water.
It may well do more harm than good.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
¬†¬† .
Thank you for your attention.
I hope we all belong to this group.
What should we do?
¬†¬† .
The consumer is not being listened to.
Thank you.
They cannot be separated out.
The record on this varies considerably.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place in a moment.
The Commissioner himself was here.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
Thank you.
¬†¬† .
That is why I tabled Amendment¬†3.
Is that correct, General Morillon?
You lost that one, General!
Would you mind repeating it?
to replace by text
Was that your point, Mr Purvis?
¬†¬† That was my point, Mr President.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is politically inept.
Why is this so?
I, myself, was one of those who did so.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Schulz.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Among many examples, the report:
Furthermore, it:
I will give five examples of this.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That has not been the case, however.
Miss Skride, your violin has the floor.
No amendments have been proposed.
No amendments have been proposed.
However, what happened was a disgrace.
No amendments have been proposed.
You will receive it very shortly.
No amendments have been proposed.
That is reprehensible.
¬†¬† That concludes this item.
We welcome them to our debate.
¬†¬† .
It is a call for real peace.
Time will tell.
I commend the resolution to the House.
We will fight to the very end.
However, it is now out in the open.
They fear the truth.
The IRA is not the law!
They are in my prayers.
This was a foul murder.
Hence the IRA-enforced wall of silence.
It should do so immediately.
I welcome them here today.
They have refused.
They too must be condemned.
The facts are sobering.
I support both those ideas.
I commend this motion to the House.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
Who are we then to claim the opposite?
¬†¬† .
This is where opinions differ.
¬†¬† .
This is what we call common sense.
That is not a good idea.
¬†¬† .
There are obviously two problems.
I wish this directive well.
Is it safe or not?
We are well used to it.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Frankly, this is not good enough.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Europe is the cradle of the cinema.

My theory is as follows.
Everybody must play their role.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
I shall give you some examples.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


That is my first answer.
I will now answer the second question.
I want to be clear on this question.
It is not merely an opinion.
Not much actually happened, though.
We do not have that much time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
Who is actually paying for what?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That does not aid our competitiveness.
Terrorism is a terrible thing.
Œ§he ESŒ°S is tapping telephone calls.
We have terrorism and fear of terror.
So let us protect our citizens.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you also for your brevity.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will take place at noon today.
Why?
What about flexibility though?
That is what we see now.
Each of the Member States is different.
Each has its own economic structure.
¬†¬† .
It has.
¬†¬† .
The stakes are nonetheless important.
¬†¬† .
It is a health and safety issue.
But the opt-out is a big issue for us.
We are turning the clock back 85 years.
It is a mockery.
One day, three days, three weeks?
¬†¬† .
This is a minimum directive.
Can we do without a minimum directive?
That is the first thing.
I have talked to all of them.

That is simply not true.
The issue is: who should decide?
It is excessive and wrong.
How many and how detailed must they be?
And, if so, why?
And what right do we have to do so?
Please take your conversation outside.
That includes Mr Rasmussen and others.
We should work to preserve this model.
Nobody is saying that we should not.
So let us use common sense.
That is not the way forward for Europe.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is voting time.
¬†¬† .
I was shocked.
We are very grateful.
They can be proud of their country.
¬†¬† .
and
¬†¬† .
I have two concerns.
¬†¬† .
This would be confusing for the public.
We acknowledge that.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
There can be no exceptions.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I wish I could be just as optimistic.
I wish you much success in Bonn.
We do need to do something.
We have, then, really only just begun.
That is not enough.
We should take steps forward.
Targets were mentioned.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
This project must be stopped.
We should not deceive ourselves.
Another consideration is this.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.

I would like to make a final comment.
I look forward to working with him.
However, I have some comments.
Which planet do they live on?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
That is a step forward.
That applies to many areas.
That cannot be allowed.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
They may be reapplied if need be.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you for that response.
¬†¬† .
Others have agreements with each other.
¬†¬† .
Of that there is no doubt.
¬†¬† .
Why is he quoting a constitution?
What is wrong with the Treaty?
I would like to say the following:
¬†¬† .
They know what they are required to do.
¬†¬† .
That is the situation.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We try to do it in different ways.
You did that successfully in Spain.
We are grateful to Spain for that.
You set an example.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The conclusion is clear.
Never mind the cynics!
¬†¬† .
You need to respond instantly.
¬†¬† .
We have started a rebuttal service.
We are engaged in a rebuttal service.
I agree that it is very important.
¬†¬† .
We cannot impose further demands.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We need that park.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I listened carefully to your comments.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
So this is all possible.
¬†¬† .
We discussed this many times.
We consulted on those issues.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Perhaps I was not clear enough.
¬†¬† .
It requires good communication.
Important regional issues are involved.
¬†¬† .
Nobody is perfect, as we know.
We all make mistakes.
It is a good sector to support.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The first is better regulation.
¬†¬† .
All this work has started.
This is extremely important.
I can give you only a general answer.
¬†¬† .
That concludes Question Time.
Their expertise will be very valuable.
These are part of the same proposals.
That is, I believe, a happy augury.
My apologies for this.
The definition is clear.
I consider this worth a debate.
Let me clarify that.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
21 amendments must be rejected.
¬†¬† .

That, in itself, is a sound approach.
¬†¬† .

At least that will be clear.
You can do it.
That is not protectionism.
More good approaches are required.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
I will try to give a short explanation.
I would emphasise ‚Äì in rural areas.
Is this an effective and rational way?
This kind of attitude is unacceptable.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Peacekeeping remains the key issue.
They will not cooperate.
People are suffering.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


They could have done so.
¬†¬† .
No doubt the rhetoric will continue.
Why am I saying all this?
What we need is a balance.
This requires joint action.
We also need coherence.
Let us head for the future .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We should make this a new priority.
What is our objective?
The truth is rather different, however.
That situation must end.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† .
, you have the floor.
That is an illusion.
They are actually very different. [...]
Thank you for your attention.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This principle is not disputed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The European Union?
In particular:
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
However, we do not have any illusions.
¬†¬† .
It even includes some backward steps.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
They aren't.
8¬†May¬†1945 was also a day of defeat.
We ought never to forget.
What losses!
They were not liberated.

How many lost opportunities!
Let us first look at the past.
We therefore remember.
Hardly any country emerged unscathed.
Some found it simply by returning home.
Churchill was right.
What he said was astonishing.
We should not forget what Europe was.
Why?
I never saw him.
Europe‚Äôs wars became world wars.
We are alive.
We made it; the Nazis did not.‚Äô
So many victims, so many names!
Three names out of 55 million victims!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
My parents left Germany 72 years ago.
We have to talk about crimes.
So the Chinese get a few weapons.
So they are sold a few Transrapids.
¬†¬† .
Thank God!
If I may quote him.
Yet this admission came too late.
Why is this so important right now?
I quote:
Our history is your history too.
That must be our guiding light.
What war has it stopped?
Does federation guarantee peace?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
It will not succeed!
¬†¬† Question No 1 has been withdrawn.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I must confess, I cannot blame them.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Is the Council aware of these facts?
¬†¬† .
What are we doing?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you for that answer.
This is a serious issue.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I have two follow-up questions.
¬†¬† .
Let us begin with the Euratom Treaty.
¬†¬† .
What specific demands do you have?
Have you set a timetable?
¬†¬† .
I have no comments to make.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I find this very heartening.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Why can we not see it?
Please give us an answer!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Question No 21 has been withdrawn.
¬†¬† .
This work is very encouraging.
¬†¬† .
That concludes Question Time.
¬†¬† That is noted, Mr Crowley.
I will discuss these four policy areas.
The respective increases are 6% and 4%.
¬†¬† .
What is so special about 2006?
The item is closed.
¬†¬† .
It requires continual development.
That is a matter of dispute.
That is my clarification.

The President has written to Mr Martin.
I do not want to pursue this now.
You must not say that.
I am very grateful to you.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
That is just by the by.
¬†¬† .

That will be the key issue.

I have three general points.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
This is just a road map, however.
¬†¬† .
This has to change.
We made progress in Paris.
Let me finish there.
This should not happen again.
¬†¬† .
We must re-examine this issue.
I have faith in you.


How can such an idea be asserted?
¬†¬† .
I do not share their idealism.
It is not a simple matter.

I can assure you of that.
That is not what he meant.
But it is coming towards us.
I say that for two reasons.
I think that impatience is healthy.
And I reject that.
Of course trade is not some magic wand.
I think that is very important.
Let me finish on this point.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
¬†¬† .
These are important issues.
Now many have.
This is being undertaken.
¬†¬† .
That is a good start.
What do you propose to do about it?
It is a matter of cause and effect.
¬†¬† .
That is the right approach.
So his approach is correct.
What are the real interests at stake?
There is no making up for lost time.
What exactly do you mean by this?
Please do not let them down any longer.
September might be too late.
a) high-quality innovative products,
Why?
So it is a mixed picture.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Amen.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is not very clear.
None of us can do it on our own.
That is a good start!
¬†¬† Ladies and gentlemen,
Thank you for your attention!
What is the cause of this?
That is what we must aim for.
¬†¬† .
This is something for all players.
Thank you for the debate.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon.
I regard this as unacceptable.
¬†¬† I note your statement.
¬†¬† We shall now proceed to the vote.
Legal action will be taken.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you, colleagues.
I congratulate our colleagues here.
Our resolution opens the way for that.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Fascism was born of capitalism.
¬†¬† .
We cannot.
If we want peace, we need the truth.
I have therefore chosen to abstain.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The rapporteur is right.
World trade is not fair.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It also overlooks opposing opinions.
That is a good start!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Let us therefore take this on board.

We are counting on you.
I cannot keep so much livestock.
I want to say something more.
It is May, and it has not rained.
Why?
¬†¬† .
I have now confirmed this.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Incidents of violence ensued.

¬†¬† .

We vote in favour of the resolution.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
I wish them all the best.
This is also a matter of democracy.
Democracy is not just about voting.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
UN diplomatic measures are also needed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
¬†¬† We shall now proceed to the vote.
I would like to welcome Mrs Blumenthal.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Mayor Oreja.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Moraes.
It is clearly a problem for this House.
Thank goodness for !
We all hope that he will.
It can be done and it should be done!
¬†¬† One moment, please.
¬†¬† . Thank you, Mr President!
What is the European Parliament for?
It happens time and again.
Let me explain why.
This is a malicious allegation.
I well understand his difficulty.
We started a debate about hospitality.
¬†¬† .
I have still not been given that list.
‚ÄòEUR¬†120,‚Äô she said.
That list is now at Bonde.com.
It matters to me.
You are sending out the wrong messages.
Wake up, I beg of you!
I just cannot accept that.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
I am very sorry.
That is the real wealth of our Union.
¬†¬† .
It is a complex process.
¬†¬† .
It is now time to get to work.
¬†¬† .
This is a step in the right direction.
¬†¬† .
I hope for a positive vote tomorrow.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
This concerns us all.
There is no internal conflict.
This should be the aim.
¬†¬† .
The answer is still in the negative.
We are laying down conditions here.
And rightly so.
Why the double standards?
And rightly so.
¬†¬† .
Thank you, Mr President.
¬†¬† .
We must continue in this direction.
These are concrete actions.
¬†¬† .
I have heard this in a different way.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Our Union is entering a new phase.
¬†¬† .
These are not the actions of democrats.
Let me say two things.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
¬†¬† .
The agency can be none of those things.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
This is what has happened in Belarus.
It is a controversial issue that ...
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
We agreed on a compromise of 25%.
Money laundering ‚Ä¶
There is no interpretation!
No way.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


We find this regrettable.
He has done a very good job.
¬†¬† .
Many thanks, Mr¬†Nassauer.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
Because what do we find?
I think that is a great shame.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Why do we need legislation?
That agreement is not enough, however.
We must therefore have tests.
¬†¬† .
I hope that my fellow Members do so.
¬†¬† .
I wish to thank you on their behalf.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
If you do not know, come back.
Let me explain.
¬†¬† .
The solution is much more complex.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
That is very important.
That is why we presented this proposal.
¬†¬† .
What is this regulation about?
I have three points.
It is overregulation.
Of course advertisements must not lie!
No one wants that.
Deception comes in many forms.
The second point concerns alcohol.
Nutrient profiles can be very useful.
I know that Member States use them.
That is why we need clear legislation.
We have to be credible here.
Well, many of us have done so.
And so we should.
This demands a very strong response.
We must take action here.
You cannot live without salt or sugar.
This is a very sensible option.
That is a very simple matter.
We are not banning advertising.
Notification is not enough.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
I regret I cannot accept Amendment 6.
¬†¬† .
In this case I hope it does.
That has to be avoided.
This is an area of great concern.
I think this will be sufficient.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
That was more than speculation.
This is certainly being examined.
I have just one more point to make.
There is competition.
It depends on what the market is doing.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
The Commission‚Äôs task is not easy.
That is what Lisbon is about.
¬†¬† .
We still need new legislation.
What we need are reforms.
The answer is no.
How we implement them is important.
Finally: unfairly treated groups.
I ask them to support our Amendment 30.
Europe is not working well.
The first concerns methodology.
A new independence is what is needed.
¬†¬† .
I did not hear a response on that.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr¬†President.
¬†¬† We shall now proceed to the vote.
¬†¬† .
Please be quiet.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The rest is unchanged.
I ask for your support.
Are there any objections?
We would like to vote for that.
I hope I have clarified the situation.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .Mr Chairman,
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Nutrition and health claims
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is why I have voted against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
My criticism lies elsewhere.

Last Thursday, we ...
Yes, and you were against it!
We proposed that last Thursday.
Mr Juncker, we place our trust in you.
We see no sign of change.
She shows breathtaking courage.
I count myself a proponent of the EU.
Many thanks.
It must also act.

We must listen to the European people.
Here, 82% of the Dutch members voted .
What is happening?
The people know a few facts.
Nothing has happened.
¬†¬† That concludes this item.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

Energy brings synergy.
Four countries have signed the Treaty.
We will continue our work.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.

¬†¬† .
We really must set an example here.
Worldwide learning is crucial here.
This is an extremely important issue.
Quite the opposite.
I think a mandatory target is a must.
That is now the big challenge.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is the problem with this subject.
How can the Commission solve this?
This is an old idea.
In contrast, the EU lets things slide.
When the money is used, all is well.
Every word of the article was true.
That was not the point, however.
This brings us to quite a big problem.
¬†¬† .
Thank you for your comments.
This is a major question.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Why is this being done?
That is the goal.
I agree with Mrs Korhola.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It was neither effective nor economic.
Let us look at some of the figures.
¬†¬† .
This is not a sexy dossier.
Not sexy, but significant.
¬†¬† .
However, I was here for the speeches.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
So one can appreciate the difficulties.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
The other amendments I cannot accept.

There is a lot more besides.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The need, however, is a desperate one.
¬†¬† .
We are mad. We need both.
Then we will have a future.
¬†¬† .
Can we not do better?
I hope this will also be borne in mind.
I would offer her my congratulations.
¬†¬† .
I completely agree.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.

¬†¬† .


Here again terrorists win.
But what should we do together?
This is the biggest cost.
What should we not do together?
We cannot create a climate of panic.
We have to remember these people.
The danger lies in not reacting at all.
There are also other threats, however.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is no small thing.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

I would like to highlight two of them.
¬†¬† .
Allow me to specify what it entails.
¬†¬† .
Such a move is downright dangerous.
It is simply a matter of opening doors.
Privacy is another much-quoted example.
I have also been attacked in my home.
I sleep with an Uzi under my pillow.
What are these victories?
They feed it.
We have to see it as it is.
Is it fanaticism?
That is the easy answer.
But what feeds this fanaticism?
Were we always so honest in the past?
What is our stand today?
What are we going to collect?
We need to look at what is happening.
That is the solution.
That would make a real difference
The first is democratic control.
The Council should not ignore this.
The Chinese have other definitions.
That is one point.
I have five very brief points.
Such action weakens our democracy.
That is not what we need right now.
Either way it is a waste of money.
Have they had an effect?
What effect have they had?
Are any specific measures dispensable?
Europe needs to lead the way here.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
¬†¬† We shall now proceed to the vote.
We are opposed to that objective.
¬†¬† .
We voted against those proposals.
¬†¬† .
Consequently, our group voted against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The next item is the debate
We must go ahead, Mr Barroso, Minister.
I do not intend responding in detail.
That is where we are.
Let me be clear, once again.
We need it.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Barroso.
Thank you for your positive assessment.
Why these thanks?
For that I am grateful to him.
How can we achieve that?
I have time to make one simple point.
Indeed it does.
Two obstacles remain.
Surely that cannot be the case.
My group supports this report.
A lot can happen in eight years.
That is not how things are at present.
Is this a sensible development?
The obvious answer is no.
Some of us live in hope.
This is not going to happen.
¬†¬† Thank you Mr Wynn.
Those are the sort of networks we need.
They said ‚Äòyes‚Äô.
Only the funds remain to be cut.
That was the gist of my Amendment 357.
There are major tasks ahead of us.
I am opposed to renationalisation.
We are all equal.
I should like to make one final point.
It is there in this report.
Our proposal is a compromise.
That is not defensible.
This is nonsense.
How?
Europe has run aground.
¬†¬† .
And in order to do that, we need money.
I urge it not to do this.
Europe needs aid for research.
The Presidency proposes more.
Europe needs solidarity.
That is a message that we must convey.
I am constantly aware of it.
Pass your resolution!
That is my appeal.
That is my appeal to the Presidency.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This could be an important project.
I think this marks an important U-turn.
I should like to have this clarified.
Very few questions have been answered.
That concludes Question Time.
That definition is a very wide one.
This is a very important test.
¬†¬† .
Let us hope that this will be the case.
We should be fair to ourselves here.
Why is this so?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is not desirable.
I believe it is an excellent report.
Thank you.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
This is, of course, unacceptable.
That is unacceptable.
¬†¬† .

This is entirely hypocritical.


They feed tensions of all kinds.
Let us hope that it moves in time.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
No!
Why not also with excise?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We now need action, we need guidelines.
Now we need certainty.
The Watts case will be next.
That should be the rule.
Nevertheless, things change.
That is very important.
¬†¬† .
We expected nothing less from him.
We are adept at exporting our patients.
¬†¬† . Mr President, thank you.
I already knew that.
¬†¬† Mr President, thank you.
¬†¬† .
But we cannot do everything at once.
Some things are easier or more urgent.
That is the first priority.
Patient safety is important.
Patients‚Äô rights are important.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
Is hope changing sides?
I do not think so.
We shall do everything to achieve that.
However, this is a negotiation.

It has never existed.
D for democracy and dialogue.
Who could claim to be!
We must resist this temptation.
It is difficult, is it not?
However, there is a second pitfall.
No one has a quick-fix solution today.
We need to reflect.
We must be calm and collected.
This must all be reflected on.
We have to take this into account.
That is what we now expect from you.
They need to be ratified.
We need an answer to this too.
The negotiations will be open-ended.
We are a union of sovereign states.
It cannot work like that.
That is why the process goes on.
Why is there this gulf?
The public feel this gulf.
And there is a reason for this.
It does not work!
It is as simple as that!
Enlargement must remain a possibility.
It has to reform.
¬†¬† .
Europe is too secretive and too opaque.
If not you, then who?
The third truth: let us be clear!
Let us get to work!
It cannot continue to work that way.

So, what do we do?
No, this time it is a different matter.
So, how can we get out of this impasse?

What do the people want?
They want to remain free.
That is the formula for the future.
¬†¬† .
The future depends on informed consent.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Mr President, the die is cast.
Just one vote against sufficed.
We can dwell on that forever.
What is to be done?
You were living under dictatorships.
Europe is in crisis.
We must act now.
The matter is urgent.
Did the social issue not founder there?
This Constitution is now dead.
Do their votes count for nothing?
There are all the other countries too.
For what are we frightened of?
How is that now to be proceeded with?
Stop tormenting the Constitution.
History will catch up with you.
You lost.
The message, however, is not clear.
What is to be done?
I would beg to differ.
Start afresh.
Read our proposal.
This should not be forgotten.
If I may, I will add a footnote.
We cannot live with the Treaty of Nice.
We may need more time.
That is surely wrong!
We need an instrument.
I think not.
What have the voters said to us?
‚ÄòSorry, we do not really know Europe.
Something else has to happen.
We need a common agreement.
It does after all meet in public.
It involves national parliamentarians.
It would be the way forward.
There is no easy way forward.
They must say it, not us.
We must not give up so easily.
People react how and where they can.

Long may it last!
It is very much alive.
That is the task before us all.
I know of no magic formula.
Thank you again.
That too is a great political virtue.
We have an institutional problem.
We have to move forward.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The mask has slipped!
This will take time.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
Please wait a moment.

¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Bonde.
That is all on this amendment.
We were told that it was too soon.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Cavada.
It is 1.15 p.m.
So be it.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We have therefore voted to that effect.
¬†¬† .
In light of:
1.
2.
3.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Explanations of vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This proposal serves to plug a gap.
I believe we have a real opportunity.
¬†¬† .
Is this a reason to delay the reform?

This is a major task.
¬†¬† .
That is now a long time ago.
The story is old hat!
However, that is not the worst aspect.
That is absolutely meaningless.
These things will never happen!
The people do not want them.
¬†¬† .
They are at work in their offices.
Our work is badly organised.
This is a great innovation.
Do not aim for the wrong target.
That is a fact.
Why?
That is an absolutely vital reform.
We are unsympathetic to this proposal.
A greater consensus is needed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
But we can do more, and we want to.
¬†¬† .

How can it do this?
I should also like to raise two points.
It has a very different role today.
These have been mentioned.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
The full story is still very confused.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† Thank you for your answer.
What has happened is very serious.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Patience seems to be a virtue.
There is no logic to this whatsoever!
We need to look at this.
You mentioned taxation.
¬†¬† Question No 8 has been withdrawn.
¬†¬† That is very fair.
I find that very frustrating.
That concludes Question Time.
We accept the proposal as it stands.
I wish you luck with it.
Stability is necessary.
The opposite has happened, however.
I could quote many more examples.
My conclusion is clear.

The examples are there for all to see.
Enforcement of the rules is the key.
The problem is not with the euro.
We have not been able to maintain it.
What could Parliament do?
What could my group do?
Why?
Surely the answer would be ‚Äòno‚Äô.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
It was both necessary and essential.
We need to go further, however.
¬†¬† .
This has already been achieved.
¬†¬† .
Outsourcing has become a fact of life.
All of this needs to be addressed.
The challenges are huge.
That is where we must start.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
So much for extender oils.
Cancer has become the new Black Plague.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
At present the situation is untenable.
¬†¬† That concludes this item.
Thank you very much.
Are there any comments?
Both items will be debated jointly.
Hello.
Canada is also part of North America.
... it will be Europe‚Äôs failure‚Äô.
Let us get things in the right order.
That was the package that was rejected.
It was a mistake to reject it.
What a long way we have come!
We cannot compare apples and pears.
The two cannot be compared.
Today we have a disagreement.

Thank you Mr¬†Barroso.
So, there is room for improvement here.
I regretted it and it showed.
I have no time for acting.
That is why I am disappointed.
Not everyone can be De Gaulle.
I am surprised at my own modesty.
With enthusiasm!
I say it is, but let us be frank.
More work is needed.
Genuine reform comes at a price.
But let us be frank.
Cohesion was more or less kept.
This must involve Parliament.
This is wisdom itself.
We must look forward.
We must avoid that risk.
We are continuing to make decisions.
What follows now?
Is the glass half empty or half full?
What is our goal?
You were right there.
For that we are grateful to you.
The Council has not, and we will wait.
It is about everyone making a move.

¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
¬†¬† .
Forget about agreeing on the details!
Let us summarise.
What contempt for the law!
What a retreat from reality, too!
The Constitution is dead.
You are wasting time.
Let us, rather, start afresh.
Mr¬†Juncker is not one of them.
He is both an architect and a plumber.
Europe is in crisis.
I have just quoted Carlos¬†Fuentes.
I would like a response to that.
Nothing changes.
It is a little too late, however.
Who to choose?
Big?
Rich?
Active?
We have an enormous amount to do.
We must combat cross-border crime.


I would ask you to respond.
The situation mow seems quite wretched.
The Council also lacks vision.
I do not think so.
Wake up and smell the coffee!

We are ready for it.
More Europe also means more money.
And to develop it into what?
It was a huge disappointment.
How do we reduce unemployment?
How do we implement social cohesion?
What social model should we follow?
That is what this argument implies.
We must continue with this debate.
Thank you for all you have achieved.
We need to listen more and talk less.

We will have to return to this issue.

Secondly, we need a positive vision.
Roll on the British presidency!
Perhaps now things will change.

No deal is better than a bad deal.

Paths are made by walking.
Europe needs a clearly marked path.
Who wishes for that?
Who wants that?
We have no financial perspectives.
Much has been said about a fair return.
¬†¬† .
What will happen to the Constitution?
How will this affect enlargement?
Will we get our money?
What happens to all our projects?
¬†¬† Thank you, Mrs Wallstr√∂m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at noon tomorrow.
¬†¬† .
That is the legal basis.
What if these measures did not exist?
¬†¬† .
It is tragic.
The same is true for other items.
We will realise it.
¬†¬† .
That is what people cannot understand.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
It did not happen.
This planned A74 is a motorway to hell.
¬†¬† .
We have taken a step forward.
Wish lists are for the past.
But what do we achieve in doing this?
Why have we have achieved so much?
I have to thank my fellow rapporteurs.
Those people are so rarely thanked.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is the first step.
¬†¬† .
Congratulations, Michael!
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
It is, at the same time, operational.
Remember the aeroplane hijacks.
How does terrorism develop?
Who feeds it?
Perhaps they hit the big countries?
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Two issues concern me, however.

E-apathy is one of these obstacles.
This example is not unique.
We must now go one step further.
There is nothing new in this.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
Do European citizens have rights?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

Some have committed suicide.
The debate is closed.
What do we want?
Jacques Delors was one of them.
That storm abated.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
This is a timely address.
This is not just a misrepresentation.
Ideals survive through change.
I am a passionate pro-European.
I always have been.
It always will be.
There is no shame in that.
Failure on a grand, strategic scale.
And right now, they are not convinced.
It was supported by all leaders.
There are two possible explanations.
Traditional communities are broken up.
Ethnic patterns change.
It happens within a nation.
It is happening in Europe now.
Just reflect.
Did it?
We are half way through that period.
Has it succeeded?
Are we listening?
Such a position would be absurd.
And we have been told how to do it.
The Sapir report shows the way.
Let us put it into practice.
Third, implement the Lisbon Agenda.
Be under no illusion.
For a time it might, but not for long.
They are posing the questions.
It also raises high expectations.
But we cannot wait for 2013.
That is how it must be in the future!
You spoke about respect.
Let us go to work on Europe together.
You got up early this morning.
That is indeed the case.
Thank you for your attention.
¬†¬† . Thank you, Mr President.
So let me give you three suggestions.
First, Council transparency.
That is the nature of democracy.
Second, parliamentary scrutiny.
Third, public debate.
Last week called you .
Show it.
That is old Europe.
You withdraw your signature.
Welcome to the club, Mr¬†Blair.
You are right.
Welcome to the club, Mr¬†Blair.
That is what we are calling for.
Let us make that commitment together.
I call on you to take an initiative.
Very good.
I will remind you of four points.
Why are you ignoring them?
It is an issue for civilisation.
Where is the solidarity in that?
Let us get real about this.
Who are these people?
What are these plans?
There is nothing to reflect about.
We hope that he can deliver.
So it is with the European Union.
I wish you the best of luck.
It is up to you.
It is a quick win.
I want Europe to change.
Sticking-plaster politics do not work.
Ever-closer union has failed.
It is time to repatriate key powers.
The crisis was generated by the EU-15.
Let us adopt the Services Directive!
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
I thank you for that.
¬†¬† What a mess, Mr¬†Blair!
An ordered rectification is required.
The great crisis is war.
The great value is forgiveness.
It was the aftermath of the Cold War.
The great value was sharing.
They need our support.
Go to see Mr¬†Chirac.
Buy him dinner.
You will see, you will be reconciled.
And that must not happen.
It was a dream for 50 years.
How much is Europe worth?
But we place a higher value on Europe.
Let us not put it at risk.
That makes no sense mathematically.

I also share his views on the Budget.
That too needs to be changed.
So much for the Lisbon mission.
What we have here is a new situation.
That is what makes this situation new.
That brings us to today.
I ask you:
I would ask you to hurry up.
Alright.
Are you ready to listen to Mr Blair?
Then be quiet please.
¬†¬† .
It is good to see you here, Sir.
I agree with the agenda he has set out.
There is much in common we can work on.
Let us work on that together.
It is because of a sense of urgency.
It is serious and it is urgent!
That is not my determination at all.
That is something I understand.
I want to make one other final point.
This is a big moment of decision.
We must go ahead with our programme.
You can count on us.
We are going to our work every day.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.
¬†¬† .
Before the vote
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This was not the case.
¬†¬† .
There is the rub!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Reality is no mere passing detail.
Unfortunately, it was not to be.
I believe that this is possible.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our group‚Äôs vote against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is the reason for our request.
¬†¬† .
I do not know if that is possible.
Here we go again!
This is quite intolerable.
I am very much against this proposal.
Let us keep Question Time.
¬†¬† .
We are not begging.
The memory calls for justice.
Suicide rates increase with age.
Live 8 was a tremendous success.
In particular I refer to Zimbabwe.
What an indictment of his own people.
We must act.
A number of passes were issued to us.
Thank you.
¬†¬† That concludes this item.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
That has not happened.
We owe this to the euro.
Consumers benefit from the strong euro.
To what is this attributable?
Credibility is in short supply.
Consumers were not born yesterday.
It is a problem that we can solve.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What has come out of this Pact?
So how do we measure success?
This is the logical second step.
Short-term campaigns are not effective.
The workers have run out of patience.
For that we are grateful.
This is what citizens expect from us.
So rejoice!
I am a fervent supporter of Europe.
This is not how things should be done.
¬†¬† .
That debate is now over.
¬†¬† .
Mr¬†President,
President of the European Central Bank.
It is good for jobs and growth.
I will mention two things.
We debate issues among ourselves.
Thank you, Mr Trichet.


Let me explain what I mean.
It deserves to be thanked.
It is a genuinely positive result.
¬†¬† .
The danger is strictly the same.
He stood his ground.
Phthalates are dangerous chemicals.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
Many Member States have good systems.
¬†¬† .
What more, then, do we want?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Action is really desperately needed.
Air quality must improve.
The world needs clean technology.
Is that the Europe that you want?
This is something we cannot accept.
Air pollution causes illness and kills.
¬†¬† .
I very rarely get furious.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
I commend this proposal to the House.
¬†¬† .
Certainly in itself it does not.
This directive is an opportunity.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
What do the largest companies do today?
How can we face up to this challenge?
The best way is freedom.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What is the biggest problem?

¬†¬† .
Today that is patently obvious!
¬†¬† .
Patents are not a sword.
Why abolish copyright?
There have been many lies here.
Much has been said about innovation.
Why do we need this legislation?

In fact, add India to that list.
I would like to have a clear answer.
We should seize this opportunity.
The important thing is Lisbon.
We need this directive.
Some of them were a little aggressive.
Your lobbying was miserably bad.
You should take it seriously.
It contains far too many ambiguities.
So why do we need a common approach?
That should be stressed.
Copyright is there to protect software.
The Council is itself unsure.
What was the Council‚Äôs response?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Software patents are not the way to go.
¬†¬† We now come to the votes.
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
A warm welcome to you!
¬†¬† .
We even note a paradox.
Expel him from the Chamber immediately!
I said expel him from the Chamber!
If there are any, remove them.
¬†¬† .
The enlarged Union will proceed as one.
Yes, the young Europe.
You have said it very clearly.
Allow me to thank you once again.
I shall be very brief.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted for this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Children‚Äôs health must come first.
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
All these objectives merit support.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
A Potemkin policy!
Or was it an optical illusion?
Nonsense!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The initial effort needs to be kept up.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour of the Myller report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Child labour is a complex issue.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I am grateful to all concerned.
I thank everybody for their help.
I am not ignoring Mr Casa‚Äôs report.
I will list some of them.
Perhaps I can give one or two examples.
The Commission accepts this.
We have to find an appropriate balance.
It is merely a clarification.
We do not underestimate these problems.
The Commission supports you in this.
Solidarity must not mean weakness.
These policies must be optimised.
Outside, there is the , but this is a .
We are not requesting more money.
Those are areas under threat.
These are not just words.
There is no good argument for this.
Why do I¬†mention this?
Why should not we opt for them?
The mere thought of this is horrifying.
These are ridiculous arrangements.
People live here, not robocops!
The outstanding issues are now clear.
I shall note three of them.
We are now planning to change that.
Why?
Let the rule stay as it is!
This will in turn enhance job creation.
Europe must display solidarity.
Why?
The large city issue is universal.
So, what is it we are saying?

It was a very short visit.
Aquaculture is made more visible.
I am willing to look into this further.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Let us be frank.
That, I think, is what we should do.
¬†¬† .
What are the real circumstances?
The murderers are free.
That is the reality.
That is the situation.
We cannot write reports from Brussels.
Prejudice is rampant against women.
I offer my congratulations.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
It has an economic value.
¬†¬† .
This House is contributing its own.
That is why I welcome this proposal.
What about your actual timetable?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Let me touch on some of those debates.
The record to date is patchy.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
The process is a difficult one.
Where did Mexico get the data?
I ask for your forbearance.
These are not my questions.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
We have two objectives.
This is not the case.
That really would be the end.
We must support them from outside.
Let us change the rules.
Let us see what we can do.
¬†¬† .
Why?
I am always flexible and open.
The Council came after us.
This is the real crux of the problem.
Of course we are.
We should also work via Ukraine.
In the Commission, it is more complex.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The first concerns cumulation.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We clearly share the same objectives.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
That strategy is bearing fruit.
There is no disguising that.
Leave aside the arguments of the past.
The security situation is poor.
I look forward to today's debate
¬†¬† .
I shall not give any figures.
I am turning the page.
That is our bottom line.
Why?
It is ethically irresponsible.
You owe us some explanations!
How?
This is truly the last turning point.
That is the truth.
The occupying forces must leave.
They need to understand that.
That is the real truth.
We have lived through it.
The occupying army must leave.
That is the right thing to do.
Let us speak the truth.
We should not be ashamed.
Long live democracy.
Long live freedom.
Long live self-determination.
The cost of failure would be high.
That is a brave new call.
¬†¬† .
That is the only solution.
That must be an inclusive approach.
We know how difficult it is.
With respect, that is wrong.
There have been very few incidents.
Why?
I am not naive.
I thank you very much for that.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at noon today.
Mandela was right.
Millions have had to flee their homes.
However, we have to do more.
Why?
Let us hope that it will.
Africa has changed.
Finally, the world has changed.
In any case, I see no better one.
On what should this marriage be based?
The first axis is governance.
Africa, however, is starting to move.
The third axis is, obviously, trade.
Clearly we have to reverse this trend.
Finally, the last axis is culture.
It is, however, vital.
I have heard talk of sanctions.
It would be useful to open this debate.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Now that pledge has slipped to 2030.
I wish you success.
We are still a long way from that.
Our action must be clear.
So, what are we to do?
There are now no ifs or buts or whens.
We can all ...



They were not among the hooligans!
I would like to make three points.
Firstly, on making poverty history.
What should we do in the short term?
Three things.
‚ÄòMake poverty history in 2005.
He is quite right.
There is a strong connection.

That is why we need more of it.
That is the first point.
It is how we did it here in Europe.
You may speak for as long as you wish.
If not now, then when?‚Äô
Now is the time to act.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Benn.
I do not think it right or proper.
¬†¬† Mr President, I am privileged.
¬†¬† You are extremely unruly today.
Not at all.
We know that.
It is an important cultural factor.
We are the ones who must do so.
We have no more excuses.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place next.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I hope the House will consent to that.
That is one suggestion.
This is an addition: a further recital.
There had to be one winner.
That brings the voting to a close.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì Europe needs clear rules.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is also my opinion.
This can be no mere coincidence.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We shall vote in favour of this report.
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour of this report.
The EU must also change.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


Hence our vote against.
Words are not enough; we need action.
This will require enormous resources.
Many of them were killed.
¬†¬† Thank you, Minister.
For years, we left the Bosniaks alone.
That was also the reality of the time.
All the recordings have been found.
Let us never forget that lesson.
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
He has not yet been rehabilitated.
We lived those images.
I refer to Srebrenica.
It must not repeat them.
¬†¬† .
Mr Posselt raised the issue of Croatia.
I pay tribute to his work today.
None of this will be easy.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
But much more is needed.
Now Taiwan is a full democracy.
It is one of our key objectives.
Nevertheless, concerns remain.
¬†¬† .
There is a political dialogue.
I will stop here.
¬†¬† .
I would like to make three main points.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Is that really so?
Is not this hypocrisy?
None whatsoever.
¬†¬† .
No date was set for a decision.
Let me say a word or two in conclusion.
This is all to the good.
¬†¬† .
They have concentrated on a few topics.
That is simply not true.
I would also like to mention Taiwan.
The debate is closed.
The Convention is a success story.
There is still much to be done.
It is very nice to see him here.
More than 60 civilians died.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Does the Council agree?
I hope he is enjoying the experience.

¬†¬† .
We have taken a lead on this.
The tickets only cost EUR¬†149.
¬†¬† .
Very good.
Has it already been?
These are specific questions.
That seems to me to be common sense.

¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
That ends Question Time.
We feel very strongly about that.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.

Who knows anything about the EIB?
That is all we are talking about.
I think it is high time we did this.
2005 is the year of micro-credit.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
This is in order to keep him alive.
But we need to move fast.
But it is not yet being implemented.
This practice must be stopped.
Urgent action must be taken.
That is pretty minimal.
Can you still stand by that statement?
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
It is even clearer now.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We need to make considerable progress.
These are the three main segments.
Why do we need to hurry?
First of all, free competition.
We think it is balanced and open.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Why are we having this debate?
The political decision has been taken.
¬†¬† .
Eighteen months is indeed a long time.
These are the really crucial issues.
Their accession is guaranteed.
The question, perhaps, is when exactly?
I strongly reassured them.
That is the precedent we should follow.
How should we honour their memory?
We have given our word.
Consolidation will mean more Europe.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .

The damage, we know, is global.
How has it been enriched?
Why?
Yet we also require specific tools.
That is something we cannot accept.
That cannot be true.
What will we do in those cases?
We need you.
That really would be regrettable.
It is worth it.
This is a growing sector.
The money must be secure.
Is this an appropriate ratio?

Many thanks.
¬†¬† .
LIFE + sets out to make a difference.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
There is good and bad in this.
Are there perhaps other variations?
Will they get their goods?
¬†¬† .
I congratulate the rapporteur.
¬†¬† .
The idea is absurd.
¬†¬† .

Little wonder that we cannot compete.
That loophole must be closed.
That sums up its capacity.
We all stand with you today.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is voting time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì That concludes voting time.
I strongly support the motion.
I genuinely regret that.
I do not believe that it is.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted for this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is a demographic power.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

We are only seeing the first stage.
What can we do?



It is also acting positively.
The matter was discussed.
It is not true that it would do so.
That is something worth repeating.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in September.
The third aspect is that of exports.

The proposal constitutes a package.
This needs to be pointed out.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
I therefore support the report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I will now turn to Zimbabwe.
How does such arrogance come about?
We agree about that.
They definitely must be applied.
Obviously, I agree.
Someone tell me what has to be done.
Do troops need to be sent in?
What should be done?
I am not indifferent to such a debate.
We are not just a sounding board.
That is what I hear, and I believe it.
That is what I believe.
That is something you should know.
That goes without saying.
This is disgraceful.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
‚ÄòNo protection, no justice‚Äô.
Many had been raped.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .

We must step up our efforts, however.


Today is for decency and humanity.
I intervened personally.
Mr Solana intervened.
We shall see what comes of the matter.
Naturally, it is risky.
Of course, it is dangerous.
Who would imagine otherwise?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
¬†¬† We shall now proceed to the vote.
¬†¬† The vote is closed.
¬†¬† .
Mrs Frassoni would like to do so.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Poettering.
In fact, the situation has worsened.
It is incomprehensible.
¬†¬† Mr President,
Thus far, they have refused.
¬†¬† That concludes this item.
¬†¬† .
Let me give you some examples.
Climate change is happening now.
This is my message.
We will support it in this area.
It is horrendous.
We too are with them.
Disasters know no borders.
Many people have been arrested.
That has worked very well up until now.
That also applies to inert waste.
This is intended to achieve that end.
Well, let us see how the votes go.
¬†¬† .
It brings in bauxite to make alumina.
We need very strong ‚Ä¶
That is why I welcome this report.
I have personal experience of this.
¬†¬† .
Procedures alone are not enough.
Are sects accepted from now on?
What subjects are debated?
That beats the wedding feast at Cana.
Yet who are they trying to kid?
One hundred years ago!
That is an initial practical remark.
¬†¬† .
I support what has just been said.
Community measures are vital.
That is unacceptable.
Right now, what can we do?
It was a sickening sight.
What controls you carry out?
Do you not know all that?
Who will fly there in winter?
What planes will fly there?
We want answers here.
We want safe flights at long last.
You said that you sent experts.
Did you send a flight safety expert?
You said they went to Cyprus.
So who are the specialists?
Let us tell the truth in here.
That is a crime against the people.
The rapporteur has explained it.
I already have one for it.
The agency is only three years old.
This is unacceptable.
I would insist on four requirements.


Why have we taken so long?
1.
2.
3.
4.

I wish the project every success.
I hope we will make it this time.
I will look more respectable tomorrow.
That is something we cannot change.
The Galileo project is one such area.
For once, the EU is on the right track.
It is now too late in the day for this.
Europe can no longer be the first one.
I give my approval.
It is vital for:
That goes against the grain with me.
This is absolute nonsense.
That is not specific to the UK.
They are adults.
And how would you prove liability?
Which way do we want Europe to go?
Let me give you another brief example.
I was not in office at the time‚Äô.
There must be common European rules.
None of us disagree with that.
It is impossible to operate.
We want legal certainty.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

I will be voting for this.
However, it goes deeper.
I should like to answer two questions.
We have also changed the percentages.
Let that be remembered today.
¬†¬† Mr President, esteemed colleagues.
Thank you.
Thank you.

PROGRESS depends on them.
Etymologists set us thinking.

¬†¬† .
Mr President, that is my conclusion.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
Today, there are 50 times that many.
Revising the directive is not easy.
We must remedy this shortcoming.
Yet is it reality TV, for example?
How can we help them to do this?
For me, that is a crucial point.
However, we also have some experience.
Television is without frontiers.
In the UK is called 'It's a Knock-Out'.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at noon.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is voting time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the vote

- Henri Weber report (A6-0202/2005)
¬†¬† .
How is it possible to do all this?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
However, there is also another problem.
¬†¬† .
We cannot foresee the future.
That is unacceptable.
‚ÄòMake poverty history‚Äô.
We cannot do a thing.
Europe is getting poor.
There is no development.
We cannot get Europe out of poverty.
It is ruining us.
Europe is getting poor.
This is the wrong policy.
Think about the people.
We cannot accept it.
The cuts are unsurprising, as usual.
Why not wait for that?
But why?
No chance!
In my opinion, it makes little sense.

It is a tragedy and a scandal.
I find this highly regrettable.
But what a mockery!
Yes, the European Union really is sick.
Reconstruction is a huge project.
Our arguments have not succeeded.
On the contrary.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the joint debate.
It was a comprehensive reply.
¬†¬† .
It was a truly surprising interview.
¬†¬† . I thank you for your kind words.
¬†¬† . I can only say that I agree.
I could not agree more.
I thank you for your support.
Above all else, who is paying for it?
¬†¬† .
My answer is no.
We must remember what has happened.
Is it the American authorities?
The airline companies?
European authorities?
That was months ago.
What is the position on this issue?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† . We will work in this direction.
That concludes Question Time.
Our work is essential.
I know Parliament is capable of that.
Those, in essence, are our proposals.
It is the least we can do for them.
¬†¬† .
Parents should also be involved.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
There are a number of answers to that.
We will support it in our policies.
That is what is essential here.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† . Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Why do we need harmonised VAT rates?
To help the single market?
It is, however, a reality.
Why should Europe not do the same?
Why?
Let us make no mistake.
What is Europe good for?
Your vote will be decisive.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is who we are talking about today.
We want to catch up with that.
We welcome the MICE.
They could not understand it.
It is their money we are carving up.
Our ultimate aim is a¬†healthy child.
Nevertheless, we must be demanding.
What are we doing to children?
We should not consent to this.
Why is that?
Three problem areas can be identified.
That is not a good thing.
I would support the first option.
There is no way of getting around this.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.

Time is pressing upon us.
There is no other way.
¬†¬† .
They have the right to a fair trial.

I will return to that in a moment.
I want to say a few words about that.
The end does not justify the means.
It will not.
Of course we must have cooperation.
We will support you.
Indeed, allow me a slight digression.
This really has to stop.

We simply do not understand it.
They only see national police forces.
That goes without saying.
We must not choose the wrong target.
You may well ask why.
I would be obliged if you could do so.
No-fly lists are another concern.
Who has access to these lists?
Not all suspects are identified.
The costs are .
They are not worth the money.
The terrorist threat affects us all.
I am a European Muslim.
Let us lay our cards on the table here.
Balance is essential.
They are indeed, but why?
Why are we not doing that?
I agree entirely.
That is what should happen!
I will just add one other point.
I cannot ‚Äì they are here.
How should we act now?
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
It has now gone 12.30 p.m.
The Presidency must do something.
¬†¬† That point is noted.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
( : see Minutes)
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That treaty has been rejected.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is not very convincing.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I warmly welcome this proposal.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That goes without saying.
¬†¬† .
All extremist groups are prohibited.
But real challenges lie ahead.
The Commission is helping in this.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is also a global problem.
¬†¬† .
That is a recipe for disaster.
Yet the glass is sadly also half-empty.
How should this be approached?
The settlers have left Gaza.
Gaza has a border with Egypt at Rafa.
Iran began talks with the WTO.
Those are the only tools we have.
Then they protested.
Finally, I will turn to Iran.
Iran must stay out of Iraqi affairs.
The people there are wretched.
Of course, that is true.
This is an achievement.

¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This needs to be addressed.
Thank you.
That is how it should continue to be.
I believe it has much to commend it.
All of these have been emphasised here.
I take my hat off to you, Mr Queir√≥.
I am referring to the IMSERSO holidays.
It is as simple as that.

Secondly, it is also an area of growth.
All of that is good.
It is an excellent report.
People now travel at lightning speed.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
¬†¬† Dear Colleagues,
Poverty influences health.
In lean times, that is no bad thing!
Mr Martin had a supplementary question.
¬†¬† .
Which is it?
Tell us the truth!
¬†¬† ‚Äì I agree with Mr¬†Newton¬†Dunn.
It goes on to elaborate on that point.
¬†¬† That was not a bad answer!
Let me elaborate on that answer.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That is undoubtedly true.
¬†¬† Question No 4 is withdrawn
Let us take the example of Croatia.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† That concludes Question Time.
¬†¬† .

That is our political task.
¬†¬† .
This can reduce mortality by 35%.
This is entirely unnecessary ideology.
We do not need obscurantist attitudes!
It is a real gender issue.
That cannot be right.
We women are not a minority, however.
I hope we will meet again in daylight.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
It is quite an undertaking these days.
This emerges clearly from the report.
Here, too, we are of the same opinion.
¬†¬† .
I have no quibbles there.
There is a significant omission here.
Here is another example.
I hope she can clarify that statistic.
Why?
Is it really necessary?
I should like to thank the rapporteur.
No, they are not.
Are they meeting quality targets?
The answer is ‚Äòno‚Äô.
Again, the answer is ‚Äòno‚Äô.
The classes are too large.
Letters are going unanswered.
¬†¬† .
A very interesting picture emerged.
What about multilingualism?
That is the main issue.
They found clear discrimination.
The debate is closed.
The ninth is the Russian Federation.
¬†¬† .
It is our sea: .
¬†¬† .
It wants European Union involvement.
We should respond to that.
Why?
All this should be taken into account.
It has two options.
I firmly believe that it needs it.
So give it its own budget line.
So let us get more focus.
They need to work together.
That option obviously has its merits.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
I shall return to this point.
Let us not deceive ourselves.
I shall give just two examples.
Let us not delude ourselves.
¬†¬† .
I entirely agree with this idea.
In other words, .

Nor can we agree with paragraph 10.
Do we need a new DG to do that?
I am not so sure.
That I regard as improper.
That is a completely absurd proposal.
Again, this is not a task for the EU.
We can be positive in this field.
I wish to raise three points.
I spoke for two minutes.
Tourism must plan well.
It must build on opportunities.
¬†¬† .
It is not our job to decide for them.
That is a promise.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
That is my theme.
In my case, I live with diabetes.
Clinical research is slow and patchy.
The story goes on.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I wish to make three very brief points.
We really need to do some work.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is voting time.
¬†¬† .
Mr President, I have an oral amendment.
‚Äì That concludes voting time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Let us not disappoint them!
¬†¬† .







¬†¬† We are voting against this report.
We are opposed to all such proposals.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Do as I say and not as I do!
¬†¬† .
Unlike some Members I welcome this.
¬†¬† .
Such shortcomings must be remedied.
¬†¬† .
There are many other solutions.
¬†¬† .
Thank you for your attention.

Why?




We have not.
Not to any adequate extent.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Must we do the same?
Aid is finally there.
For Africa?
¬†¬† .
A food crisis is complex.
¬†¬† .
That is the chronology of events.
What is the situation today?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
What are normal religious activities?
Let us call a spade a spade.
That is immaterial.
Everyone is persecuted.
Things are getting worse, not better.
There has been much talk of dialogue.
This is not just about economics.
China deserves outright condemnation.
These statistics are truly alarming.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
These letters have remained unanswered.
We do not wish to isolate Syria.
¬†¬† .
How will the Commission do this?
¬†¬† .
They refused to sign it.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.
No amendments have been proposed.
Mr Watson confirms that.
No amendments have been proposed.
I am pleased about that too.
Perhaps the most important issue.
That possibility exists.
There is no legal vacuum.
Those problems are still there.
We have enough time.
We did so.
¬†¬† .
I can assure you of that.
¬†¬† .

That is unacceptable!

¬†¬† .
Is Germany ready to reform?
Will Italy deal with its deficit?
But permit me a word on process.
Our approval is your legitimacy.
We need more champions like Airbus.
Arguably the recipe is not quite right.
For the present, it is in cold storage.
¬†¬† .
Your situation is, in fact, peculiar.
What happened?
That is the least a Parliament can do.
Full stop.
Is that better regulation?
We know what its content is.
We want a Parliament.
¬†¬† .
I believe you are right.
I would put forward three proposals.
One single example: war and peace.
¬†¬† .
What are we doing here today?
Your people deserve better than that.
¬†¬† .
For once, law comes close to morality.
We will oppose them both.
¬†¬† .
Mrs Ber√®s has requested the floor.
The debate is closed.
Is that alright with Europe?
Does it tally with rural development?
¬†¬† ‚Äì Mr President, a man died.
Simon Wiesenthal died.
A 96-year-old man passed away.

I urge you to help in this case.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
There is no Europe without solidarity.
¬†¬† .
Their message is one of European unity.
Thank you, Europe!
Brotherhood underpins European unity.
This vision remains relevant today.
It was a movement inspired by values.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
I experienced this myself.
It breaks up families and societies.
Our freedom is not all it could be.
We are all indebted to Solidarity.
Unemployment exceeds 15%.
The standard of living is plummeting.
The leaders deceived the workers.
It is not easy to show solidarity.
And so it came to pass.
Poland is a symbol for Europe.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† , .
This is an important step forward.
¬†¬† .
Basel is an international agreement.
We must, though, weigh up their merits.
It is down to the Council.
¬†¬† .
I will enlarge on this point later on.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Our constituents expect that.
I will make three remarks.
We are not designed for that purpose.
I would now like to turn to the report.
We do not care how this is done.
I will conclude by making two remarks.
That is why this is an important task.
¬†¬† .
It is also important for depositors.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
We must have proper auditors in the EU.
Economic confidence will grow.
So we strongly support the outcome.
The Commission can agree with this.
¬†¬† .
That is what matters most of all.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Let me now turn to the amendments.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I have a few questions.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What do we want?
We must protect the refugees.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is all very generous.
Which are these safe countries?
¬†¬† .
I fear that Lampedusa is no exception.
Alas, poor us!
¬†¬† I am sorry to hear this.
That is inherently contradictory.
To what kind of pass has Europe come?
Why, though, should it be?
That is the state we are in.
I understand this need well.
We should not automatically presume.
It is a matter of credibility.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
This is only a first phase agreement.
This is not at all the case.
This is not mutual recognition.
¬†¬† .
We have no need of synthetic wine!
The USA has left the OIV.
¬†¬† .


We can take pride in our European wine.
¬†¬† .
Only the Members may do that.

Long live European wine!
All the best, Commissioner!
What will happen to them?
¬†¬† .
That is an important point.
However, various myths seem to abound.
That goes without saying.
He can be quite sure about that.
The debate is therefore closed.
It has been said that he did not do so.
¬†¬† .
I ask you to endorse it.
¬†¬† Thank you for that clarification.
Here is the said bottle of champagne.
¬†¬† .
The June List does not share that view.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† , .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Is Afghanistan safe after the war?
¬†¬† ‚Äì The sitting is resumed.
Are there any comments?
What is the future for Europe?
For our Europe.
¬†¬† .
We also have variety in Europe.
Take the transport area, for example.
What is territorial cohesion?
How typical of this mad European Union.
The urban aspect is worthy of mention.
The new countries lag far behind.
It aims for territorial integration.

But we shall leave that to one side.
The regions are artificial.
They are spurious.
They have no identity.
We English are very tolerant.
We do it with resignation.
So carry on with your policy.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Kilroy-Silk.
We need to give them solace. .
The region is the foundation of Europe.
Nonetheless, it remains a dream.
I come from the Mazowsze region.
My fourth remark concerns the agencies.
All in all, I support them.
What can the EU do about this?
That was done in Luxembourg in May.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
I now give the floor to Mr Stubb.
It is a very good initiative.
If that is the case, I am all for it.
We need more freedom.
I have two suggestions to make.
¬†¬† .
The Commission has agreed to this.
We will therefore be very vigilant.
What place is given to standardisation?
¬†¬† .
The same applies to legislation.
¬†¬† It is an interesting case.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you for your suggestion.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Forget competition.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
At this stage, that is all I can offer.
That is all I can say at the moment.
The question is straightforward.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What is the reason?
Have you any information on the matter?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Have you received them?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you for that information.
Do you agree with that prediction?
That is absolutely clear.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is a fact-finding exercise.
¬†¬† .
Thank you for your cooperation.
¬†¬† .
That would be one way of proceeding.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This does nothing to redress the issue.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
In my opinion, this is accurate.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is the reason.
¬†¬† .
That would cause huge problems.
¬†¬† .
Two ideas were put forward.
¬†¬† Yes, we did.
I had hoped that you had heard me.
That concludes Question Time.




That is the way forward.





We must grant them equal opportunities!
This is the crux of the matter.
That is what counts.
I share many of your concerns.
Turkey‚Äôs reform process is ongoing.
The reforms count.
That is the best guarantee of success.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is something that worries me.
We know that torture is still going on.
¬†¬† .
Let me tell you what our group wants.

¬†¬† Wait a moment please, Mr Schulz.
Please calm down and be quiet.
That is a day to which I look forward.

¬†¬† .
This is about enlargement.
Just shut up, will you?
In that case, I mean Mr de Villiers.
You are not the centre of the universe!
That is a legitimate debate.
They are already included among us.
Is Islam European?
¬†¬† .
I stand by that.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
But, as usual, Brussels will plough on.
Good!
Much has been written on this subject.
They know very well what goes on.
They perceive things differently.
That is courageous.
Let there be no doubt about this.


That by way of a brief comment.
And yet that is the case with Cyprus.
Why is this so?
To say otherwise would be to lie.
To say otherwise would again be to lie.
Turkey bans him. That is racism.
This ban is racism.
It is an insult.
You are ruining the European project!
What has happened?
Orhan Pamuk is being put on trial.
Torture is still widely practised.
That is a question that remains open.
We believe our culture is unique.
We are building the EU upon it.
They tried that for a thousand years.
Turkey really is changing day by day.
That is completely unacceptable.
They must have access now.
Let us be consistent.
Those conditions have been met.
The rejectionists are in the south.
That is not justice.
The Cyprus issue must be resolved.
We kept none of our promises.
The people have requested some respite.
Who are we trying to kid?
What hypocrisy!
And Europe for that matter?
It still has no budget for the future.
But fine is only what is true.
That is what we intend to do.
¬†¬† .
That should be our objective.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† I am delighted.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† We shall continue with the votes.
¬†¬† .
I shall read it out:
It begins like this:
¬†¬† .
The Commission has the floor.
¬†¬† .
I suspect that it should be 2013.
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
I should like to know the truth.
¬†¬† .
That says it all, really.
¬†¬† .

What a revelation!
¬†¬† .
It was a ‚Äòno‚Äô from all sides.
¬†¬† .
This is also being proven now.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
They related to:
4/ the denial of the Kurdish issue.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
This is hardly healthy for the economy.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I live in the south west of Ireland.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
The IEA proceeds by unanimity.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is not you alone who have to do so.
This shows a lack of perspicacity.
The answer, unfortunately, is 'no'.
Bioethanol is one of these sources.
1.
We ought to stabilise oil prices.
Is progress being made?
Energy conservation must come first.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is the right way to proceed.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
That means winning their support.
¬†¬† , .
What were the achievements?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The glass is half full.
This is disappointing.
The summit was a failure.
Let us be clear, however.
Of these tasks, none has been achieved.
That is further in the future, however.
That must change.
We also have a right to protect.
Thank you.
We need a parliamentary component.
That is how things stand.
Nothing has changed.
What does all that mean?
That is our problem.
What was planned was not achieved.
Reform is nothing to be ashamed of.
There is no disgrace in reform.

Why is this so important?
How do we now follow this up in the EU?
We must do better.
¬†¬† .
It is vital that guarantee is in place.
The next point raised was by Mr Portas.
I have spoken about that already.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Let me do my best.
¬†¬† 'Yes, Minister!'
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
So, let me repeat it for the record.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Does the Council share this appraisal?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is a challenge to the Council.
You can do better.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I look forward to that reply.
I hope the Minister catches his plane.
That concludes Question Time.
¬†¬† .

It shows that history has an impact.
This also applies to Belarus.






It did not apply unilateral measures.
¬†¬† .
My final question is this.
¬†¬† .
Where do we go from here?
I hope you can convince me otherwise.
Europe is not adapting quickly enough.
Consumers want cheap T-shirts.
The traders are the same.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I have explained this to Mr¬†Mandelson.
I have sent a note to Mr¬†Mandelson.
Nobody is expecting change overnight.
Let us cast our minds back:
We are not at the beginning.
So is our customs union partner Turkey.
It waited too long.
Consumer prices are also involved.
Can you confirm these figures?
What did we do?
It is a difficult tightrope.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
I urge Members to support this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
China joined the WTO in 2001.
¬†¬† .
If we do not, others will.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
She will have mine.
What has changed?
It also has high-tech production.
That is something different.
That cannot be the way either.


That is what I can tell you.

I have no other option.
We all ought to give this our backing.
That is what caused this problem.

¬†¬† We shall now move on to the votes.
The following is appended to Part 20:
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
‚Äì (B6-0461/2005): Oil
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .I voted in favour of this text.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour of this resolution.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Bioenergy is unnecessary.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is a shocking figure.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
However, we have several reservations.
That is easy to demonstrate.
We do need safeguards, though.
It would have been polite.
China has its own way of doing things.
I do not think that will work.
This, I believe, is a promising option.
And the changes are accelerating.
That makes me optimistic.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
It must be sustained and reciprocated.
However, it has so much to offer.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We in the EU must also play our part.
It is long overdue.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
This has not happened.
This has not happened.
This has not happened either.
The grace period is almost up.
Mrs Pack has also referred to this.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Or could we be deceiving ourselves?
Oppression breeds oppression.
This is the only strategic solution.
All these things are unacceptable.
This is our duty.
¬†¬† .
The authorities still have much to do.
Let me mention just a few examples.
Thank you for your attention.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
That is not on!
I oppose the motion.
We should simply call it by its name.
(1)
¬†¬† .
This work needs to continue.
Here we are making concrete progress.
¬†¬† .
Mr President, today is a special day.
¬†¬† .
We already have the answer.
Fortress Europe does not exist.
It is a fantasy.
¬†¬† .
Our futures are interdependent.
Why?
We need a consensus on economic policy.
¬†¬† .
Is that acceptable?
¬†¬† .

What is the immediate cause?
What is the solution?


That is the solution we must support.
What, then, can be done?
We will visit Malta in January.
We await some answers.


¬†¬† .
The Council does not share his view.
Migration has many causes.
Now Europe is an attractive place.

Many sleepless nights.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Let me therefore start with the latter.
¬†¬† .
Each is a matter of deep concern.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Of course they are!
What does that mean?
We are cornering the cat.
What the Americans want is irrational.
I now turn to the resolution.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Thank you.
That is a step in the right direction.
Do you understand?
The truth is killing us.

¬†¬† Thank you for that.
That concludes the one-minute speeches.

First principle: equality.
Second principle: partnership.
Third principle: appropriation.
¬†¬† .
That is not an ideal situation.
The primary responsibility is theirs.
Ownership is desirable in both cases.
My time is up.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Infrastructure is one of these factors.
It is not enough to mobilise funds.
Africa must help itself.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is what we should do.
They are based in Europe.
Africa does not need more weapons.
I wish to raise five points.
That is your challenge.
Population growth is another issue.
Yet, the results were insignificant.
¬†¬† .
I am like you.
We need to know what is desired.
I wanted to make that point clear.
My final remark concerns trade.
Is it enough?
We need to be aware of that.
The debate is closed.
Sounds familiar?
¬†¬† .
How wrong we were!
¬†¬† .
I still am.
¬†¬† .
I saw how beautiful democracy can be!

That, though, is not what they are for.
¬†¬† .
That is what I truly believe.
We have put pressure on him.
That is what I believe.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
A cornerstone is the one at the corner.
My government is not here.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Why is this?
That is your strategy.
I should like to thank the rapporteur.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
This is the way it should be.
This is the least we can do!
Migrants stay in the host countries.
¬†¬† .
The EU can make this possible.
Multilingualism creates new prospects.
I shall try to speak in French.
Well, in England we certainly do not.
That is Racine.
I could say that aged 18.
Could I buy a ticket on the metro?
No!
So how do we integrate immigrants?
I have no time to explain further.
The PPE-DE Group supports this report.
Let me mention just two of them.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Mrs Pack has put them on the map.
Not much has changed on that front.
I share their concern.
It is a good approach.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
But that is not enough.
What are we talking about?
Let me cite just one example.
¬†¬† .

What will the future be like?
The media, as an example ...
Yet it is for sale here.
No it is not!
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Deep poverty does exist in Europe.
¬†¬† I declare the sitting closed.
The IND/DEM Group was simply skipped.
I have observed this before.
On our chaotic health system?
On our crumbling school buildings?
On our housing crisis?
Not our Charlie!
What is the question before us today?
Is that not a huge waste?
We already have objectives.
What are those resources?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We pay the bills.
It is here that most migrants arrive.
Our towns and cities are not isolated.
78% of us live in cities.
I unreservedly endorse this report.
¬†¬† .
We have listened very carefully.
I now turn to the report.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
¬†¬† .
Completion is set for 2008.
Here ends the tale of my report.
¬†¬† .
I now await your next initiative.
Thank you.
¬†¬† .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
It did not happen.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is the vote.
I would be obliged to you if you could.
Thank you.
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
I therefore voted in favour.
The extra information is crucial.
This is unacceptable.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This ought to be our challenge.
The first relates to internal matters.
This is very regrettable.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our abstention.
¬†¬† .
It is the world on its head.
I did so for the following reasons:
¬†¬† .
Unfortunately, this is not happening.
¬†¬† .
Why women?
Debate without resolution!
(1)
This is not something we want to see.
I would ask that we all do that.
Estonia is a full Member of the EU.
The reason for this is obvious.
Common sense may eventually prevail.
¬†¬† Mr President, poverty is silent.
The sights are crying out, as well.
Obviously he is right.
This has never happened before.
Unfortunately, this is not the case.
I hope we will.
¬†¬† That concludes Question Time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
In so doing, they add value to Europe.
¬†¬† .
This represents a great change.
This is a sound premise for success.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Cooperation has been excellent.



That is the first step.
¬†¬† .
We stand right behind these figures.
I would like to highlight a few points.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Congratulations, Mrs Gr√∂ner!
Thank you.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We fully understand that concern.
Already the refusal rate is 70% to 75%.
This is a paltry amount!
Globalisation is an irreversible fact.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is a bad move.
Point duly made.
Thank you.
There will also be other reasons.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Position of the Commission
¬†¬† .
There are 77 amendments.
There are three groups of amendments.
¬†¬† .

Apart from that, what else has changed?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you.
Of course not.
¬†¬† .
It has an economic dimension.
This is the Europe that we cherish.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
On this we can all readily agree.
I feel this is unjustified.
To do so would be wrong.
One example is ferrous metals.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
Annex ‚Äì Position of the Commission
¬†¬† .
What is this amendment about?
The common position is disappointing.
This is an environmental issue.
I thank Mrs Doyle for her work.
It has been a very interesting debate.
I also thank Commissioner Dimas.
That is most important.
Thank you for your support.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
Annex ‚Äì Position of the Commission
Regulation (2003/0189A (COD))
Directive (2003/0189B (COD))
The essential questions are clear.
Those are the facts of the matter.
I have sworn to do so.
I make no distinction between them.
I have never hidden these views.
No single system has only advantages.
We should embrace it.
We have a Union of 25 Member States.
That is what this is about.
By that shall we be judged.


Where, in fact, do you stand on that?
To that we are opposed.
The EU is like a football team.
This is a strategic choice.
This is now under severe threat.
But what do we see happening?
That is my first observation.
Why?
He is saying the same thing today.
No.
Is it more protectionist?
Is it discriminatory?
The answer is no.
What is it you are advocating now?
Yes, a race to the bottom.
You should think carefully.
Employees are not commodities.
What is the money we create for?
They lost, however.
They most certainly do.
Take note or fail.
¬†¬† .
Do they have the right to strike?
There is no doubt about it.
We must strictly abide by the Treaties.
In fact, there are 25 of us now.
That is the issue at stake.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
These plans must seek to:
- avoid panic among the general public;

Do we have 25%?
All this has to be done.
¬†¬† .

I shall close here.
They need to be informed and reassured.
We need capacity and speed.
We have seen that.
There is no pandemic.
Is there an epidemic?
Perhaps there is no epidemic either.
Has the virus attacked man?
Yes it has.
Is there a vaccine?
So will we give them all an allowance?
Tomorrow we debate the budget.
We need to be aware of it!
Money is therefore required.
We have to be ready.
This is not panic-mongering.
Who has responsibility for this?
I am quite sure that we share it.
¬†¬† .
I mentioned that last time.
Sometimes the media exaggerate.
That is a risk we have to take.
We have to be realistic about that.
That will happen.
The debate is closed.
The threat of a pandemic is real.
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.

Why not say it?
We must not be afraid of globalisation.
We are building our partnership.
Thank you very much for inviting me.
¬†¬† That concludes voting time.
Hence our vote against the report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Well, that is propaganda.
¬†¬† I welcomed this report.
¬†¬† .
I have cut off your microphone.
A great deal of progress is required.
I think that is quite tremendous.
So let us consider the justice system.
The moment of truth has now arrived.
Allow me to single out two of them.
That is unacceptable.
We have often mentioned yellow cards.
What about the orphans and food safety?
Will it take action?
However, problems do exist.
Progress has continued in Bulgaria.
It is insufficient merely to pass laws.
There is no need yet.
I seek no time delay.
The criticism of them is justified.
You may well ask why this is so.

I shall focus on Rumania.
That too must be debated.
Proprietary rights cannot be enforced.


This is naturally unacceptable.
That is true, moreover.

Another heavy burden is the Roma issue.
Romania is still a long way from this.
However, the message must be clear.

This is not happening in Romania yet.
That is something we need to address.
¬†¬† .
They are in quite good shape.
¬†¬† The debate on this item is closed.
¬†¬† .
We have a piece of legislation here.
¬†¬† .
There are numerous examples.
Please be vigorous in chasing them up.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We await the findings of this inquiry.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is an interesting question.
If so, when did it do so?
¬†¬† .
The decision has not yet been taken.
¬†¬† .
We all agree.
That is the situation today.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The question is a very interesting one.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

Maybe you could answer this question.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is a matter for the Government.
¬†¬† .
Perhaps you can enlighten us?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We spoke about that.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Let me give just a few examples.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you for that answer.
I am interested in your review.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì I come from Scotland.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That concludes Question Time.
Human sperm cells are being patented.
That is most definitely excluded.
The designer patent is scandalous.
That bodes well for the future.
We should not consent to such a thing.
The precautionary principle must apply.
The debate is closed.
Then we can give it flat-out support.
That is the way to hit them hardest.
We should have done it a long time ago.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Catania.
The debate is closed.
That is one aspect.
That is a further aspect.
However, the document is contradictory.
Thank you.
Let us be clear.

We forget that in this debate.
That is the problem we have to face.
No State can take such decisions alone.
We must be realistic.
That is not the answer.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Let us be clear on this.
I should just like to add one comment.
That is welcome and desirable.
He has the broad support of our group.
That is the only question that matters.
¬†¬† .
A word now on the budgetary envelope.
These are Amendments 19 and 20.

¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I did not thank the rapporteur.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
We shall examine
First, what is the budget?
I shall give you some examples.
My second example is research.
Lastly, external actions.
¬†¬† .
Thank you for your attention.
¬†¬† .
There are no vacant posts left.
We are doing our best.
¬†¬† .
The earthquake represents a challenge.
They have no tents, food or water.
I do not know.
I would like that to be noted.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I should like to make three points.
What happened?
We got nothing!
The five proposals were all rejected.
That is in all our interests.
For that we need money.
The answer, of course, is no.
¬†¬† .
This situation cannot continue.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is not the case.
Quite right too!
Our word should be our bond.
I just want to make four points.

However, that is not enough.
This is a big mistake.
When?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is Voting Time.

1.
2.
¬†¬† .
The legal base is an important issue.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I welcome this.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We are against this particular point.
That is all well and good.
How is this growth measured?
No.
¬†¬† .



It is no such thing.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We should learn from our past mistakes.

Thank you, Mr Blair.
You have the floor.
¬†¬† .
The question is how we do that.
I should like to mention some of those.
The third area concerns universities.
We need to take those lessons further.
That is our desire.
¬†¬† .
Let me underline some of those aspects.
People are not statistics.
¬†¬† .
Nowadays, everything is interconnected.
I have made many visits to Morocco.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
As my German friends tell me, it is .
But do not give up.
That means high ideals.
It is followership.

¬†¬† .
Everything is fine up to that point.
Go on, laugh.
So what has happened since?
So it all looks rather encouraging.
¬†¬† .
It is good to see you, Sir.
¬†¬† .
That is a very good social record.
Again, I understand.
All of this is true.
Why?
That is what this debate is about.
However, we can re-train, re-skill.
Why should we not be confident?
Of course not!
Let Europe be relevant on these issues.
Let us agree the Commission paper.
We can do it.
They are posing the questions.
Time is short, winter approaches.
We wait for some real results.
I am obliged to him for saying this.
Just do it!
We are waiting for you.
Zero progress.
For them, you are too modern.
For us, you are not modern enough.
However, I shall have another go.
I would like to end by saying:
The constitution has broken down.
The budget has broken down.
The inspiration has broken down.
Do not disappoint them!
Stop disappointing them!
That would be a good start.
It is nothing but empty rhetoric.
Thank you Mr¬†Blair!
I hope that will happen at the summit.

What, then, should we do?
Hopes rose in the new Member States.
The deadlock needs to be broken.
We are running out of time.
Instead of delivery we have vision.
Please think it over.
¬†¬† .
Mrs De Sarnez raised the same question.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the item.
How very cynical!
¬†¬† .
That is far from being the case.
¬†¬† . The simple answer is ‚Äòyes‚Äô.
¬†¬† .
Thank you for that reply.
The European Union is ready to help.
This is completely counterproductive.
¬†¬† Thank you for your response.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We will work to achieve that.
I know because I was there.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
My question is a follow-up.
I would urge you to do that.
That concludes Question Time.
¬†¬† .
Its presence was extremely important.
What should the compact do?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
These plans must not be forgotten.

¬†¬† .
These are combat operations.
¬†¬† .

More European states could do the same.
Thank you.
They had no education.
We cannot give up.
The country is desperately poor.

¬†¬† .
There are no clear party blocks.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Any electoral improvement is welcome.
¬†¬† .
It is a very complicated question.
They only wanted one of their own.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
But history is history.
One is education.
¬†¬† .
I do hope that we will accomplish that.

¬†¬† .
The results, 10 years on, are mixed.
The region is still unstable.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

What is missing are the governments.
Where are the governments?
It could be a win-win situation.
For some, this may be confusing.
Let me explain.
Why is that so important?
There, I am very hopeful.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
‚ÄòWhich right has been violated?‚Äô
What is this saying?
¬†¬† .
That is a fact that cannot be ignored.
¬†¬† .
Why is this so?
¬†¬† .
I have asked for further information.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Swoboda.
We take good note of your request.
¬†¬† We shall now proceed to the vote.
I entirely agree.
¬†¬† Then we shall proceed as planned.
¬†¬† Is there any opposition?
We are not voting on the amounts.
There is only a remark on it.
We will vote on the figures later.
¬†¬† You are absolutely right.
We shall proceed as planned.
It is the whole row.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
Amendment 263:
Amendment 440:
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
They were aimed at:
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I welcome this report.
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That has not been done.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is fair enough.
¬†¬† .
That would have created a precedent.
Let me move on to the matter in hand.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This motion goes some way towards that.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† . Mr President, I apologise.
¬†¬† .
This is the true road to democracy.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That has not happened.
There is no other option.
¬†¬† .
This is not the case, however.
We must do more, however.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† The vote is closed.
A slight amendment has been proposed.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Ku≈∫miuk.
It has spread throughout Europe.
Your words were much appreciated.
Time is pressing.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mrs Stihler.
He founded a liberal, secular party.
The situation is grim and it is urgent.
He married and had four children.
I take pity on Europe and France.
A colleague spoke about it earlier.

You may do so directly if you wish.
I invite it to do so again.
¬†¬† .
Society as a whole benefits from this.
It must also invest in people.
¬†¬† .
The WTO must become more democratic.
What do we get out of it?
What is going well in Europe?
What do we get out of it?
What do we get out of it?
Everything comes from China.
This is the reality.
How can we safeguard viable pensions?
It is equal to an MEP's per diem.
This is the reality.
What are the results?
By exploiting people.
How can small retailers survive?
How can artisans survive?
Two weeks ago I was in Nairobi.
The Lisbon process, which is a failure?
That is the good thing about it.
What, then, of the ILO?
However, that is not enough by itself.
In my view, the keyword is ‚Äò‚Äô.
That is emphatically not the case.
No one.
It will do no such thing!
Clearly, something must be done.
‚Äì The debate is closed.
Globalisation must benefit everyone.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is a considerable advantage.
Schools, too, are in difficulties.
Our society has changed.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
The precedents are not encouraging.
¬†¬† .
The debate is a first step.
Why?
The Commission did nothing.
This must not be allowed to happen.
Shall we allow them to do so?
This must be answered.
The law is unambiguous and binding.
Terror may not be fought with terror.
That is not Europe‚Äôs way.
You are not investigating it.
The end does not justify the means.
We must defend our values.
No, we do not.
No, we do not.
No, we do not have those powers.
At present, we do not have these items.
I state that for the record.
The debate is closed.
This was a very disappointing result.
Where does that leave us now?
That was our first setback.
¬†¬† . Here we go again.
I suggest two solutions.
We owe these former colonies.
Thirdly, time is running out.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .


It is not a ‚ÄòLamfalussy‚Äô directive.
The directive fulfils this objective.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It sounds rather unsavoury to me.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We will go ahead with our proposals.
Certainly I agree with these remarks.
¬†¬† .
And on the outside?
A great loss of credibility.
A scandal.
More of the same. Very bad.
And the Member States?
Where is the British Presidency?
The Council spends 80%.
Where is the British Presidency?
This really is scandalous.
The Member States are happy.
They are pleased with themselves.
They are not even here.
That is obviously a good thing.
It is simply not good enough.
The first task was to explode myths.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Mr President, here we go again.
My conscience is clear.
Is yours, I ask?
Enough said.
It has made a lot of improvements.
That is simply not the case.
I have never come across one yet.
¬†¬† .
The Member States know about them too.
This is where we should start.
On the contrary, we want no such thing.
These objectives remain pertinent.
What are the key actions for 2006?
I agree.
We want the round to succeed.
There must be balance.
The market alone is not enough.

Let us be frank.
We need a fair sharing of this burden.
I hope it finds your active support.
Quite the contrary.
¬†¬† .
That, too, is an absolute necessity.
¬†¬† .
Just a suggestion!
We must choose peace, not war.
Drafting a legislative programme.
To deal with what?
The social dimension is very small.
Allow me to discuss a couple of these.
We have instruments at European level.
We have seen nothing of all this.
That too is conspicuous by its absence.
Please concentrate on civil justice.
The ‚Äòno‚Äô votes should be respected.
We will follow it up very closely.
That is on page¬†27 of the document.
The market cannot manage on its own.
Good.
Agreed.
I am not taking powers away from you.
I await your response.
The first is the Financial Perspective.
This work is now beginning.
On this subject, we must be honest.
We are fully committed to this agenda.
We agree on that.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mrs¬†Gr√∂ner.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour of it.
¬†¬† .
This is indeed the case.
¬†¬† .

What works best is not clear.
What is wanted is more research.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
That will be the day.
¬†¬† Mr President, I shall be brief.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I fully support this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I now turn to evaluation.
We believe we can.
Let us not throw it away.
I am particularly proud of this.
I am optimistic about this.
This is what we have done.
I therefore lend my backing to it.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Let us not spoil it.
Never.
We cannot spoil it.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
One thing still causes me concern.
¬†¬† .
Humans are, nevertheless, mortal.
That is weakness, in my view.
Finally, Sacconi‚Äôs apple.
¬†¬† .
Volume and risk go hand in hand.
That remains a major problem.
¬†¬† .
The key to this debate is balance.
However, we cannot yet be certain.
A nightmare!
The two are directly connected.
EU measures are thus justified.
However, we do not know which is which.
Industry needs certainty and clarity.
Why is this?
What are the advantages of REACH?
How is the product used?
How can it be identified?
Myself, I call that a defeat.
We all took up the challenge of Lisbon.
They are everywhere.
They are in our clothes.
They are in our cars.
They are even in our children‚Äôs toys.
I urge you to support my amendments.
It also makes it less clear.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
These are Amendments 1 to 4.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The number has grown enormously.
What of accountability?
We vote their budget.
¬†¬† .
What should such a framework cover?
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
Could you explain why?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I want to say two things.
¬†¬† .
Indeed, a number are already underway.
¬†¬† .
I shall give you the figures.
¬†¬† .
I do not believe so.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is very important.
¬†¬† .
They are what we are required to do.
That is what I believe we are doing.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The investigation has made progress.
All that is in progress.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
However, the investigation continues.
¬†¬† .
I very much agree.
That concludes Question Time.
¬†¬† .
It is a mixed picture, frankly.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I hope that date is coming closer.
It is a joint challenge.
This applies to Turkey.
The practice towards Cyprus.
¬†¬† .
I would certainly agree.
My second point concerns Kosovo.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
This is a fine outcome.
¬†¬† .
So the process was extremely positive.
I regard that as key.
¬†¬† .
This is an absolute right.
Thank you, Mrs de Veyrac.

This is very important.
More and more people are flying.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
This text therefore goes a long way.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
EU financing is needed for these.
In terms of how much money, though?
We are proposing EUR 400 million.
For cooling!
We need a new energy policy.
Past mistakes are expensive.
Will we treat it as such?

¬†¬† .
That is a fact.
Taxpayers?
Other citizens?
This really is a global challenge.
That is a very relevant issue.
I am really pleased it was so detailed.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
That is unacceptable.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
I truly meant it.
Today, the Iraqis have a constitution.
Iraq will be a federal Iraq.
It is the matter of security.
¬†¬† .
It is no such thing.
That is a simple matter of justice.
¬†¬† .
I have three specific concerns.
What kind of example are we setting?
Europe must work towards that goal.
¬†¬† .
Do you know what white phosphorus is?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


An investigation must be carried out.
¬†¬† .
We should not let Iraq down.
¬†¬† .
We cannot continue looking backwards.
What would the alternative be?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The results are encouraging.
What are our objectives in Montreal?
We must, then, involve other actors.
We must establish long-term goals.
That is quite incomprehensible to me.
There is a lot to do in this area.
We simply use too much fossil energy.
Nice words are not enough, however.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We need to do better and do more!
It is a huge challenge.
This is a tragic truth.
We cannot put up barbed wire fences.
There is even a sense of urgency.
There is no one ideal solution.
I call on you not to hold it up.
Let us move on to actions.
Even more important is the lifestyle.
The diagnosis has been made.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We will not act in this manner.
¬†¬† .
We need targets.
Thank you very much.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is voting time.
Nothing so far has happened.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That was decided long ago.
¬†¬† ‚Äì That concludes voting time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What is the spirit of this proposal?
I thank everybody for their support.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted for this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our abstention.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .The climate is changing.
¬†¬† .
The fourth concern was energy.
I do not call that an open market.
This is not the case.
Why not?
That cannot be right.
But the debate is far from finished.
¬†¬† .
We must now move on with our work.
All the options must remain open.
Not at all.
But now I have to speak about money.

We need a fair sharing of this burden.
Hampton Court was indeed a success.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Goebbels.
I seek a clear answer from you.
Thank you for your attention.
¬†¬† .
Why abandon this draft?
¬†¬† .
It has become too large and divided.
This is a trend that must be reversed.
I think that is asking a lot.
Today, there is a vacuum.
That is no good at all.
I have looked at the statistics.
However, there are 58¬†million of them.
¬†¬† .
We all have responsibility for this.
Moreover, it is better to be flexible.
Why?
That is a fact.
That is the problem.
We are working through it.
UK Presidency: no progress.
No, I say, they are not.
The big question is how to do all this.
It just carries on regardless.
What is being done about all this?
The budget was mentioned.
Apparently you want us to pay more.
Did you consider this at Hampton Court?
¬†¬† .
For that I am grateful.
With that I would have no disagreement.
¬†¬† .
Let us be frank.
And that is the point.
Are we ready?
Are we able to do it?
Can we deliver?
Of course it is not.
That is the great challenge.
I believe it is possible.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
These are deeply troubling statements.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is our way.
That is only the dialogue ...
This wall must also be taken down.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Frankly it is clear what Iran must do.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you Mr President.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That is rather inadequate.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Why, and for how long?
Why?
Will it be changed and when?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you for your response.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† I thank the President-in-Office.
We already know the British position.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
So much for the historical review.
¬†¬† .
I regard this as the right approach.
¬†¬† .
Mr President, I will do my best.
¬†¬† .
What are we to make of this?
¬†¬† .
We can also endorse her arguments.
That is our question to the Commission.
¬†¬† .
The standards here are not humane.
I am of the opposite view.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
¬†¬† .
The figures are clear.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
The area is not new to the Commission.
Let me now turn to defence procurement.
This would be neither quick nor easy.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The rapporteur has done a sterling job.
Means must be linked to ends.
Secondly, the heading is incorrect.
Arms are dangerous.
Arms are not toys.
Now to come to the point.
The answer is ‚Äòno‚Äô.
What needs to be done, therefore?
Contracts must be transparent.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
I should like to congratulate them.
Here we go.
Good luck.
¬†¬† We have noted your request.
¬†¬† Granted, Mr Bonde.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† , .
I hereby request an individual vote.
That, then, is my oral amendment.
¬†¬† That concludes Question Time.
We do need to test chemicals.
Therefore I could not vote for it.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
1.
2.
3.
4.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Long may it so remain.
Those days are over.
¬†¬† .
We have antibiotics to show us that.
Hence my vote in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† I voted for this Report.
¬†¬† .
How much, then, is being produced?
The report leaves no room for doubt.
Not for much longer perhaps.
¬†¬† .
I welcome its proposals.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted for this resolution.
Has there been any threat of sanctions?
Not one.
No, that‚Äôs not on the agenda.
Let us make things clear.
That is the reason why I abstained.
¬†¬† .
This is no time for rhetoric.
I must, however, make two observations.
This can only be applauded.
A new strategy is therefore needed.
Why not?
It is also a future demographic power.
One Europe: Europe has also changed.
I should like to raise one point.
Such action does not come cheap.
How can we recommend such measures?
We could debate this together.
It would be worthwhile.
This is not insignificant.
I think that we agree on the principle.
In conclusion, I assume so.
I have to be pragmatic.
The result?
I agree wholeheartedly.
I therefore share this point of view.
I have nothing to reply on this point.
The debate is closed.
That is not a credible way to act.
What is it all about?

¬†¬† .
I am therefore not ideological.
We are right to do so.
¬†¬† .
That is what the debate covers.
No, you are not going to trap me.
I will not fall into that trap.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
People‚Äôs lives depend upon it.
Kashmir is one of these cases.
Perhaps there are some positive signs.
¬†¬† .
It is a must for all of us.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
He was five centimetres too short.
These are two entirely separate issues.
This is a different matter altogether.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Any form of dissidence is forbidden.
We need a real ceasefire.
We currently have eight.
Perhaps.
Is that pie in the sky?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.
Therefore, that is a piece of nonsense.
I believe that this is quite clear.
Mr¬†Posselt was perhaps not present.
We were here; we heard Mr¬†Wijkman.
That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
Despite that, she has been kidnapped.
26¬†million people are infected there.

That is not acceptable.
That would then be a compromise.


That is a great potential prize.
We are far from where we hoped to be.


Of course we will.
But they must do something.
That is the principle of this round.
I hope that they will do likewise.



¬†¬† .
Should we search our own hearts?
I do not think so.
¬†¬† .
Thirdly, I will mention agriculture.
Is that fair?
Is that a fair system?
It is not and cannot be!
The offer is not perfect.
On that, Commissioner, we are with you.


I really cannot believe that.
What kind of benchmarking is that?
Why?
The results are enormously impressive.
That is what the EU package is about.
It must be balanced.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Let me take Cambodia first.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

All is very far from well.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
This is implemented at three levels.
¬†¬† .
I fully agree with Mrs Martens.
This is already the case.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Sport is an excellent tool for this.
¬†¬† .
Sports transcends all boundaries.
I support this resolution.


There you go.
Was this a romantic move?
Surely not for the children.
Romantic?
Only the Olympic Games managed it.
There is no reason why we should not.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
That is totally unacceptable.
Perhaps there will be another occasion.
What then?
I think not.
What exactly has he achieved?
Nothing!
¬†¬† I would not be at all surprised!
The matter is under negotiation.
Let us protect the institutions.
I repeat, who are legally employed.
¬†¬† That concludes the item.
¬†¬† .
They are two separate issues.
I will now turn to the amendments.
I shall try to speed up this process.
¬†¬† .
We are all happy to do this.
This is not a party political issue.
It is a great opportunity.
How are these diseases getting in?
We must look at that very closely.
¬†¬† .
Sadly, that is how it is.
¬†¬† .
The threat to humans is not new either.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We salute him for that.
There is no data available on this.
More can be done within the EU too.
¬†¬† .
I would like to touch on a few issues.
We do not discourage vaccination.
This is very important.
We have synergies and coordination.
The systems worked and that is good.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
Amendments No: 2, 4(1), 4(2)
¬†¬† .
This is a normal principle of law.
¬†¬† .
There are many positive points.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Developing medicines costs money.
¬†¬† .
That must be made absolutely clear.
¬†¬† .
That is the good news.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
I commend the report to the House.


¬†¬† .
That is very important.
It is something relatively new.
It was not in the original Treaties.
We have built that up ourselves.
That gives extra flexibility.
The procedure has worked well.
It works.
I also welcome his comments.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is a universal principle of law.
A useful precedent has been set.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The current exemption is unique.
EU shipping lines are faring well.

¬†¬† .
Is it already ready?
We hope it will be heard.
¬†¬† .
This strikes me as a misconception.
There is no free competition.
Today, things have changed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
A few words about the future.
¬†¬† .
That is not regularly enough.
¬†¬† .
There are many examples of this.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
¬†¬† .
My second report concerns VAT refunds.
This is the content of our amendments.
¬†¬† .
This is still the case.
However, there are some conditions.
¬†¬† .
Anyway, everyone knows what is coming.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Is this really what we want?
Taxes steer.
Is this madness?
An aberration?
It has created jobs.
Plenty of words and no action.


We need to do something here.
We need certainty in our law.
Uncertain law is bad law.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
Why have we ended up here?
Is Germany wrong?
No.
I thank the Commissioner for his offer.
Have I understood that correctly?
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.
I hope the House will agree to that.
¬†¬† .
I would like to put that to the House.
The text reads as follows:
What is the justification for this?
I ask for the House‚Äôs backing for it.
They are the wrong way round.
¬†¬† That concludes voting time.
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
Unemployment.
Increased living costs.
Absurd budgetary constraints.
A dramatic rise in government debt.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted for this report.
¬†¬† .
World trade is unequal.
It is unfair.

That is all that is at stake¬†...
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I voted for this resolution.
It is just a College of civil servants.
That is the situation.
Thank you very much for your attention.
(1)
We feared the worst. We were not wrong.
If you wish to do so, you know how.
I would ask for your understanding.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Our Assembly is not a court.
Mrs¬†Wallis‚Äô report is balanced.
I hope that you succeed in doing this.
¬†¬† .
What hypocrisy and what lies!
That is totally incorrect.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Be in no doubt about this.
¬†¬† .
I have these two items with me today.
We support it.
I do not agree with an automatic ban.
I will support the common position.
The rules are already very strict.
Mrs¬†Jackson quoted some figures.
She forgot about Luxembourg.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What is this about?
Not everyone understands it.
Why do we want to extend them?
So what do we do now?
Why is this so?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I shall concentrate on that.
¬†¬† .
Let me refer to another issue.
¬†¬† .
This is about citizens‚Äô rights.

We do not want to see this again.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Let me remind you of a few examples.

Such are the consequences.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What is good about this directive?
However, we must not be complacent.
This directive is really necessary.
So, by doing, you learn something.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
There are two reasons in particular.
Fiscal matters are very problematic.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The report is ambitious.
¬†¬† .
What causes the concern then?
¬†¬† .
It does not make sense.
My recommendation is leave it alone.
That is not the case.
This is erroneous.
¬†¬† .
I will say no more at this stage.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We refuse to accept this.
¬†¬† .
First, there is the budget.
¬†¬† .
Therefore we need action, not words.
I propose that the report be accepted.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
I hope it will be here later.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Watson.
¬†¬† .
We all know what is at stake this week.
The Commission has set out its ideas.
Parliament has done the same.
Now we are waiting for the Council.
Policies delayed are policies denied.
The Commission is playing its role.
We need an ambitious Europe.
But we must be coherent.
It needs action.
And action needs means and instruments.
I remain convinced of that.
This creates a very unfortunate effect.
I welcome Parliament‚Äôs position.
¬†¬† .
But Europe has responded.
¬†¬† .
I hope that it will.
¬†¬† .
They, too, said, ‚ÄòWhat?
The British proposal gives it 44%.
The symbol was, of course, the .
Today, we are on the .
Certainly not 1.03%.
That is the centre of the iceberg.
Mr Alexander, that is what I wish.
¬†¬† .
This is not just a budget for tomorrow.
I wish you success.
¬†¬† .
I find that very, very interesting.
Nuclear energy!
Do not stay in the 1960s.
Do you understand?
¬†¬† .
Perhaps it is the abuse, I do not know.
Yes, honestly!
We are always holding you up.
We are always stopping you.
Get rid of us!
Kick us out!
Expel us!
Minister, you mentioned terrorism.
We do not subscribe to your project.
This is not a parliamentary democracy.
That was never intended.
Mr Putin would feel perfectly at home.
So we should!
Will that be a vain hope?
But then the cuts will come, as always.
Thank you.
The ball lies in your court.
Christmas is coming.
I was wrong.
We do not want charity.
We are not beggars.
We want our money back.
That is blackmail.
We had to be disappointed.
This is not worthy of Europe.
¬†¬† .
We tabled an options paper last month.
This is no zero-sum game.
¬†¬† Colleagues, please be quiet.
Our debate is not yet over.
¬†¬† .
We sincerely hope for more.
Why?
I think not ‚Äì that is not fair.
I believe a deal is possible.
It is difficult but it is possible.
I believe a deal is important.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Barroso.
Behold the unmasked EU!
Congratulations, Mr President.
¬†¬† We shall proceed to the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.

The fight against inhuman laws.
They are well known to us.
Mrs Hauwa Ibrahim:
We admire your determination.
We admire your personal commitment.
Without it there can be no democracy.
In 2004 that figure was 53.
Unfortunately, it is increasing.
Voltaire and Brecht are watching us.
Thank you very much.
Mrs Blanca Reyes, you have the floor.
¬†¬† ‚Äò.

Vaclav Havel‚Äô.
Havana, 14 December 2005.
We were focused and we stayed focused.
We do not know.
That is what we knew.
We never dress the same way twice.
I was afraid, of course.
There were eight mullahs.
I did not sit on the chair.
I walked towards them.
Sit on that chair‚Äô.
I am a stupid lawyer.
I did not know what I was doing.
I caught their attention.
And that was all I needed.
Nothing more.
We needed safety.
We needed them to listen to us.
We needed to carry them along with us.
We needed to engage them.
This is part of the strategy.
And that is my passion.
They are illiterate and poor.
We need you to help us with your voice.
It has to be reformed.
Our methodology will be flexible.
Thank you so much.
¬†¬† .
Thank you, Jean-Marie.
That is not my problem.
That is all!
How unfair for the others, though.
That is not democracy, however.
No, they are not the same thing.
We do in fact live in democracies.
Democracies exist.
It is a despicable thing to do to them.
Yes, we need to reflect.
That is happily not the case.
We need you, you know.
We rely on your doing so.
Speak the truth.
That is the only thing we ask of you.
We have heard enough quivering voices.
This injustice is unacceptable.
The fact that it works.
I am not saving my soul.
To do that, we need you.
Where were you on 17 March?
Whom did you meet?
Whom did you sit beside?
Did you sit beside a known criminal?
It is also ineffective.
¬†¬† .
Why do they think that?
Hence our vote against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is an approach we owe Europeans.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hurried law is usually bad law.
It has many defects.
The question of costs is unclear.
Hotmail and Yahoo emails are excluded.
So much "Spam" email is sent.
This is an unsatisfactory law.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Torture is abhorrent.
The prohibition against it is absolute.
The Council welcomes this statement.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† You wicked girl!
¬†¬† .
No, indeed not.
¬†¬† .
Where were they detained?
What was their status?
This is not the truth.
We have a right to know the truth.

¬†¬† .
They are a reality with which we live.
Indeed, we condemn it.
These are not just words.
That will be my personal commitment.
The debate is closed.
Their accession is already secured.
They are making an increased effort.
I commend my report to Parliament.
Then there is the issue of minorities.
¬†¬† .
Much has happened in the past year.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Our amendment stresses that fact.
This initiative deserves our support.
The reports pass over this issue.
Please allow me to give an example.
Why is this the case?
That is not the Europe I know.
It is important that we remember this.
That would be a wonderful symbol.
We need to address it.
I share the concerns of colleagues.
We represent their best hope.
¬†¬† .
I do not accept either charge.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
¬†¬† .



That single seat is Strasbourg.
¬†¬† .
This includes common policies.
There is a world of a difference.
Who gains?
Because not everyone gains equally.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† This is a very serious issue.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Question Time is closed.
¬†¬† .
The first declaration reads:
¬†¬† .
We have achieved all these goals.
This is very much to be welcomed.
This is a real shame.
That was eighteen months ago.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .


That focus has been lost.
Commissioner, thank you for listening.
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
We still have a long way to go.
There is still a lot to do, however.
I am also indebted to the Commissioner.
Why is that so important?
Women often trade in, and buy, fish.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Value for money for the third country?
¬†¬† .
Yet no such increase is forthcoming.
¬†¬† .
Just so.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
There must be proportionality.
That would greatly help.
This is unacceptable and unworkable.
You talked about a level playing field.
It does not exist.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì The joint debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
I shall now turn to the amendments.

¬†¬† .
What are we doing here?
This situation is intolerable.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† We shall proceed to the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Alright, that concludes the vote.
But the Minister is not here yet.
I rise under the precedent of Rule 145.
I beg the House‚Äôs indulgence.
It is a tremendous vote in favour.
¬†¬† .
It is an important oral amendment.
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
The wording is also fairly unclear.
¬†¬† .
In 2005, France paid EUR 16.7¬†billion.
1.
2.
¬†¬† .

We voted in favour of this initiative.
It is the least we can do.
¬†¬† .
The figures speak for themselves.
This amount is obscene.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We therefore opted to abstain.
Aid to Georgia
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We have to allow this to continue.
It does not stop there, however.


We therefore opted to abstain.
¬†¬† .
However, we have a problem.
¬†¬† .
But what is their crime?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† , .

¬†¬† , .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
It also goes against international law.
It can show that changes can be made.
¬†¬† .
Lebedev is seriously ill.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I hope reason prevails.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you Mr President.
Thank you.
¬†¬† .
Let me begin with Chechnya.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Reports get worse and worse.
It will need to be a very big field.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
Dear Phillip, we will all miss you.
Several have attempted suicide.
This should not be the case.

It is unimaginable.
This is clearly a slight.
We want the right of coexistence.

That concludes this item.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
A lot of pressure needs to be applied.
We must get rid of that.
¬†¬† .
Nothing.
Thank you.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Take the Liberals.
I am gay.
Why?
Where is the morality in that?
Of course he killed others too.
The debate is closed.
It is a very brief question.
¬†¬† .
I hope that this will happen.
We cannot ignore this.
Answer for yourselves.
¬†¬† .
I will mention five of them.
¬†¬† .
It involves all of us.
I therefore welcome this report.
¬†¬† .
This exemption is not being respected.
Citizenship belongs to nation states.
No European law is needed for that.
I do not want it.
This report proves that beyond doubt.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
They also need help to rejoin society!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I am in favour of criminalising demand.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
That is not what I am discussing.
Who is to blame?

It was surely inevitable.
We need a clear legal basis.
I concur with that 100%.
¬†¬† Madam President,
We must continue in this direction.
Women and children are the victims.
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.


¬†¬† .
I want to do that.
That is not a negligible achievement.
This has to be minimised.
We will be very vigilant on this.
I really hope this is the case.
These are my preliminary thoughts.
This effort unites us.
It is a common challenge.
Much remains to be done.
It certainly delivered on this.
And push we must.
We can do good.
Now is the time to be ambitious again.
Let the EU lead and hope others follow.
What next, then, for the negotiations?
I hope you will take that message back.
This is no zero-sum game.
I detect two worrying reactions.
That would be a big mistake.
What a disappointment!
Those are positives.
Those are essential.
It is a formidable list.
Has it been a complete failure?
No.
Has it been a complete success?
No.
This is an important point.
¬†¬† .
I cannot do them all justice.


In my view that is very important.
In my view GIs are of vital interest.
Why?
Because multilateralism is important.
I am not ignoring the bilateral agenda.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .

The period of inquiry is over.
However, we cannot rest on our laurels.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Businesses also need one.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
You are Mr¬†Barroso‚Äôs guide.
¬†¬† .
I shall make brief comments.


The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
¬†¬† .
Thank you for listening.
¬†¬† .
The idea of self-handling is ludicrous.
Pilotage was included in this proposal.
¬†¬† .
It could deal with this on its own.
Down with the confrontation model.
Long live the consultation model.
¬†¬† .
Let me now turn to the matter in hand.
Why is this so?
The answer is quite simple.
There is no reason to do so.
That is simply not on.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Consequently¬†‚Ä¶
¬†¬† .
These are big numbers.
The House should throw it out.

They do nothing of the sort.
That is my appeal to them.
Our ports are privately owned.
Who really wants this directive?
What are you trying to do?
We know how they operate.
There is a positive modus operandi.
The best proposal is to withdraw it.
It is therefore unacceptable.
Thank you for your attention.
¬†¬† .
We need efficient and modern ports.
That is the situation, however.
That is your rapporteur‚Äôs theory.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
There are two ways of going about this.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr¬†Titley.
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.
1.
2.
3.
¬†¬† .
The important thing now is to use it.
¬†¬† .
This was indeed madness.
Europe should not interfere in this.
¬†¬† .
Where will this madness end?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is not enough, however.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Are there any objections?
Would you please make a note of that?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The issue has not gone away.
We have adopted ambitious legislation.
Now it is time to implement it.
¬†¬† .
We should, however, move beyond that.
Reality calls for courage.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
A great deal of change is needed here.
¬†¬† .
That is quite an achievement.
Not one.
As I said, I will keep it brief.
Are there any possible alternatives?
It is not a company.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The same is true for renewable energy.
The same applies to Moldova.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Sugar policy has many facets.
That makes an absolute mockery of EBA.
¬†¬† .
This had three main elements.
¬†¬† .
Of course it does not.
We have presented proposals for this.
We must not deceive ourselves, however.
Why should they have to do so?
The upshot of all this is clear to all.
It should be new and fresh funds.
That is clearly in order.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you for the question.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We have two options.
¬†¬† .
Thank you for the question.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That concludes Question Time.
I shall just refer to prices.
But are we crazy?
Sugar has other uses besides sweets.
How can we accomplish anything?
How have these countries been selected?
I shall be keeping a close eye on this.
Is the Commissioner aware of that?
Is the Commission?
Firstly, in relation to C¬†sugar.
We do not need any more urban drift.
Let me first deal with the amendments.
I can accept that.
Many of you have mentioned bioethanol.
Nor can I accept the other amendments.
Therefore I cannot accept it.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
My group is divided over this issue.
Take a current example.
We saw this with REACH.
However, that is the way forward.
Some Members of this House oppose it.
I think that is quite obvious.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
Directives are very rarely perfect.
I am much obliged to him for this.
¬†¬† .
Thank you, Mr¬†Sj√∂stedt.
This is a success for us.
However, we lost an important battle.

¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
I only go in if I have no other choice.
He did a good job.
It just makes them less hazardous.
¬†¬† .
I support the directive.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
The list does not stop there.
We have much to do in this area.
¬†¬† .
I am opposed to this approach.
I therefore support this directive.
¬†¬† ¬†The debate is closed.
All of us have benefited.
It is also a matter of choices.
We need that balance.
There is no getting away from that.
I make no bones about this.
Why not?
This is European taxpayers‚Äô money.
We must work together on this.
I find that incredibly interesting.
It is not only about a document.
What connects us?
We must bring it to life.
They are a political matter.
This applies especially to Europe.
Europe is teamwork.
I wish you all the very best.
It must be earned.
We need to focus on delivery.
¬†¬† .
We shall not accept that either.
You spoke of openness and protection.
He will do that himself shortly.
Finally, energy was mentioned here.
Chancellor, you identified three aims.
That is Europe‚Äôs crisis.
That is what I cannot understand.
We want an agreement, Mr¬†Sch√ºssel.
It need not always involve more money.
Let us negotiate on that.
Europe also needs more red!
¬†¬† .
Liberals and Democrats agree.
You did not say that.
Wonderful!
We are for that too.
Are you for it or against it?
You have not told us.
Then we come to growth.
It is time we understood that.
¬†¬† .
You have inherited a minefield.
Good luck!
There lies the rub, in fact.

¬†¬† .
So carry on as best you can!
What a wonderful agenda!
We shall have to debate that as well.
Let us continue in that vein.
The money is actually there.
We do have EUR 112 billion.
Do that!
Take real action!
I could go on.
What about Danone and France?
Open the doors!
Transform yourself!
Become a European enlightener!
We say yes to the Services Directive.
Let us get to work!
There are many tests to be applied.
It has many facets.
Not a word did you say about that.
They are still here!
The Constitution failed to do that.
I wish you all good luck.
Is that not worthwhile?
I think it is.
Is it politically worthwhile?
Is it financially worthwhile?
What shows me that I am a European?
You are, after all, in charge of .
You are a team player.
You are used to playing a tough game.
Half of your ministers are women.
That would be a success.
You are sure to succeed.
Stand by what you believe in.
What is dead is dead.
We have many inferiority complexes.
What was its undoing?
You can count on our help.
That would be the last straw!
It amounts to 1.09% of GNP.
In the fight against terrorism?
Surely these exchanges are essential!
I do not think that is the way forward.
Can you explain how?
That is also a very important issue.
Keep that squarely in mind.
Mr¬†Sch√ºssel, I wish you luck.
Which of your colleagues can be right?
The first of these is energy security.
Maybe this is food for thought.
We need a more flexible budget.
Be wary of this Parliament.
Put a bit of extra money into that!
Why?
I refer to Iran, Russia and China.
Implement the Services Directive.
We have procrastinated long enough.
We must now take decisions.
Unfortunately, the budget is too small.
That is an important and basic premise.
¬†¬† .
I wish her all the best for the future.
Iran is an issue of the utmost concern.
That much is clear.
We can, however, get things started.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
This is not much, though.
Thank you, but I have to cut you off.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is voting time.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Please let me finish.
These men and women can count on us.
We are not in solidarity with them.
Vote ‚Äòyes‚Äô, and throw it out!
¬†¬† .
Mr¬†President, I will be brief.
That is my regret dealt with.
¬†¬† ‚Äì That concludes voting time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
1.
2.
3.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
That is regrettable.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

We have voted against Amendment¬†25.
Our Parliament was short-sighted today.
I was of a different opinion.
¬†¬† .
This is a denial of democracy.
It must be rejected.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


That is absurd.
This is fundamental for us.
I therefore condemn their ploys.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† , .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It ought to be so in actual practice.
It must do so again today.
¬†¬† .
I object to this.
This is why I voted against.
These rights are guaranteed under law.
It could well soon come true.
Paragraph 45:
The following are examples:
‚Äì environmental taxes at EU level;
‚Äì tax on labour in the Member States;
‚Äì employment and social integration.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is what this dispute is about.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I will limit my remarks to four points.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is absolutely vital.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What does this opinion say?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We need to turn that into a positive.
¬†¬† .
We need longer and deeper reflection.
What those measures are is left open.
This issue will not go away.
It is a serious problem.
It is not like that.
¬†¬† .
That is a step forward.
That is where the problem lies.
¬†¬† .
Why break your own rules?
The proposed Constitution is dead!
You continue to propagate the text.
No, you could not, could you?
¬†¬† .
Nonsense!
Why not face the truth?
You lost.
What, after all, is Nice all about?
Europe needs a new Treaty.
That is the reality.
Why?

Europe is now a thing of the past.
Nonetheless, we want to stay together.
Of that there can be no doubt.
There is no getting around that fact.
I should like to add one final comment.
The future allows us no room for fear.
Will the debate be able to move on?


It is time we got to work.
What is this work?

¬†¬† .
What we need now is a discussion.
The Presidency will respond to it.
It is not something we have invented.
How do we deal with that situation?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
It is dead.
This is scandalous and unacceptable.
¬†¬† I cannot support this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I remember my visit very well.
That is our task now.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
There are other proposals.
We cannot remain indifferent.
¬†¬† .
There is no doubt about that.
They simply were not.
I must emphasise this most strongly.
Strasbourg is our only hope.‚Äô
Lastly, today‚Äôs resolution ...
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We now have to look at it.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† We now come to Question Time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Do we have any options?
If so, what are they?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We think that the funding is adequate.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The Council endorsed this appointment.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The same is true in other areas.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We are doing our best.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That concludes Question Time.
But what does the privilege bring?
¬†¬† .
What do we want to do in the future?
¬†¬† .
I wonder why not.

The third principle is as follows.
We would do well to remember this.
It is worth highlighting this fact.
I am worried.
What are our priorities to be?
Today, the situation is different.
Let us not repeat the same mistake.
Let us speak about the ENP.
Let us call that system the ENP.
Point 4: Criteria.
Point 5: Institutions and our capacity.
Four freedoms should be analysed.
I will come to that in a moment.
That is very important.
That is what we are trying to do.
Another question referred to Belarus.
That is already under way.
Russia is not in the normal ENP.
Why?
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Firstly, simplifying bureaucracy.
We need to turn words into action.
¬†¬† .
All of us want to help you deliver.
A concrete proposal has been promised.
We are obliged to him for this.
¬†¬† .
Who could disagree with that?
¬†¬† .
That too would facilitate matters.
I fully agree with him.
How?
We should not neglect this foundation.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
I have kept one example to finish with.
¬†¬† .
That is not the case.
That is intolerable.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
I spent a whole day in Gaza.
They are very happy.
We want to make a long term commitment.
I clearly reiterated that.
¬†¬† .
But the key to stability is democracy.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The conclusions are, I think, obvious.
¬†¬† .
Will the Middle East become democratic?

¬†¬† Good morning, Mr President.
We know that.
Jerusalem is absolutely central.
I should like to acknowledge that duty.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, everyone.
¬†¬† .
How?
¬†¬† .
Things cannot go on like that.
So where is the snag?
¬†¬† .
This would help reduce unemployment.
This will not be achieved.
That is a great pity.
New approaches need to be found here.
¬†¬† .

They create jobs and wealth.
Could the solution come from Brussels?
I doubt it.

The reform is essential.
I hope this will be listened to.

It takes its inspiration from nihilism.
We have milk: they impose quotas.
We have vineyards: they tear them down.
For four years.
Long live death!

the stability of the EU market;
a less drastic reduction in prices;

But are we crazy?
Sugar has other uses besides sweets.
How can we accomplish anything?

I voted for this resolution.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Let the people decide
Their verdict must be respected.
The constitution is dead.

On that, then, we are in agreement.

The diagnosis has long been known.
In general, the disabled are also poor.
The relationship works both ways.
This should be remedied.
It is horrific!
I have seen and met these children.

Good luck, President Bachelet.

The negotiations are underway.

I believe they are worthy.
Let us start there.
Is it because Cambodia is too far away?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
It is the name of Chea Poch.
¬†¬† It is an addition, Mr President.
It is ‚Äòdefaming‚Äô, is it not?
That was my original intention.
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
This time they were Slovakian.
¬†¬† Are there any comments?
Mrs Frassoni has the floor.
¬†¬† All right, that will be done.
That was the first night of the year.






To do so would be a good decision.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
¬†¬† .

And that is just a small sample.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
I could not agree more.
This, therefore, has to be our aim.
It is a recipe that can work.
We have therefore tried to be flexible.
Early results are highly positive.
We know there will be new demands.
¬†¬† .
But so must Israel.
Most pressing is the question of Iran.
¬†¬† .
If we fail in that, then we will lose.
¬†¬† .
What can be observed?
Where are we with this matter today?
What should be done, then?
I have heard nothing on this matter.
¬†¬† .
The political message is crystal-clear.
¬†¬† .

I will not let diplomatic relations ‚Ä¶
But they were betrayed.
These concerns will now multiply.
This agenda sets itself.
Have we made mistakes?
Yes, there is a threat.
I shall begin with energy security.
I shall now move on to food security.
Food security is vital to them all.
Who says that Joschka Fischer changed?
But I have another point to make.
Gas has been used as a weapon.
That is crucial.
I agree with that.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We want to make this debate useful.
So take note of that!
Mr President, I leave it to you.
If you want to take it up, do so.
If you do not, then do not.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
¬†¬† .
That is beyond question.
¬†¬† .
Let me bear three elements in mind.
This will take time to become apparent.
But others, too, must play their role.
USD 35¬†million are still lying there.
¬†¬† .
We heard the noise of democracy.
¬†¬† .
I will mention two of them.
¬†¬† .
Millions of Palestinians are desperate.
We must respect this will.
That would be a recipe for failure.
Clearly, I share these opinions.
Yes, Hamas won.
Palestine is occupied.
Is the EU about bridges or barriers?
How have they acted since?
I beg to differ.
Do we have a plan to do so?
Hamas is a resistance movement.
What will we do then?
Under which conditions?
Do we have any plans?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We know why.
At the same time, they desire peace.
This has to be the way forward.
I very much wanted to mention this.
I met Mr Wolfowitz yesterday in London.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.




It must not do that.
We can wait no longer.
If they vote like me, all the better.
Europe could set a good example.
It would be absurd.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
I attended that hearing on both days.
Hopefully that fear has been allayed.
This is an important point.
Thank you for your attention!
It has not been possible.
Of course, this is completely untrue.
What is happening?
So publish it!
Who gets what, how much and when?
This question seems very technical.
Let us try to find solutions.
This is not true.
This is true.
This is a huge exercise.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
For many of us, this sea is our life.
We want fish stocks to be maintained.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you very much.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
The die is cast.
We cannot turn back.
May they rest in peace.
¬†¬† .
You may think this an exaggeration.
It is not.
What we need to do now is to act.
¬†¬† .
Every woman can be abused.
These are horrific figures.
We need to act.
So what can we do?
That is very important.
We have to break this vicious circle.
Violence cannot be a private matter.
Thank you for your attention!
¬†¬† The debate is closed.

The woman died of her burns.
The second cause is idleness.
The time has come for change.
I will highlight just three issues.
I suggest a level of 50% of women.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Postal services are a growth sector.
¬†¬† .
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
¬†¬† .
The UK does not want it!
Is this progress?
The British people do not want it.

¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Nor has the Commission done so.
I shall vote against this report.
¬†¬† .
That report is available to colleagues.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .

That is a challenge for policy makers.
Thank you for your attention.
¬†¬† .
Our ideas must be followed by action.
¬†¬† .
In communications less is more.
That is acceptable to us.
Only then can they be empowered.
¬†¬† .
You could propose this debate yourself.
¬†¬† .
First of all, action must follow.
This is about engaging citizens.
This is what it is all about.
It is called ‚ÄòEurope by Satellite‚Äô.
We do it in 20 languages.
This has been the idea from the outset.
They see a risk of competition.
I do not think this is a problem.
We have to be realistic.
There was no vote on this.
I am glad to be able to tell you that.
This is not only about voting.
We need to debate.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We will do this on a consensus basis.
¬†¬† .
The answer is no.
Is that too simple for the EU?
It has nothing to do with roads.
It is very embarrassing.
Firstly, tiredness kills.
That has to be the key to success.
And here we go again!
It is nothing of the sort!
I now think that we can feel satisfied.
Therein lies the problem.


¬†¬† I entirely agree with you.
I therefore share your regrets.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.
In the text, I quote in English,
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.

I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† We voted in favour of the report.
I have personal experience of this.
It was a powerless rage.
These centres are not prisons.
Violence is not a domestic matter.
¬†¬† .
That is where we must start.
We must put a stop to this cowardice.
Policy is not determined by gender.
Hence our vote against.
There is an issue of proportionality.
If we condemn Cuba,
I will have no part in it.
We have voted.
The vote cannot be invalidated.
That would be the sensible thing to do.
It just cannot be true!
This is therefore unfair competition.
It is our responsibility to respect it.
This is on 16 February.
Thank you.
In Parliament we are still waiting.
We need to press on down this road.
¬†¬† .
Does the Commission have any idea?
On that we agree.
¬†¬† .
Some chance, I would suggest!
These standards are needed.


They all have the same problem.
We must give consumers the choice.
I urge the Commission to do that.
It is a compromise.
Others say we have gone too far.
The other costs affect competitiveness.
We have letters; we have Eurobarometer.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.

¬†¬† .

That is just by the by.
¬†¬† .
Britain is far from rich as it is.
Public housing is another example.

That cannot be what aid is for.
The threshold is the right one.
None of us opposes competition.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
That was made clear on your side.
Aid should be less and better.
I am talking about less bureaucracy.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The same is true today.
¬†¬† .
Protectionism is not the answer.
For people first. With jobs.
Europe has a lot to offer.
Nothing is simply domestic any more.
Everyone will benefit!
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We need more action and fewer words.

The services directive is part of that.
¬†¬† .
It causes concern and apprehension.
The reason is simple.
We have no alternative.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

SOLVIT has been a success.
That is what SOLVIT is.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
So why was the report drafted?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you very much for your attention.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We have not given them legal certainty.
¬†¬† .
It has been a long, hard battle.
I congratulate Mrs Weisgerber.
¬†¬† .
Why should they not?
What do you think, Thomas?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Has this been properly thought out?
I think not.
I could give you more examples.
The answer is obvious.
There is a decision to be made.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It reinforces the Schengen border code.
That must be our approach.
Congratulations to all concerned.
We must live up to our values.
It addresses three important issues.
Therefore this is a very good proposal.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Subsidiarity is another key issue.
¬†¬† .
This was brief, but I wanted to say it.
Allow me to mention a few of them.
¬†¬† .
Why?
Their potential is particularly great.
I could not agree more.
What is the secret of this success?
¬†¬† .
I am also passionate about this report.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
That is why we have so many checks.
Can you help us on that, Mr H√∂kmark?
¬†¬† You are the rapporteur.
The next two parts fall.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is why we voted against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That, though, is the real problem.


¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
That is not acceptable.
¬†¬† .
We doubt it.
It is not a simple issue.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We have now come to a tricky corner.
¬†¬† .
That must be a goal for us all.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This can be done relatively quickly.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That we do know!
¬†¬† .
This Parliament must make a choice.
90% of service companies are SMEs.
We call it the ‚ÄòBerlin blockage‚Äô.
It is still in force.
¬†¬† .
We cannot endorse this draft directive.
¬†¬† .
Big deal!
In fact, nothing is less certain.
¬†¬† .
But, seven years on, what has happened?
We shall vote ‚Äòno‚Äô.
That is what we are fighting against.
¬†¬† .
I wonder if his own MEPs do.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is unworthy of a democracy.
¬†¬† .
Let us make good use of it.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I am bound to remind the House of this.
¬†¬† .
I am simply in awe.
That is not the end of it, though.
Why has it taken two years?
I do not think that is reasonable.
I think we can do that.
I would encourage them not to do so.
Not all services can be exported.
This is scandalous.
¬†¬† Thank you, Madam¬†President.
Little remains of that text now.

Europe needs this services directive.
¬†¬† .
For that reason, ...
Not if we can help it, Commissioner!
¬†¬† .
Both these processes must continue.
Ultimately they will have to merge.
That is our aim.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is particularly great in education.
¬†¬† .
We can be proud of that.
The position at present is as follows.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
When will the Council have a mandate?
¬†¬† .
I cannot be more precise.
All that is already under way.
We owe that to Europe‚Äôs citizens.
My question relates to that.
We must take all these approaches.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That concludes Question Time.
Will it cause a levelling down effect?
Sadly, this is not so.

Now is the time to do just that.
Is that democracy?
Let us vote down this directive.

We shall support the compromise.
We want a better Europe!
On Thursday we have two choices.

Anything else is marketing gone wrong.
Their action is scandalous.
It is expensive and ineffective.
My counter argument is as follows.
Is unemployment rising or falling?
There can be only one conclusion.
This is true of the Services Directive.
It is a genuine, widespread problem.
Allow me to give two examples.
Is that sensible?
That really is idiotic.
This cannot be the way to do things.
Protectionism does not create jobs.
Why?
We really must trust one another.
I am a big fan of the Commission.
I always support it.
Please let that be the last time!
I believe we will move forward.
We need this directive.
Those are essential.
We see it as a case of old versus new.
It is not.
We must continue along this route.

This was not an easy decision.
Europe needs economic growth.
So, what more do people want?
This is by no means progress!
It is not what Europeans expect.
That has been the real conflict.
We have a reasonable compromise.
I say ‚Äòlet‚Äôs go for it‚Äô.
I admit that I was a dreamer.
Why should they?
I bet you will not succeed.
This directive can contribute to that.
I am the third to last speaker.
¬†¬† .
I welcome that.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
I do not think so.
Why should politicians obstruct this?
Let us give entrepreneurs a chance.
We have an opportunity to do good.
We must not waste it.
Let us choose real freedom.

¬†¬† .
However, more aid will not be enough.
Which proposals can go forward fastest?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner.
It deserves our full support.
You did not even take it up.
The debate is closed.

This issue raises wider themes.
We must safeguard these principles.
Freedom of speech cuts both ways.
Violence is the enemy of dialogue.
This, too, must be made quite clear.
Allow me to make one personal remark.
I did not receive an answer.
That is the way things have to be.
We must now look forward.
That gives us a special responsibility.
¬†¬† . ‚Äì Good morning, little EU!
Globalisation has indeed arrived.
Several people have been killed.
Indeed, globalisation has arrived.
We all need to open our minds.
There is no easy one-way ticket back.
We have no other globe available yet.
How can Europe respond?
Freedom can never be given away.

We must show solidarity on this.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
We should support this proposal.
The stakes are extraordinarily high.
How should Europe respond to this?
I do not believe that it will.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

We fear the person in possession.
So let us look at the facts.
What are the facts?
No¬†one ever got hurt from di-a-logue!
This is essential to our credibility.

The Persians are not Arabs.
This is where the greatest danger lies.
We hope that it succeeds in doing so.
There is also the human-rights issue.
¬†¬† .
What are the options for the future?
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
So what is the prognosis now?

¬†¬† .
So I hope we will be finished by 4 p.m.
¬†¬† .
This is a good thing.
That is not the solution.
A lot has been said here about Islam.
That is all tied up with Bosnia.
I am quite certain of this.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What more can we do?

What will happen next?
That was known as liberalisation.
¬†¬† .
It is an impoverished country.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you, Mr President.
This is a most deplorable act.
I regret that it did not do so.
¬†¬† .
It is therefore a Europe-wide project.
The debate is closed.
It is EP¬†United 1, Racism 0.
I thank all Members who have signed.
This is a historic moment.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
¬†¬† .
I think we can all agree on that.
Your view is absolutely right.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Those discussions are ongoing.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you for the question.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is crucial.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
All these things matter.
I very much appreciate your support.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is up to all of us to do that.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is the intention for the future.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is very important.
¬†¬† .
It is possible within a Member State.
¬†¬† .
I am now following that very closely.
¬†¬† .
That concludes Question Time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Europe has a duty to encourage this.
That really has to be the way forward.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Non-private forests also need support.
My sincere thanks go to him for that.
This is quite right.

Around 60% of forests are private.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Benefits will flow from that.
That is robbing Peter to pay Paul.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I support the report of Mrs McGuinnes.
¬†¬† .
My sincere thanks go to her for that.
We must therefore coordinate these.
This is all very well.


This is a good report.
This is the way forward.

Today that is no longer enough.
I thank the rapporteur for her work.
¬†¬† .
That is acceptable.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Why is this item not on the agenda?
All this is nothing new.
I feel that this is essential.
This is an extremely serious issue.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Harbour.

That is not sufficient, however.
There is absolutely no security there.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr Chruszcz.
That concludes this item.
¬†¬† .
None of them has ratified it yet.
¬†¬† .
That is quite splendid.
Absolutely not.
Women are not a commodity.
They are not for sale.
¬†¬† .
In-depth checks are necessary.



Thank you.
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner.
¬†¬† .
That is why close monitoring is needed.
That is indeed good news.
It was the first of its kind.
Do we really want to fight trafficking?
There is a way.
Are we brave enough?
¬†¬† .
Legal restrictions are needed.
The fate of the rapist is unknown.
Let us talk about how to do that.

Thank you in advance.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
My congratulations to the rapporteur.
Five years is far too short a period.
¬†¬† .
‚Äì The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Firstly, the question of rights.
Lastly, the question of management.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.

¬†¬† .

We must learn from them.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .




¬†¬† That concludes this item.
But who should lead this change?
It creates most jobs in industry.
To all of them I express my thanks.
¬†¬† .

Women need decisive action.
Let me mention a few of them.
Some of you also mentioned roaming.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
We must take action urgently.
Society changes, moves on, modernises.
We refuse to accept this prospect.
The way he did this was excellent.
That development will continue.
There will be no alternative.
Secondly, there must be participation.
Thirdly, experiences must be shared.
¬†¬† .
A tailored response really is needed.
So, how did we do it?
How did we restructure?
Nor were EU funds involved.
That is the truth.
How are they supposed to restructure?
So what are we to do there?
What shall we do?
How can we help?
This is the reality.
Nothing is working today.
What are we to do there?
Let us make a new army of .
That is the problem.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.

¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
There is no hierarchy of oppression.
Why do we need one?

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
So be it.
That is contrary to fact.
I would like to point to four of them.
That is not the case.
They do not need an institute.
¬†¬† .
I fully support this argument.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
Approximately 30% of MEPs are women.
Thank you for the floor!
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.

What do we say to that?
Europe must regain its fitness.

¬†¬† Thank you, Mr President.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes voting time.
We are all agreed on this.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† . This is an excellent report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our abstention.
¬†¬† .
Our proposals were as follows.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .I voted in favour of this text.
Common sense has prevailed here.
This mistake cannot be repeated.
It is a relatively small percentage.
Let me address this briefly.
¬†¬† .
Why have they had the need?
Could you answer that?
You say not.
However, I still feel concerned.
People see us as being protectionist.
¬†¬† .
This is clearly not the case here.
Do you recognise that?
¬†¬† .
This is a serious concern.
We are behind you.
What lies behind this dumping?
That is part of the reason.
Here too, we must be consistent.
They are very different cases.
Far from it.
Let us put this case into perspective.
This sampling takes time.
I do not understand this.
We cannot and will not do that.
It is important to do that.
Let me add this related comment.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Once again, we must report that:
¬†¬† .
This change has been radical.
I believe that more is needed.
¬†¬† .
That, too, must be our common concern.
¬†¬† .
Congratulations Mrs Hazan.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I had the honour to do so in 2001.
I have two questions today.
The first is to the Council.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Someone should tell Mrs¬†Wallstr√∂m ...
I refer to the European Arrest Warrant.
Clearly, a change is required.
¬†¬† .
I will discuss the question later on.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Nothing has happened.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì Absolutely.
That is one very important aspect.
That is a crucial aspect.
That is another crucial aspect.
All power to your elbow!
We were told to table questions to her.
We had to wait until March.
From acorns grow oak trees.
Mr Newton Dunn made that point.
We have waited for three months.
The Minister has been very gracious.
I have never seen that happen before.
This one simply does not work.
We actually had the same objective.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I can only speak as an economist.
We do not intervene in those policies.
Are there signs of any change?
Are these fears justified?
They are asked for more and more.
That sort of thing should not happen.
Visibly they are quite different.
So the risks are limited.
This will be negotiated.
Why Laeken?
That is the picture today.
¬†¬† .
That is the process.
¬†¬† .
Of course, the key is implementation.
We have huge concerns about that.
I believe that is crucial.
How long does it take in this field?
That is a very relative concept.
That concludes Question Time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Why should this be so?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Poverty naturally breeds poverty.
¬†¬† .
The opposite is the case.
I propose that the report be accepted.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Section I ‚Äì European Parliament
Section II ‚Äì Council
Section IV ‚Äì Court of Justice
Section V ‚Äì Court of Auditors
Section VIII(A) ‚Äì European Ombudsman
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is conditional on several factors.
I am firmly in support of that idea.
¬†¬† .
This in itself is a very good thing.
¬†¬† .
Let us have an end to this.
I am saying this as a pro-European.
I support Mr¬†Grech‚Äôs request.
This is a genuine request.
However, there is a downside.
Well, that is my wish list.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
¬†¬† .
I am very much obliged to you all.
That is wrong and we should change it.
¬†¬† .
My warmest thanks go to them for that.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It was becoming urgent to reform it.
The same applies to public procurement.

¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
This is an urgent matter.
¬†¬† .
The report is very timely.
Fifthly, seas know no borders.
We need to look at where we are going.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Some of them have asked to do so.
¬†¬† .
That is our heartfelt wish.
¬†¬† .
That must be our aim.
Who benefits from what happened?
However, I do have three questions.
Why was it not used?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The Israeli action was outrageous.
That is also the truth.
Can we accept that?
It really is hard to credit.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
No, we must not.
Nevertheless, they were free and fair.
It was their duty to deal with it.
They did not: they walked away.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The same applies to the committees.
This wastes EUR¬†12¬†million a year.
¬†¬† .
The necessary instruments are in place.
I would be grateful.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† No, Mr President.
That is good news.
Let us move up a gear.
Let us be clear.
Let us be clear.
We must achieve better integration.
We must stay there.
However, our systems are fragmented.
They do not appear to be connected.
It is an ambitious project.
¬†¬† .
We need to bear that in mind.
You referred to GALILEO and Airbus.
I apologise for this interruption.
¬†¬† .
That is the situation after six years!
You cannot even build a shack.
Welcome to the valley, Mr¬†President!
The downhill race is now over.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Why do I say that?
No, it is expensive.
Why, for heaven‚Äôs sake?
That is the choice facing us.
What do we want?
A political union is our primary goal.
That is not what we want.
The EU is an opportunity.
And what are we to think of Skoda?
Firstly, the free movement of workers.
I turn now to my second example.
Now for my third example.
Our problem is what happens at the end.
In fact, it is somewhat bogged down.

That is the fundamental problem.
But what about wage rises?
Wages are staying where they were!
That is what we need!

It is an opportunity for us all.
We know what we have to do.
It is time for action.
I shall focus upon that.
We need more growth.
That is how development proceeds.
That is how development proceeds.
Is that possible?
No, it is not.
We propose measures in three areas.
We have made progress, but not enough.
We need proactive labour markets.
Deliver, do not talk!
Reforms are necessary, though.
There is work to be done.
That too is not a threat.
That has happened now.
There is no time to waste.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you very much.
We shall look into it.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is voting time.
‚ÄìThat concludes voting time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We say no to all forms of prostitution.
¬†¬† .
I am therefore voting in favour of it.
We have thus voted against this report.
¬†¬† .
I am voting for the Grech report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.

¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
These are very wise words.

¬†¬† .
That is the problem!
That is disappointing.
Allow me to comment on the Middle East.
What are the real questions?
We must take on our responsibilities.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
Thirdly, we need better communication.
¬†¬† .
It would be an historic mistake.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It has set far-reaching goals.
This begs the question: why?
If it enjoys stability, then so do we.

That is the question.
Who decides who will join Europe?
Until recently we said no to Croatia.
Is this the political will of Europe?
These are not logical formulations.
Why do you not call a spade a spade?
We have to be prepared for enlargement.
The truth is that they want money.
They want yet more money.
Well done, Mr Kuhne!






Where, then, do we stand now?
What are we working on?
We did this in our troika meeting.
Let me say something about Ukraine.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Take the energy sector as an example.
This scenario is bad for consumers.
I consider that inappropriate.
A dream scenario or a nightmare?
The first is industrial policy.
¬†¬† .
Of course there are asymmetries!
The present discussion is astonishing.
Does it enhance competition?
That is what was decided.
That is basic.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
That is another very important issue.
No donor has done more to help them.
That is my intention.
¬†¬† .
He now plans to stage a hunger strike.
¬†¬† .
I would like to put that question.
This is a live and developing process.
Today we have one.
Commissioner, we have listened to you.
We Europeans have also been snubbed.
That has been the effect of Jericho.
The future scenario concerns us.
That cannot be done overnight.
That is what we want.
I believe Barcelona was a success.
The content was good.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Venezuela, Iran und Belarus abstained.
We have a Human Rights Council!
1.
2.
3.
The council should not be too big.
4.
5.
6.
7.
The need for a continued role for NGOs.
8.
We do support the UN in this work.
This is a large step forward.
Not everything is perfect, of course.
I have no need to go on.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
These are five important successes.
That is their contribution.
That is part of today‚Äôs agreement.
I wonder whether the US will stand.
The EU must play a key role in this.
That is open to debate.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
The matter has to be debated first.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We should be clear on this matter.
According to ...
Quality has its price.
This had previously been impossible.
In all honesty, I do not believe so.
I would urge them to do so.
It is a Codex standard.
So eat more Edam from North Holland!
However, we have to be very prudent.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
¬†¬† .
He presented his views quite clearly.
¬†¬† .
We must support small legal practices.
Do not make any mistakes.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What does that mean?
That is what really makes sense.
That is surely a great advantage.
Finally, a word on quality.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Such strategy is no longer suitable.
Today is World Consumer Rights Day.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
¬†¬† Many thanks.
Your comments have been noted.
¬†¬† Many thanks.
Your comments have been noted.
¬†¬† Many thanks.
Your comments will be noted.
¬†¬† Thank you very much.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Better use can be made of resources.
¬†¬† .
But the budget is a concern.
¬†¬† .
So, it is over to the Commission.
¬†¬† .
There is a good reason for that.
¬†¬† .
That is not what we want.
What else are they to get?
We do not want that!
That cannot be allowed to continue.
Cardiac diseases: first cause of death.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
No one country can tackle this alone.
Why can we not learn from each other?
Attention should go to that area too.
We should call a spade a spade.
Thank you, Mr¬†President.
My group will support Amendment¬†64.
It is vital that we close that gap.
The focus is quite clear.
Combine prevention and treatment.
I wish to emphasise two priorities.
We have to help the weakest.
I think not quite enough.
We are faced with new challenges.
Diseases do not stop at borders.
Knowledge is certainly another factor.
¬†¬† .
I will make a few brief comments.
That is an important issue.
There is no question about that.
Patient mobility is an important issue.
We are promoting that area as well.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I think we should really stick to it.
1.
2.
That is my suggestion as rapporteur.
We shall now hear from the draftsmen.
His speaking time is three minutes.
I feel a bit like that right now!
I should like to make three points.
We are one big family.
Let us stick to that basic line.
Seventeen names now follow.
They are the following persons:
Siarhiej Malƒçyk
Viktar Sazonau
Vadzim Saranƒçukou
Andrej Pisalnik
Miko≈Ça Lemianouski
Alaksiej Trubkin
Siar≈æuk Hudzilin
Jauhien Vaukauviec
Ale≈õ ƒåyrejka
Vital Brouka
Vasil Leuƒçanka
Tatsiana Klimoviƒç
Dzimitry ≈†ymanski
Ryhor Bakijeviƒç
Anatol Labied≈∫ka
Siarhiej Niarouny
Vincuk Viaƒçorka
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.
¬†¬† .
Rule 151(3) states:
This is pure nonsense.
¬†¬† .
It has been dealt with.
¬†¬† That concludes voting time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .I voted in favour of this text.
This poses a real threat.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is not the case.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It was an historic event.
That is something I shall vote against.
The borders cannot be closed.
That would be an historic setback.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

The terms of the debate are familiar.
However, that is the way it is.
¬†¬† .
The problem lies elsewhere, however.
Society feels threatened by GMOs.
¬†¬† .
I understand Parliament‚Äôs position.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is not an ethnic conflict.
Surprise, surprise!
That is when the joke turns sour.
However, this is the way forward.
You know that is the case.
That was completely misinterpreted.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5 p.m.
It cannot be controlled or partial.
¬†¬† .

One thing is for sure.
¬†¬† Mr President, just a brief word.

Thank you.
A climate of fear also prevails.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is a good step.
Some of you have alluded to that.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5 p.m.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The many victims demand it.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That also has to be said.
¬†¬† .
This is a good step forward.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† .
Mr President, I have an oral amendment.
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

The process is possible.
This is progress.
That was a mistake.
I have nearly finished.
We are now collecting 37¬†signatures.
That is always good for Parliament.
(1)
¬†¬† .
Admittedly, our task is not complete.
So, what about 2007?
So what are the next steps?
¬†¬† .
What does that mean?
Energy is the fundamental issue.
That is what I want to speak about.
A revised Lisbon Strategy?
Of course!
Fine!
A key challenge!
Unity throughout the House!
Agreed!
Agreed!
Wonderful!
Great!
That is certain!
I expect the Commission to do that.
¬†¬† .
Fine words from such faint hearts!
Europe deserves better.
Thirdly, there is the issue of energy.
No, it has not.
¬†¬† .
Let us see what is behind the advice.
Tell us how you use taxpayers‚Äô money.
Show some confidence in people.
Let us have a look at them, one by one.
It is much the same with education.
I fully support you on that.
There are no clues.
Perhaps it is now time for Plan B.
What does this mean?
It means increased unemployment.
It means increased redundancies.
It therefore means a worse life.
It means increased prices.
I mean the very big thing.
Look across the wide ocean!
¬†¬† .
I am sorry, but this is not true.
Let no one be in any doubt about this.
They are agreements .
Let us be frank.
I want to be clear about this.
However, that is the small print.
Montesquieu has been quoted.
Let me give you a simple example.
But all work is duplicated.
I think this strategy is quite good.
¬†¬† .
Perhaps we can make some progress.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
This is absolutely essential.
It comes at a good time.
¬†¬† .
All three should interact.
¬†¬† .
We want growth and employment.
¬†¬† .
We are not using existing technology.
¬†¬† .
Will they discuss energy?
No, that is not the question!
¬†¬† .
How many are there, and which are they?
Energy is essential to every country.
We should not mix them up.
By how much?
It is inadequate.
Nothing is achieved this way.
How should this be achieved?
We have long experience in this area.
I wholeheartedly agree with that.
The same applies to energy.
I have no major reservations with that.
It needs a lot of work by Parliament.
The resolution omits this.
Who would suffer?
Germany?
Commissioners of the split Union?
I think three things are decisive.
Enough of asymmetry, enough of rogues.
Will we be able to do this?

¬†¬† .
That much we can already say.
¬†¬† .
We face as big a challenge as he did.
However, we should also have courage.
This is the key to success.
This is crucial.
Solidarity is extremely important.
We must help ourselves.
Thank you very much for your debate.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .

But they should be available.
What should our answer be?
¬†¬† .
We remain to be convinced.
These elections are a moment of hope.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
These are not unimportant caveats.
Time is of the essence.
That surely cannot be in our interest.
¬†¬† .
Promises were in fact made in 2005.
What sort of partnership is this?
That requires very careful examination.
The debate is closed.
It is an enormous waste of human life.
He is still there today.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.


In conclusion, then, I thank you.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Why, I would like to know?
I regard that as pure cynicism.
A few priorities must be stated.
There is no diktat in that.
We work in tandem, therefore.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Our young people represent our future.
¬†¬† .
We fully share this view.

This of course is not the case.
They are right: there is not one.
That is indefensible.
Do not kid yourselves!
That is the reality.
We have to do much more.
Why?
Why?

What is the cause of this erosion?
The challenge is clear for all to see.
This is a very important debate.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We have come to a very critical stage.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.

¬†¬† .
This is a very good sign.
We owe this to our Belarusian partners.
¬†¬† .
That is the situation we are facing.
¬†¬† .
That is the truth of the matter.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you Madam President.
For us this will be unacceptable.
Nobody is deluding himself by anything.
We cannot come up with excuses.
Thank you.

I, as a Pole, know this only too well.
I took on the challenge.
We all agree on this.
That is exactly what we need now.
Smart sanctions have been mentioned.
That is indeed important.
We shall endeavour to do that.
We also have to support NGOs.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
This is an unquestionable success.

Immigration is only a partial solution.
¬†¬† .
The status quo is not an option.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I call for a change in priorities.
Thank you for your attention.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Countries then learn from each other.
There can be a lot of flexibility.
I think there is a big future for that.
This is a very great bonus.
This must be carefully monitored.
There are some inconsistencies here.
Yes, we do.
In other words, we will all be winners.
We still need more jobs in rural areas.
We have a lot of work ahead of us.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
Could you please slow down?
After
‚Äòmanagement expenditure for‚Äô
the following phrase:
The text would then read as follows:
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
¬†¬† .
Pensioners, take a stand!
I also think it is not necessary.
For what purpose though?
Long live pensioners!
Neither will be accepted in any case.
¬†¬† .
The world is growing older.
Hundreds of jobs will be lost.
Hence my abstention.
¬†¬† .
Thank you very much.
Can we vote on tendencies?
I shall pass it on.
The repression is extremely violent.

(1)
That will also be their fatal error.
Romano Prodi is our man there‚Äô.
It should be thoroughly investigated.
Is that your proposal?
It is about time we saw that happening.
Europe too is losing its food security.
That delays the debates.
¬†¬† .
That is not possible.
It is the border of Europe.
Malta must be a transit country.
I call on you all to support Malta.
¬†¬† .
Asylum seekers are not criminals.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I believe that that is truly excessive.
This, moreover, is the tragedy.
Mr¬†President, Parliament is speaking.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What do you think about this proposal?
Thank you.
¬†¬† .
So that is the main challenge.
We will provide it quickly.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is urgently needed as well.
This is not right.
I consider this wholly insufficient.
¬†¬† .
But there are two stages.
Then there is conformity.
So that is not the end of the story.
I know that the challenge is huge.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The Commissioner is doing a good job.
¬†¬† .
Why?
It is about two-way traffic.
He is indeed the advisor.
We will be looking at that.
It should be combated.
For that we need a united Europe.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
The reality is very different, however.
If not now, then when?
The ball is in the Council‚Äôs court.
Please open up your doors.
We Europeans want to participate.
¬†¬† .
We come from different traditions.
The arguments have been won.
Let us take on the anti-Europeans.
Let us promote our institutions.
Let us celebrate what we do.
They can and must be.

¬†¬† .
It does not have to be like that.
(No!)
Why is it delicate?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

Indeed, we agree with this.
Secondly, we have a right of oversight.
Our use of experts is a public matter.
A lot remains to be done in this area.
Where is the Council?
Why do they not open their doors?
But that is not enough.
Would you like it to be elected?
I am going to abandon Mr Knapman now.
I have run out of time.
I have several points.
My next point is about Coreper.
That debate should be in public.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
They are not.
That is a matter of common sense.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We are very competitive in this area.
¬†¬† .
The time has come to move ahead.

There is a gorgeous lake in Geneva.
¬†¬† .
Yet lessons were not learned.

¬†¬† .
It is quite astonishing.
I have several points.
I think it raises key issues.
Then there is agriculture.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
(1)
¬†¬† .
(2)
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
A final point.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Firstly, why a report?
What can we do in order to be heard?
The United States are ahead of us.
¬†¬† .
Of what has this updating consisted?
Three broad areas.

Childcare is one of the core issues.

¬†¬† .
We want Guideline No 22 to be deleted.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Well, let us do that.
Of course you will not.
You have been warned!
In Greece alone, we need one million.
Can we promise them?
We cannot promise them.
Europe cannot safeguard these jobs.
We have no energy of our own.
That is the reality.
Even they are Chinese.
Farmers are suffering.
I shall comment on just a few of them.


That, in fact, is what we all want.
Look at Amendment 2, for example.
Read our Amendment 5 as well.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
On the contrary!
¬†¬† .
What is this fear about?
What should the answer be?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What do we find?
You were right.
The opposite is actually the case.
Economic migration is restricted.
That has indeed, already happened.
Where is the justice in that?
Such cases are quite unacceptable.
We need to encourage them to do that.
We must combat this strongly.


That was shown to be absurd.
Is that not protectionism?
With a great deal of difficulty.
We have no minimum wage in Denmark.
That, moreover, is the way things are.
Allow me to reiterate.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is voting time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì That concludes voting time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We therefore voted against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Take the example of services.
¬†¬† .
I voted for a similar amendment today.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We know that a balance can be struck.
¬†¬† .
What a shame!
Sometimes, we opt for the latter.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I am fully in support of that.
It was a compromise.
If you read it, it certainly is not.
I have a few questions and comments.
What do you mean?
Is it a directive?
I have a question, though.
Nothing has changed.
¬†¬† .
It is a good proposal.
¬†¬† .
Silence is equivalent to assent.
The debate is closed.
You know it all went horribly wrong.
How can we achieve this?
Some are good, and some are not.
That is what is missing.
¬†¬† .
That is not the right way forward.
Let me give you an example.
I will start with simplification.
¬†¬† .
How do we perceive this challenge?
Let us look at impact assessment.
I believe it is real progress.
We know there is room for improvement.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
He should add terrorism to that list.
Law is, as it were, our main product.
This is really welcome.
That, however, is an obvious message.

I will just read you the language.
There are many more examples.
Who is mistaken?
Perhaps nobody is?
What is it all about?
Next, it passes to the Council.
What is to be done then?
This is a serious political challenge.
That is not what this is about.
We need to know what we are doing.
That is why we had to do something.
Let us not fool ourselves, however.
It will always be a matter of judgment.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The levels of risk should be assessed.
¬†¬† .
The procedures must be followed.
We have to live by what is there.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† . It is a very difficult question.
That is my understanding.
¬†¬† .
Are these statements accurate?
That is the situation.


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

We have discussed this issue.
¬†¬† .
This is also a very important Action.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Will it really make a difference?
¬†¬† .
Of course they are not.
It is still not too late.
European integration policy is failing.
I would have gone much further.
There cannot be any other criteria.
It was also European.
¬†¬† .
The Takkula report is good.
Crimes are and remain crimes.
¬†¬† .
One, two, three.
What did you hear?
Absolutely nothing!
Are there demands to do something?
No!
No, again.
So here we go again!
This is pay-as-you-go citizenship.
The price rises as your rights go.
Why?
Malta is a beautiful island.

The committee decided against it.

Congratulations on your good work.
Stalinism‚Äôs twin brother was Nazism.
I condemn all forms of totalitarianism.
I support every bit of it.
¬†¬† .
The last point concerns the title.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
How do the cities reflect it?
I think this is something we all do.
As you can see, Italians are operative.
I do not have time to go into detail.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The list is very long.
They also have very long half-lives.
Others would cite a much higher figure.
¬†¬† .
We have a result we can be proud of.
¬†¬† .
We have still not received a response.
I call on you to rectify this error.
There are no reassuring signals.
Alternatives do exist.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The Council will be here tomorrow.
The Commissioner may respond today.
¬†¬† .
You can be confident that we mean it.
That is all I can say at the moment.
¬†¬† .
Is that true?
¬†¬† .
I know of no differences.
We will continue in accordance with it.
I do not know about them.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.

¬†¬† .
That has now been achieved.
I know it was difficult.
We have no more time to lose.

¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The figures speak for themselves.
¬†¬† .
Nobody sensible would indulge in it.
Everything is done to avoid spending!
That concludes this item.
¬†¬† .


That brings me to the budget.
¬†¬† .
We now have monitoring mechanisms.
We have 25 national reform programmes.
We can win the globalisation battle.
We will take this work forward swiftly.
Good.
We are putting words into action.
That is our duty.
We should do more to achieve it.
That is our shared responsibility.



That is a good sign.
You need three Councils a year.
What, then, is happening today?
I am grateful for your support.
That is quite crucial.
Just take a look at the results.
That did not happen, however.
Why is that?
Much more must be done, however.
Good luck!

Let us face facts, however.
Thank you very much.
But what happened?
I agree.
How can such decisions be justified?
¬†¬† .
These points were positive.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† We shall proceed to the vote.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is what I did.
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
Thank you for being here with us.
You have the floor.
Let us not waste it.
Let me cite a few examples:
Naturally, size also matters.
We need to adopt a holistic attitude.
Here, too, a balance has to be found.
Thank you.
¬†¬† .
This is a gross waste of public funds.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you, Mr President.
There was a misunderstanding yesterday.
Thank you.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our decision to abstain.
¬†¬† .
I welcome these positive benefits.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Why rigour?
That will take some time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Let us seize this opportunity.
So, the situation looks pretty bleak.
We send our best wishes to both sides.
¬†¬† .
It is the same water.
Who wins?
No one!
It is not possible.
Not even Israel can do that.
¬†¬† .
This policy is irresponsible.
East Jerusalem is surrounded!
¬†¬† .
We therefore need a long-term strategy.
¬†¬† .
We are working on this.
He is the interlocutor at present.
New people have appeared as leaders.
What does that mean?
Now, does it open possibilities?
We have seen that already.
That is something really sad.
Mr Cohn-Bendit has changed.
I have changed.
In the future, yes, we can change.
That has to be reciprocal too.
This is not negotiation.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Sharon‚Äôs legacy contains three tasks:
¬†¬† .
The Council will continue to do this.
¬†¬† .
This is very important for the future.
We have made this known.
We must see what can be done.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Will a visa ban be imposed on them too?
Economic gain is thus the objective.
They must go on the list.
¬†¬† .
This is not the case at all.
I simply wish to make one point.
Additional charges have been imposed.
We need to go much further.
This House will help.
Who is Mr Lukashenko today?
All the world is to be warned about it.
Moreover, we should go further.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The media project was mentioned.
We will have to continue with that.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That pretty much covers everything.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We can rejoice in a job well done.
What of the future?
That must not be allowed to happen.
¬†¬† .
The question now arising is: what next?
What more can we do to help Ukraine?
¬†¬† .
We are ready to do so.
¬†¬† .
I cannot be any more precise.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
To save 25¬†000 lives!
What stage are we at with this?
Yes or no?
We believe they should be.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This strikes me as the key point.
While we wait, reality moves on.
That is what I want to comment about.
We are not talking only about aviation.
But that would be the wrong approach.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
After all, this is not a new problem.
¬†¬† .
Yes!
¬†¬† .
You mentioned the re-education camps.
¬†¬† I thank the President-in-Office.
You ask what more we can do.
¬†¬† .
I think we are on the right track.
We are making progress.
¬†¬† .
The regulations are clear.
The Council has no powers here.
¬†¬† .
I am not a philosopher, I am a lawyer.
¬†¬† .
Will we give it an escape route?
¬†¬† .
There is not always unanimity there.
Have you replied clearly?
¬†¬† .
These obligations must be satisfied.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is the answer we need.
¬†¬† .
You mentioned the Supreme Court.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
At the moment it is not.
How will it be financed?
There is no other way.
Something has to be done about this.
There are 700 of us.
¬†¬† I am really sorry.
That concludes Question Time.
¬†¬† .
The causes of this crisis are complex.
And why is it our fault?
Europe has 15 times higher a ratio.
Put your money where your mouth is.
Make poverty history!
¬†¬† .
The result is devastating.
¬†¬† .
Their first need is to be safe.
They leave in frustration.
We must address this problem urgently.
This brings me to my last point.


The reverse is true.
Who is bearing the brunt of this?
But not all is bleak.
And the long list could be continued.
I would like to talk about the Roma.
I was in Malawi last year.
We must not do nothing.
I hope we achieve this.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
That is why we are here tonight.
We have already acted.
There is no time to waste.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Practice has varied to date.
We need to be consistent.
I sympathise with the Commission.
It is an extremely difficult balance.
Swift and decisive action is needed.
There is not enough money?
What action, though, can it take?
We have an excellent Commissioner.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
The EDF surplus also poses a problem.
What does the future hold for the EDF?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
In that we cannot invest enough.
I find that rather odd.
How can that be sensible?
We have work in progress.
¬†¬† .
We have had this discussion before.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
That state of affairs must change.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We also need to deregulate.
Regulation is the mother of corruption.
We are on the right track.
¬†¬† .
Not very, I am afraid.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
There is a need for more transparency.
We also have to examine ourselves.
We cannot just blame African people.
That is the one message.
Sometimes parliaments are the problem.
I accept that.
We can encourage that.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
A very warm welcome to you!
We wish you all the best at home.
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Human rights should not be infringed.
Parliament took no stand on that.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I will vote for this resolution.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We are closely following the situation.
Three civilians were killed.
The PKK is a terrorist organisation.
¬†¬† .
There can never be an excuse.
That is the only solution.
¬†¬† .
There must be no more of them.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


The PKK needs to do the same.
It needs to evolve‚Äô.
Turkey has chosen its prospects.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
It is not.
The violence has to stop.
What is it that is happening there?
How does that feel?
So what is the government doing?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is what it amounts to.
How many more conflicts do we need?
And now Darfur is far too far away.
¬†¬† .
Let us call a spade a spade.

The United Nations cannot do anything.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
What can we do?
I urge you to support this resolution.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I support the resolution.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.

He tries to give Egyptian people hope.
Egyptian people deserve democracy.
Why is Ayman¬†Nour in prison?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is Voting Time.
That concludes Voting Time.
¬†¬† Does anybody else wish to speak?
Are there any comments?
That is the simple way I see things.
We shall see¬†...

That argument seems unanswerable to me.
The majority will decide.
That is democracy, thank you.
¬†¬† .

There is another reason.
The risk of that is too great.
First of all, we need more dignity.
The victims deserve dignity.
Societies must learn.
Now is the time for decision.
¬†¬† .
Nuclear power is not safe.
Aged reactors are dangerous reactors.
The fuel will run out one day.
People are still dying.
What conclusion do we need to draw?
We must call for nuclear disarmament.
Do you know why?
Democracy needs courage.
¬†¬† .
I shall end with this short quote.
I was two months pregnant 20 years ago.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Those are the questions that arise.


Thank you for your attention.
What do we think?
¬†¬† .

That is not what this is about at all.


This is not a European Union any more.
It is bad for us. It is bad for them.
They are not perfect in all aspects.
That is very important.
There are new laws in place.
What is happening to them?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Let me go through them again.
¬†¬† .
This is just not true.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Mine is no exception.
If we do not, others will.
What should we be asking?
Have any of you spoken to Hamas?
No one has tried to talk to Hamas!
¬†¬† .


That is very serious.
What kind of game are we playing, then?
I welcome this stance.

How does the state of Israel see this?
We have to try to find another tool.
Where are we now?
However, the difficult task now begins.
We are at a crossroads.
¬†¬† .
That is what we are doing.
We will certainly continue to do so.
¬†¬† .
We have been very clear on that.
Are we applying double standards?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .



¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Chile has its first woman president.
Such a partnership must be a broad one.
¬†¬† .
That is the direction we must take.
The rest is just pretty words.
Some of us are more honest.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
This is important for our future work.
¬†¬† .
Each country has different rules.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
This is hypocrisy in its saddest form.
Except that this is no longer true.
Thank you for your words of solidarity.
This is happening as we speak.
And this, too, is now a current issue.
Is this really helping democracy?
This is a very serious matter.
Let us put our own house in order.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
It is now 7.45¬†p.m.
I will return to this in a moment.
¬†¬† .
The instinct is to cover things up.
That is a deeply undemocratic attitude.
I did not find out why.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
Thank you for your attention.
This is overdue.
That, too, must change in future.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Mr President, I have three points.
It is going to go on all evening.
I have four points on that.
Let us look at what really happened.
Thirdly, we need more information.
Praise is obviously in order.
This is elementary economic logic.
¬†¬† .
He has produced a sterling report.
¬†¬† .
This situation is intolerable.
The system should be abolished.
We must ensure that this is done.
No, of course it is not.
And here?
This is totally unacceptable.
It is only right.
It is very clear what they are saying.
We are the Budgetary Control Committee!
Now is the time to bring it to an end.
Why is this debate being held at night?
Paris protects it.
Why?
This debate is very important.



So what now?
That brings in several million euros.
Yes or no?
Yes or no?
We can be modestly optimistic about it.
Thank you very much for your comments.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
This has served us well to date.
This is serious and promising work.
This leads us to the disclosure area.
How do we move on from here?
Which brings me to a crucial point.


¬†¬† .
This work will have a dual focus.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .

However, there is a background to this.
That is of paramount importance.
¬†¬† .
Is there not something wrong here?
I have taken careful note of that.
State aid is far down the list.
We want real arguments and not bluff.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mrs Frassoni.
¬†¬† .
However, there is no common platform.
Therefore, it is a great idea.
What is needed?
We need the PSAPs to be upgraded.
¬†¬† .
We have not got that far yet.
I ask the House to adopt the report.

We have witnessed that today.
¬†¬† .
However, I am against it.
All this rings alarm bells for me.
¬†¬† .
We are elected legislators.

This is our primary objective.
This is investment, rather than a cost.
¬†¬† .
Therefore, things are moving.
- The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
There are no short cuts.
Many of them are now very hard pressed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Which languages are most spoken?
Is multilingualism on the increase?
Is that really what we want?
We live in a very fast-moving world.
It is inevitable.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
Thank you for your attention.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is Voting Time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We now face a similar issue.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
‚Äì That concludes Voting Time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
More than anything, the timing is poor.
Now is the time to stand firm.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
The June List objects to this proposal.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore support this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is a for granting discharge.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That, to my mind, is only fair.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We therefore voted against.
¬†¬† .
All of which in the name of innovation!
We therefore voted against.
¬†¬† .
I therefore could not support it.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
That is wrong.
A decision must be made.
I find that, if¬†‚Ä¶
Please sit down and wait.
Mr¬†Lehne, you have already spoken.
(1)



Thank you once again, Mr President.
You have the floor.
My parents had no documentation.
We are talking about the 19th century.
That will be our responsibility.

We no longer want to be a beggar State.
We want to put an end to that.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Do we agree with that?
Do we agree with this?
The Black Sea turned red.
His passing away is a great loss.
There were political orders, however.
Is this surprising?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
What happened before they did so?
¬†¬† .
I would like to make three points.
¬†¬† .
There was a certain balance.
¬†¬† .

It does not seem enough.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is a fact.
¬†¬† .
Those are the facts of the matter.
So do you eat dry cornflakes all day?
I do not.
¬†¬† .
Deception comes in many guises.
They are used in the United States.
These are now in place.
Thank you for your attention.
¬†¬† .
Does it meet the original aims?
We believe it does.
This is a good result.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It was an extremely arduous task.
Immediate action must be taken.
The solution is much more complex.
It is neither a vitamin nor a mineral.
In food and water it is a curse.


People are fat and people are inactive.
It is a proposal based on logic.
It is simple.
We talk about consumer choice.
It is impossible!
What will be the result?
That is a very important factor.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
This is a trade issue.
¬†¬† .

Mr Allister raised the question of .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Thank you for your attention.






Please take heed of that.
That period should be in the past.
Do read SHERPA‚Äôs legal analysis.


The debate is closed.
This is no surprise to most of us.
What do we propose?
We welcome the new ratifications.
We stand with Parliament on this.
Many ideas are being discussed.
Plan D was not a one-off operation.
¬†¬† .

No one ratifies something that is dead.
¬†¬† .
That is a clear message.
It is all in the Constitution, though.
How can it be possible now?
That is why we need the Constitution.
¬†¬† .
This really is a matter of urgency.
We must stop lying to ourselves.
Nothing will happen for years.
Nice?
Oh, it was not as bad as all that!
Parliament has adopted a decision.
With no capacity to take action?
You say he is listening to the people.
And what is Mr¬†Barroso doing?
Did he not listen?
They did not mention terrorism.
¬†¬† .
Shame on all of you!
We need reform.
That really is worthy of criticism.
That, too, has barely been mentioned.
I now come to my main problem.
None of this is in the papers, though.
What is missing is leadership.
¬†¬† Mr President, I have three points.
My final point concerns the blame game.
In communication, less is often more.
I have a few observations to make.
What Europe?
None of us.
We must counter that.
We need at least another year.
We need wider and deeper reflection.
We will have to address this issue.
That is simply not true.
That is going on.
The new ‚Äòplan D‚Äô ought to do both.
What is its objective?
What is its purpose?
Let us be realistic.
¬†¬† .
I think that is still valid.
It is exactly the Commission‚Äôs line.
We have a plan.
That is what people expect from us.
We have to do both things.
That is what they expect from us.
The Constitution is not dead.
That was their purpose.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.


¬†¬† .


This is a huge figure.
¬†¬† . Mr¬†President, I will be brief.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† .
I wonder whether you can help me.
¬†¬† I am sorry, Mr¬†Bloom.
I got your name wrong.
I called you Mr¬†Berlato. I apologise.
We all take note of it, thank you.

You have the floor.
¬†¬† (1).

Thank you for listening to me.
¬†¬† Thank you very much Mr President.
¬†¬† We now resume the vote.
This is incorrect.
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† We have voted against this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.

I am delighted about the fact.
¬†¬† .
None of these assumptions is valid.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It must, then, be possible to say so.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The aim is truth in advertising.
¬†¬† .
This was 14 years ago now.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Sometimes less is more.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† I am abstaining from voting.
In short, it can do what it wishes.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Let us give credit where it is due.
¬†¬† .
Today, everything fits together.
Ten countries joined us on 1 May 2004.
These must be put right without delay.
There would have been outrage.
So, stand to your responsibilities.
You share responsibility for this!
It is too easy.
Nothing.
I am in favour of enlargement.
I am for enlarging Europe!
Why should they be made to pay?
Last week, I was in a Roma quarter.
What I saw there was unbelievable.
What has happened to the money?
Please do so.
It will be unable to reply to you.
No; the world has to change.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We all know what the basics are.


I still think it is wise.
It is a hugely exciting moment.
Inevitably, there are problems.
That constitutes considerable progress.
The opposite is the case.
They stated: ‚ÄòBanning is banned‚Äô.
Robin Hood could not be killed.
They do not deserve that.
Let us be clear on this.
There has been progress since October.
That is vitally important.
That is also our group‚Äôs ambition.
That is beyond question.
We all know that.
Mr¬†Cohn-Bendit is right there.
Pierre Moscovici has said so.
No, that will not do.
Corruption ‚Äì universal.
Corrections must be possible.
I will give you one example of this.
Well, I am all for free trade.
The progress is therefore evident.
I am optimistic.
As a result, everything gets through.
Yet there is no scanner.
It has not been completed yet.
That is important.
That is what we are all looking for.
What do we expect?
A new State prosecutor in Bulgaria?
No.
How many cases do we need to raise?
How many decisions in court do we need?
I have a suggestion to make to you.
This report hardly mentions it.
These are unresolved matters.
So an unqualified thank you.

That is worth a huge compliment.
This is the Commission‚Äôs role.
Let me raise two specific issues.
Thank you very much.
I do not see any other solution.
¬†¬† .
I fully agree with that.
I agree.
That is what we need to focus on.
They have come a long way.
Of course there are shortcomings.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
I should like to explain why.
This is very important.
That was crucial.
That was a major achievement.
Can she give me those figures?
Here we are talking about Article 95.
We are very proud of that.
It is part of our negotiation strategy.
That is absolutely vital.
A reduction in fuels ...
So I would push you in that direction.
Is any thought being given to this?
¬†¬† .
In some States it is already.
¬†¬† . Of course.
That is no big surprise.
¬†¬† .
We hope she will be back with us soon.
It is a very welcome initiative.
I have to respect that.

¬†¬† .
What are the advantages I see?
All right, it is a compromise.
¬†¬† .
That really goes without saying.
¬†¬† .
Let me give you just two examples.
¬†¬† .
Thank you for your patience.
Is that what the public wants?
That is indeed controversial.
The deadlines are about to expire.
We are ten years down the road.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
This represents a challenge.
¬†¬† .
Let me turn to some of the issues.
That is where it should be.
I need to make another brief comment.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Those are the terms of the Treaty.
That was just an aside.
¬†¬† .
That was why we abstained in the vote.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
In the eurozone it rose to 2.9% of GDP.
I should like to discuss that briefly.
This, in my view, is a crucial message.
All the indicators point to that.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
I really do feel under threat.
Of that I am all in favour.
He was on foot outside the hotel.
Some deficits, though, still remain.
That was also very helpful.
There are also new elements.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
There is a need for sweeping reform.
Rather, it is the art of the possible.
Let me give an example.
I am fundamentally opposed to this.
We should keep that in mind.
So far everybody has gained from it.
Why not?
That, of course, is true.
I do not think so.
Our judgement is that it does not.
We are not without ideas.
All I can say to that is ‚Äòphooey‚Äô.
Words mean nothing.

That is madness.
In Latvia, 80% of EU aid goes to Riga.
The diagnosis is virtually unanimous.
This is the budget of hypocrisy.
I challenge anyone to understand that.
Have we learnt nothing?
Have they achieved this?
Today, this decision is in your hands.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Is it a good compromise?
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† .
It is an honour to have you here.
¬†¬† .
How can humanity be given meaning?
What sort of world are we fighting for?
We have good reason to be optimistic.
The challenges are before us.
The words are used to hide the meaning.
Life is hard in much of Europe today.
There is acute social insecurity.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That was worthwhile.

¬†¬† .
Hence our rejection.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
1.
2.
3.
4.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our decision to abstain.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I am thus voting against the proposal.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This year we are doing so.
It is the right choice.
We can do better.

Europe must practice what it preaches.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
So who is talking about human rights?
Who is talking about human rights?
Who is talking about human rights?
Who is talking about human rights?
Who is talking?
Who is talking?
¬†¬† .



The policy should be effective.
I hope we continue in this way.
Again, that is included in this report.
For this, I personally thank him.
This is not an abstraction.
Europe cannot be an end in itself.
I am aware that this is difficult.
Thank you, Mr President.
My thanks to the rapporteur.
¬†¬† .
My response to that too is yes.
Are we having an impact?
Let us work towards this!
Parliament can certainly count on me.
¬†¬† .
I fully agree with that.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
These points were accepted.
This position is shared by the Council.
We have said so on several occasions.
I know legal advice differs on this.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Codecision is not negotiable.
They need our continued support.
For that, we need a legal base.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you, Mr President.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The second point was more serious.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you very much.
What price external relations then?
We do not have a lot of time.
That is why codecision is so important.
We have to set policy.
There are lots of hints.
Thank you.

At any rate, there is no coordination.
¬†¬† .
We want to do that in all good faith.
¬†¬† .
It is unnecessarily complicated.
I could not agree more with Mr¬†Brok.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
16, 18, 27, 28, 61, 87, 104
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† . I disagree, Mr¬†Rack.
Nothing has been shelved.
¬†¬† .
That is difficult.
¬†¬† .
What is your view of the situation?

¬†¬† .



¬†¬† .
There are two ways of handling budgets.
That concludes Question Time.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
Thus the Treaty is a good solution.
There are also causes for concern.
¬†¬† .
There would be stability.
This is a very common technique.
What are these circumstances?
How short are your memories?
We heard this excuse before.
That being the case, why not say so?
Why keep it secret?
What priorities are we setting?
This provides an opportunity.
The debate is closed.
Are you prepared to begin, Mr¬†Elles?
¬†¬† .
We take a different view.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It has to be genuinely new money.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Our group supports this.
¬†¬† .
I rest my case.
Please, let us leave them as they are.
¬†¬† .
Is anyone against any of this? No.
Let me put forward some suggestions.
¬†¬† .
It is rather a conventional budget.

I would like to highlight three areas.
Congratulations!
It is now time to honour this.
This is as far as we will go.
I hope so, but I also doubt it.
¬†¬† That concludes this item.
¬†¬† .
Cities face a range of problems.
Thank you, Mrs¬†Krehl.
There can never be too much of that.
Is that really what we want?
Obviously not.
¬†¬† That concludes this item.
¬†¬† .
I am not sure.

The climate is changing.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


At least they have been heard.

¬†¬† Mr President, I am from Ireland.
I have no problem with that.
The Solidarity Fund is crucial.
These reports are well drafted.
¬†¬† .
We are tied to the funds available.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I support this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We therefore voted against the report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I completely agree with this.
¬†¬† .
I voted in favour of this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I welcome the Estrela report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Finally this has taken place.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
It certainly does not speak for them.
¬†¬† .
Both sides have violated the ceasefire.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What we have to do is continue talking.
Who should do the talking?
We have to bring peace to the island.
¬†¬† .
We should instead carry on talking.
Perhaps the next one will.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Only States can have that status.
They take part in the warning system.
Why is this so?
¬†¬† .
Taiwan deserves better.
I have three points to make.
¬†¬† .
That is the position the EU supports.

¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
This is something I refuse to accept.
The subject is closed.
The Union must continue to grow.
Both are necessary.
That is the fundamental question.
For we must face the facts.
Habits set in.
Wear and tear take their toll.
Unemployment remains high.
There is a simple reason for that.
Well, that is not the case.
I will let you guess.
They did not need time to reflect.
That was 52 years ago.
What is the big difference?
What is needed?
So let us be positive about Europe!
¬†¬† .
We now have 15 states.
They must have their reasons.
I am quite convinced of that.
I am absolutely convinced of that.
I think you are right, Mr¬†Verhofstadt.
Europe is lacking in courage.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
We cannot cleverly sidestep it.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr¬†Wurtz.
¬†¬† .
I am not sure.
It was clear last year!
What is it about you, Mr Verhofstadt?
¬†¬† Calm down, Mr¬†Schulz, calm down.
¬†¬† .
The discussion is now taking place.
As it happens, the opposite is true.
¬†¬† .
Turkey is of no consequence to them.
I can tell you, Mr¬†Farage
That is not how things work.
Who would have thought it?
Allow me to add just one proposal.
He does not hide his goal.
He does not deny the facts.
Take heart, Mr¬†Verhofstadt.
Put every document on the Internet.
The first aspect is the time factor.
We have no time to lose.
The Constitution is not dead!‚Äô.
Why do you not listen?
Stop digging!
Who is right?
We need to know.
I think that is a mistake.
I think that they can.
Reality is hard.
I am indebted to him for this.
Many Members also mentioned masochism.
Thank you for your attention.
We need more.


Let us start from there.
Yes we do, but not at all costs.
For what purpose?
It would lose its identity.
So let us not try to hide things.
Could he be more specific?
Finally, we must not isolate ourselves.
¬†¬† .
How was the matter to be presented?
That is what they had in mind.

In a word, unacceptable.
Where to now, Europe?
On that we are agreed.
¬†¬† .
Guant√°namo is in this category.


¬†¬† .
We will play no part in it.
¬†¬† .
What do you intend to do about it?
Will you make real demands?
What will we do about this now?
What should happen to those people?

Who knows?

¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
We already have a transatlantic market.
It exists.
What investments take place?
As can be seen, the figure is huge.
Yet that is not the case.
This provides you with a good example.
Go to MTU.
That is only one example, however.


That is also the way it should be.
Disputes are normal.
Many of them we cannot solve.
Let us live with the situation.
And that, in theory, is everything.
Thank you.
¬†¬† .
The first is energy.
The US is facing a similar problem.
The second issue is visas.
¬†¬† .
The warning bell is ringing on the DDA.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
These are more than mere figures.
We must not take it for granted.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We should reject both extremes.
The second topic is Iran.
We must remain firm in this matter.
Allow me to prove it to you.
That is our big mistake.
We want a relationship on equal terms.
We do not have our own policy.
We have American hegemony.
No.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the joint debate.
Let us fly the flag!
I wish that the opposite were true.
I think we shall do that.
¬†¬† That concludes the item.
There is no doubt on this score.
Our group rejected this position.
But the challenge is far from over.
But trade is not a magic bullet.
Free trade is not the same as .
These will form the engine of growth.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
However, this is the situation we have.
¬†¬† .
I wish her a speedy recovery.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Childhood is not static.
¬†¬† .
Innovation plays a key role here.
¬†¬† .
So what has changed?
And then we introduced a new principle.
But what is innovation?
Innovation is not invention.
We have wonderful ideas.
It could not have been more on time.
¬†¬† .
We in our group support this proposal.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It has the support of Parliament.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Unfortunately, this is not the case.
The situation could be restored.
It lists known truths.
¬†¬† .
Can the Treaty be modified?
Of course.
They are completely different things.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Hence our opposition to this report.
¬†¬† .
This seems somewhat frustrating.
Even half of that would be too much.‚Äô
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Comitology is a highly codified matter.
Thank you for your attention.
It is unnecessary to keep repeating it.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is our European point of view.
¬†¬† .
This is a crucial element.
Other sources should also be used.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.



I agree.
Expensive energy teaches you a lesson.
What does it teach you?
It teaches you to save energy.
A case in point is the Galileo project.
I cannot accept this argument.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
What is this directive all about?

That is intolerable.
I do not believe that we do.
I now propose to continue in English.
The Commission also approves this text.
I shall focus on three points.

What are we waiting for?
Women want to work.
Not at all.
Will the recast directive change this?
It remains to be seen.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Twelve people live in one room.
¬†¬† .
I propose the adoption of the report.
¬†¬† .
This is a bad thing.
The sun shines on everyone.
The air is for everyone.
Water is for everyone.
Reproductive rights is a key issue.
In this area, too, we need sanctions.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
We need education and employment.
We need small region development.
It is unbearable!
We at least owe them that.
What is causing this?
What can we do now about all this?
Everything still remains to be done.
Thank you in advance for your support.
¬†¬† .
Gender aspects are there.




¬†¬† .
I shall just deal with two points.
Could you trust her or not?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Are there any comments?
I ask you to stop doing this.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is Voting Time.
I hope that makes sense.
¬†¬† Mr President, this is very simple.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† It is very simple.
‚Äì That concludes Voting Time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We shall see how it is when we use it.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What are we talking about then?
What a disgrace!
¬†¬† .
Furthermore it has a twofold purpose:
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is what they would like.
We do not.



¬†¬† .
New partnership?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I am not against it in principle.
Before political integration?
We can only reject it.
Farewell Europe, hello World!
¬†¬† .
The first of these is loyalty.
¬†¬† .
That is obviously not the case.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr¬†Mart√≠nez.
That is just utter nonsense.
Surely that is what is required.
Is that so or is it not?
Anything else would be nonsensical.
We do not need a plenary session.
We absolutely have to make a statement.
I am very surprised at this change.
(1)
I want our Parliament to take it up.
What does Turkey have to show here?
Almost nothing.
For the rest it is a utopia.
What is the real situation though?
I call on you to play a leading role.
We must give the consumer the choice.
This happened in June 1956.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr¬†Corbett.
¬†¬† .
We are a solution-based committee.
I mention some key points in my report.
We cannot thank them enough.
¬†¬† .
That brings me to the second point.
This is important for transparency.
Let me just say one thing about that.
We have several examples of that.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We have to bring an end to this.
¬†¬† .
This is extremely important.
‚ÄòBrussels is too far from here!‚Äô
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, yes.
Congratulations Michael.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
The first is a matter of semantics.
However, we still just keep on going.
That is what we now have to focus on.
Regrettably there is no single number.
That too must remain a central issue.
No customers means no demand.
These are entirely political issues.
We must learn for the future.
This will not do.
I wish you all the best!
Why?

¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
There are two keys.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It struck me as rather odd.
We must vote accordingly.
That is not an option.
¬†¬† .
I look forward to his response.
Imagine the following situation arises.
Hence my amendments.
Well, thank you very much indeed.
What happens, however?
This will not work.
Many of the wells had to be closed.
It is certainly not enough.
Why?
This is really a Community-level issue.
All is not lost yet, however.
I support the draft directive.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† We have accepted those amendments.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Allow me to give you a few examples.
Downloading for free is not an issue.
It is possible, but not compulsory.
Again it is an issue.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
That is my firm conviction.
The draft must be adjusted accordingly.
¬†¬† .
My congratulations to him.
¬†¬† .
There is every reason for this.
Floods do not stop at borders.
No region ever gets used to floods.
¬†¬† .
The Commission cannot accept them.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Unfortunately, that was not the case.
That is the case of tourism.

That is not good enough, Commissioner.
Is it because it does not agree?
Tourism is a subsidiarity field .
¬†¬† .
What am I trying to say?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì Thank you Mr President.
Thank you.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
I simply cannot accept that logic.
I hope we can maintain this momentum.
Time matters!
We support this compromise.
This is an enormous improvement.
I have one negative comment to make.
I should¬†...
¬†¬† .
That is where the future lies.
We have the challenge of innovation.
It is also a transparency problem.
They are worse than useless.
That would be money much better spent.
In reality it is a flagship programme.
I am obliged to him for this.
Why is that the case?
Europe is weak.
That is what Amendment¬†66 proposes.
We need this Research Council.

We shall carry on working.
Congratulations, Mr¬†Potoƒçnik.
Amendment¬†66 on embryonic stem cells.
Shall we achieve this, however?
In fact I am against human cloning.
Thank you.
It is time to change these proportions!
I think he is absolutely right.
I think that is highly problematic.
I do not think we should do that.
The health programme is also important.
These cuts are extremely problematic.
¬†¬† .
We have too little crude oil and gas.
We cannot reject any of these.
We all agree on this.
That is their clear answer.
We have to improve capacities there.
It is crucial that we understand that.
They will be a crucial factor.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Our long-term responsibility is huge.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you.
¬†¬† .
‚Äì That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
They have failed to do so up to now.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That would have made more sense.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I will be voting for this resolution.
Two wrongs do not make a right.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

Thank you once again.
It is not a certainty.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I should like to add three comments.
This is just one example.
I am right behind him on that.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I want to highlight three aspects.
The first is vaccine research.
They have to exist first.
We are currently in alert phase 3.
¬†¬† .
Cooperation is very important.
It is true that progress was slow.
We need cooperation and coordination.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The judiciary is still being repressed.
That is unacceptable.
The time has come, therefore, to react.
¬†¬† .
That is not our role.
That is strange to say the least.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Energy has already been mentioned.
This year is a good time for this.
All this is obvious.
What did we awake to?

No other documents were signed.
Neither was any joint statement made.
What then could be done about this?
But it is not always so.

Did you put pressure on the Russians?

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We want both human rights and energy.
How can we do that?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
That is a monologue, not a dialogue.
¬†¬† .
Should Parliament have codecision?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
So we are aware of your point.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It provides relevant protection.
We have new legislation in place.

We are following this issue.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† . I am not aware of it.
¬†¬† .
There is no state religion in Nigeria.
¬†¬† .
If so, how extensive are they?
That concludes Question Time.
What, though, are the consequences now?
This is utterly iniquitous.
Violation by whom?

¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
We came to the right decision together.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Is that something that helps?
Have we ever really investigated this?
¬†¬† .
Let us accept that.
¬†¬† .
This policy continues to this day.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Mrs ≈Ωdanoka‚Äôs report does that.
It is another step forward.
Why?
It is important.
We cannot ignore this issue.
¬†¬† .
They were very ambitious.
That is an absolute disgrace.
We urgently need concrete measures.
We need legislation.
We need this framework decision.

And we need data.
Two points trouble us in particular.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
What stage are we at?
What can we do to move Europe forward?
What has caused this Euro-pessimism?
Let us be clear, Nice is not enough.
No.
This is a major issue.
These are two key priorities.
What are we proposing on this issue?
That is what we are going to do.
That is no longer possible today.
I do not think so.
Let us hold a debate on enlargement.
That is the great project for Europe.
We need to have succeeded by 2009.
We cannot get around this point.
I have a suggestion for France.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is won.
There is a very great lack of this.
This has to change.
When it does, you are in with a chance.
I cannot understand it.‚Äô
We would reiterate that request now.
I wish him every success in this.
They want to rule Europe as a sideline.
¬†¬† I am sorry.
What has she got to hide?
That will not be possible.
We need to face this fact.
Why, then, this deafening silence?
It is simply not good enough.
So much for democracy!
So much for the rule of law!
The voters are starting to notice.
I have just quoted Mr¬†Solana.
What should be done?
In fact, we have little choice.
Please do not disappoint them.
The question is whether that is true.
We congratulate you on it.
We must go beyond Nice.
We want a Europe that builds.
Do not listen to Polish politicians.
First of all, there is Strasbourg.
Who is in charge?
Well done.
Well done.
Which country is threatening Europe?
Only Turkey in the Aegean with its .
Is it Russia?
Well done.
It is Turkey.
Well done.
It is Turkey.
Well done.
In Turkey and you tolerate it.
Well done.
It only lasted for 51 years, however.
Why was that?
Mr¬†Barroso, I agree with you.
Which reforms?
We need initiatives.
What is it we want from Europa?
What do we expect of her?
We certainly have a clear idea.
No one understands Europe.
That is very unfortunate.
Mr Barroso, I like to see you fighting.
What is going on in the Council?
They deserve it and Europe needs them.
It is true.
Europe is not in crisis.
That is how we make progress.
That is essential.
Deepening and widening go hand in hand.
Nice is not enough.
What is the vision here?
This is the real, but negative item.
Well done, Mr Barroso.
¬†¬† .
We have made a great deal of effort.
¬†¬† .
The same applies to research.
I hope that the Council will do that.
So, let us be proud of Europe.
Let us be proud of Europe.
That is our great project for Europe.
The debate is closed.
This is not an easy task.
We should be more modest.
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.
This is for two reasons.
That concludes voting time.
¬†¬† .
Quite the contrary, in fact.
One thing is to be noted.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What are the judges thinking of?
¬†¬† .
There is worse to come, however.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Let me be clear.
They suffer from social exclusion.
¬†¬† .
That is true.
¬†¬† .
I do not believe that they are.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Have you heard?
Have you been listening?
Have you understood?
Of that there can be no doubt.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Certainly, votes can be corrected.

But what if they are not?
We need more indicators.
¬†¬† .
Our experience is quite the opposite.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The first word is integration.
The second word is governance.
Finally, the third word is monitoring.
For both we need to act.
The priority now is to achieve results.
We must move from words to action.
I disagree.
¬†¬† .
Why do I say this?
It does not make that clear.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I think that this was a mistake.
What has become of harmonisation?
No progress is being made.
Where are the practical proposals?
Look at Africa!
Who could possibly be opposed to it?
We are not opposed to the strategy.
We are also aiming at the wrong goals.
Why is that the case?
People listening to us are amazed.
The resolution is clear.
The debate is closed.
They deserve our full support.
What, then, have we set up instead?
I was very happy to be part of that.
¬†¬† .
If not, what is all the fuss about?
We must check our facts first.
Now they are not.
It is worth looking at the 2005 report.
What can we learn from this text?
I would repeat: all over Europe.
We must now move on to actions.
The time has come to act.
That is beyond dispute.
It is absolutely stuff!
Sorry about that.
We need action.
Why are parades necessary?
They are also a form of oppression.
There is none.
We stand by that. We will defend that.
Our citizens must be very puzzled.
Is it complacency?
Is it ignorance?
Is it a lack of political will?
Horror is never far away.
You never forget it once it happens.
Will it stop the hatred?
No, it will not.
That is a deep shame.
Let us do something about it.
This freedom is not always respected.
All this is entirely to be condemned.
We have to find a common language.
That is very important.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is the debate on
¬†¬† .
It is something much more important.
It is life.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Have they been solved yet?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr¬†Winkler.
Your reply is satisfactory, of course.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Are you thinking along these lines?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you for your answer.
If yes, then what are those interests?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We cannot find any of those.
¬†¬† .
I beg your indulgence.
I really cannot give you an answer.
¬†¬† .
I am very optimistic.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I do not see it like that.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That concludes Question Time.
We must meet that expectation.



¬†¬† .
In general I welcome this proposal.
¬†¬† .
We too have tabled two amendments.
¬†¬† .
This is not accurate.


¬†¬† .

I applaud the report.
Is this really the case, however?


¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
You spared no effort, Mr¬†Cramer!
¬†¬† .
It is all set out very clearly.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
On the contrary, the gap has widened.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The subject matter is vast and varied.
Thank you for your attention.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
Secondly, the lack of young people.
Training must go further, however.
My group has two objections, though.
I disagree, for two reasons.
Inshore fishing is of great importance.


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
We have more than met that obligation.
On all the key points we agree.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We are keen to debate this with him.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
I would like to make two brief points.
Afterwards is always too late.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Mr B√∂sch, first of all, thank you.
What now though?
This is not being done.
This must be followed up by action.
Another huge waste.
Everyone talks about transparency.
Fortunately, something is happening.
This is a step in the right direction.
Is Turkey to join?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.
We must not slow down the pace.
We shall attend to this in due course.
It is not a technical issue.
The amendment would read as follows:
I hope the House can accept this.
It is as simple as that.
¬†¬† We have now finished voting.
Congratulations to everybody.
¬†¬† .
It should be continued.
This approach should also be continued.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† . I voted for this report.
¬†¬† .
This semi-legitimation is dangerous.
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
These amendments were defeated.
I voted against this.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is a compromise amendment.
Adopting the euro is not a good idea.
As Frenchmen we know this.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Our policies must deliver for everyone.
Allow me to say a few words on it.
¬†¬† .
All too soon I have been proved right.
It is crucial to condemn them publicly.
¬†¬† .
To name but two of these:
This is a welcome step.
¬†¬† .

National laws underpin these rights.
¬†¬† .
Hence our abstention.
¬†¬† .

I shall summarise it for you:
But who is protecting European wine?

We are calling for your help.

Why should this be, you ask?
Why should they?
That strikes me as crucial.
We need clarity in this area.
There is a clear need for action.
Did I understand him correctly?
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
What can the European Commission do?
There has clearly been some progress.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5 p.m.
We are not seen as having clean hands.
It is a crazy world, right enough.
We are not seen as being the good guys.
They have peaceful intentions.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5 p.m.
The date of the execution is not known.
Son Jong Nam is an innocent man.
¬†¬† .
My group welcomes this approach.


¬†¬† .



The issue is still under discussion.
Of this I am in no doubt.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5 p.m.
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.
His death is a loss to all of us.
¬†¬† .



Thank you very much.
¬†¬† .
We cannot be complacent.
¬†¬† .
Everything is connected.
We must look to the future.
Now to my final remark.
¬†¬† .
What results do we see today?
We are the only ones not doing so.
That is the only route to take.


¬†¬† .
That is even worse than .
A great deal has been promised.
What has actually changed?
What has become of those?
Now we no longer hear about them.
That will not do.
That will not do either.
We are attacking again.
Everything was postponed and put off.
This list amounts to a great deal.
What exactly has it achieved?
What does this phrase actually mean?
We need to alter our transport policy.


We support this wholeheartedly.
You will do it again.
How is that for symbolism?
I am just floating the idea.
Think about it!
Let us stop whining and blaming.
We are actually doing quite well.
We need concrete actions.
You know what is needed.
But what should this role be?

We have fought for that.
This is something we need to debate.
Firstly, the issue of the US summit.
We are surely all aware of that.
Foreign policy is also important.
These issues are being discussed.
We are also exploiting the new media.
It was sometimes an uphill struggle.
I am very happy about this.
That is to say, it is only right.
Today it is half that.
This is a win-win situation.
We must speak truthfully.
Allow me to speak openly here.
We need some new elements.
We all know this.
People must already be aware of that.
I am of a different opinion.
Nobody knows about them, however.
That is democracy, after all.
I wish them well.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mrs¬†Krupa.
So we need to do something.
We need to do something.
We have case law.
We have to call a spade a spade.
It must be respected and protected‚Äô?
I am not the only one who is worried.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mrs¬†Badia.

How is that possible?
Was it foolishness or something else?
It does not matter.
That is something we cannot support.
¬†¬† That concludes this item.
¬†¬† .
Did we the institutions get it right?
Did the Member States get it right?
How can we do better in the future?
Hence we will need a little more time.
Their stories have been heartrending.
It does not always fit.
I should jolly well hope so!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The Commission needs to address this.
¬†¬† .
It did not choose to do so.
¬†¬† .
The first is about solvency.
I doubt whether this has happened.
¬†¬† .
If they were, they were saying nothing.
So, the Irish were kept in ignorance.
That is a problem.
Were others notified?
That is a key question.
Is it the Commission?


I commend Mrs Wallis‚Äôs report.
It is a very thorough interim report.
I look forward to what he has to say.
¬†¬† .
Both supervisors have roles to play.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The regulators failed.
The regulators failed.
¬†¬† , .
We have four messages to put across.
Is there no solution at all?
There is another point related to this.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Nobody has thought this through.
I doubt it.
These principles must be proclaimed.
I ask that question of Mr McCreevy.
¬†¬† .
Well, I believe it is.
I do not agree with her.
That is a matter entirely for them.
The market should decide that.
I have read what he said in his book.
There is a reason for that.
We should not always be so defensive.
I would agree with what they say.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
I deplore that.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
I can quite understand his reaction.
I am honestly convinced of that.
That is an absolute must.
These things are steadily escalating.
Allow me to make one more point.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I am sure it cannot do that!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Annex ‚Äì Position of the Commission
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Our consultation has been successful.
I have heard the views expressed.
Instead, it can be renewed.
Pacta sunt servanda.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Do not take measures against us.
I think they should look at this again.
¬†¬† .
This cannot be allowed to continue.
Every one of us can do something too.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Is this an inevitable process?
I hope not.
Flying is unnaturally cheap.
Aviation is expanding rapidly.
Do we need legislation?
Do not hold your breath.
They are outmoded and overloaded.
I am much obliged to the rapporteur.
We cannot wait any longer.
Why is that the case?
Would we need further schemes?
This does not make any sense.
It makes sense to do it that way.
This deadline expired a long time ago.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
We must monitor this situation.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
What have we now achieved?
This is clearly a good thing.
Thank you, Mr¬†Blokland.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
That is what we are doing now.
Freedom returned in 1975.

We all know that spirit.
Franco lost.
Nothing better could happen to Europe!
Thank you very much.
They are almost all dead.
We have named a prize after him.
Almost 7¬†000 priests were murdered.
We lack such statesmen today.
This has to change!
To be honest, it does not.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Much remains to be done.
¬†¬† .
We need well-qualified people.
Enough people have tried.
He can count on our support.
This is no exaggeration.
Are they large or small?
Mrs¬†de¬†Br√∫n began by speaking Irish.
Irish is now an official language.
It is a gift that is no gift.
At last!

I myself will try to help answer this.


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We very much count on you.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
No.
Who decided it was ‚Äòdesirable‚Äô?
¬†¬† .
Hence our abstention.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We therefore voted against.
¬†¬† .
This is unacceptable.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
And for what?

What is it playing at?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Taxpayers have been warned.
An additional tax?
Surely not.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
There is no quick technical solution.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

The current situation is worrying.
Let me be clear.
¬†¬† .
This would undermine the current ETS.
¬†¬† .
When will my job be on the line?
When will it be my turn?
We must not close our eyes to that.
We can, however, back them to the hilt.
There will be consolidations.
Aid awards were authorised in 2002.
That is good news.
But what happens then in Portugal?
We are not against change.
We are for change.
That is our task in Parliament.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
One was about structural change.
So, what is the secret?
Well, there are a few key factors.
Firstly, then, the long-term approach.
That way, new jobs can be created.
Restructuring will be needed.
This will be increasingly important.

There is nothing new about this.
We are treating it as if it were new.
It is going to come from profits.
That is the reality of industrial life.
It has been there for a long time.
The issue is how we deal with it.
Surely that means they are competitive!
That is surely bad economics!
This is why this debate is worthwhile.
More needs to be done.
The debate is closed.


If not, we will be left behind.
The clock is ticking here as well.
The first point concerns research.
¬†¬† .
It was cut almost by half.
I will start with the darker aspects.
Of course, there are standards too.
That is precisely where we now stand.
It is not.
That is often where the knowledge is.
Why?
Why?

So, above all, let us do our work.
I shall refer to three issues.
In order to develop, one must invest.
This must change!
Thank you!
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
That is the question.
Nokia is a good example.
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The question is quite clear.
Can I ask if you are serious?
They want to follow their team.
Will you look at this again?
¬†¬† .
I shall answer the first question.
Am I serious?
Yes, I am quite serious.
¬†¬† .
So far so good!
¬†¬† .
I welcome that initiative very much.
Has he any idea of the timescale?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
They need to get a foot in the door.
Thank you very much.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We will happily take that up.
¬†¬† .
He was injured recently.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you, Commissioner Frattini.
¬†¬† .
Then please help us.
We are committed to this.
¬†¬† .
These include disabled ex-prisoners.
What is the consequence?
My question was included on the list.
I am sorry.
Like you, I am aware of the situation.

¬†¬† .
That concludes Question Time.
1.
2.
3.
4.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.


What is this all about?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Mr¬†President, I shall conclude.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is the first step.


¬†¬† .
For goodness sake.
We need non-regression.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This may lead to confusion.

¬†¬† .
We are seen as passive bystanders.
No one looks for our consent.
¬†¬† .
That also applies to nuclear energy.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
The world around us will not wait.
This should not be forgotten.
It needs to be taken seriously.
That time is here and now.
¬†¬† .
This is for us a question of principle.
I welcome this.

¬†¬† .
Their absence is excusable.
¬†¬† .
First, the market-driven programme.
You have not said anything about that.
I would therefore advise caution.
That is the reality of Europe.
You have not given Europe a direction.
That is what your speech was lacking.
¬†¬† .
That policy is now being continued.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Do not make me laugh!
I will not be holding my breath.
Our citizens also expect that.
Its coolness is invigorating.
This is very discouraging indeed.
You did not say anything about this.
Why not?
Where is your leader‚Äôs approach?


Promises ought to be kept.
There is no room for complacency.
Let me turn, thirdly, to Russia.
There are many worrying signs.
Work well, and with zeal!


That is not all, though.
Your speech was lacking in spirit.

There is good cause for this.
We must not allow this.
We agree.
In other words, more and better Europe.
I wish the Presidency every success!
We speak Latin in Europe.
The President will have our support.
I should very much like to see this.
I wish you good luck.
First it must be well prepared.
Secondly, it must be objective.
There is an interesting correlation.
Those two things can go hand in hand.
Good luck to the Presidency.
¬†¬† .
This chain is necessary.
The Commission sits for five years.
We have to devote our energies to that.
It is not.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I now repeat that call.
We have had to seek new ways.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
You have our full support in this.
¬†¬† .
Let us have some consistency.
He who sows despair, reaps violence.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
We cannot sit idly by and watch.
There are extremists on both sides.
Stop this carnage, you have gone mad!
I put that question to the Council.
What more does Israel want?
But where is the challenge from Europe?
Well how, precisely?
This is the main point.




¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is a vicious circle.
He must be released unharmed.
All sides must exercise restraint.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† Thank you, Sir Robert.
I did check.
That is what prolonged it.
All the best to you, Terry.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you for your remarks.
Therefore that was in order.
¬†¬† .
This is a justified, welcome report.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
These amendments were as follows:
We deeply regret this.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our abstention.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our decision to abstain.
¬†¬† .
We tabled the declaration together.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you.
¬†¬† .
Many of them have since disappeared.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is our conclusion.
What, though, did our governments do?
They did nothing.
The US has taken a lead in this war.
I agree with Mr¬†Piotrowski.
The committee needs more time.
This is a question that we need to ask.
This inquiry must therefore continue.
Thirdly, whom do you want to punish?
The world is flat.
If that is true it is very dangerous.
Secrecy should not mean illegality.
This is morally and legally monstrous.


We condemn the practices of the CIA.
Why should we continue?
Why else do we need to extend the time?
I include the US in that.
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .

Emphatically, enough is enough.
There are two problems here.


The pillars cannot apply here.
There are no pillars.
It is one thing.
¬†¬† .
That is the structural difference.
The debate is closed.

Now the technical work is being done.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
There are a lot of these this week.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Somehow it must be improved.
¬†¬† .
That concludes Question Time.
Visas are issued in capital cities.

¬†¬† .
Not even the fee is to be reduced.
This is a very important issue for us.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We have a ceasefire.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It is welcome and I am glad about it.
I am glad about that.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
This will be the aim of this new tool.
Thank you once again.
To date we have had minimal resources.
¬†¬† .
So what should we do?
So what is the obstacle?

The fourth theme is integration.
The fifth theme is illegal immigration.
¬†¬† .
I hope we see evidence of that.
It is positive for a series of reasons.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
There is one tragedy after another.

It responds late and ineffectually.
¬†¬† .
This is a great benefit to Europe.
What should we be working towards?
Above all, they need to trade.
They are doing a marvellous job.
What happens, however?
It says everything about us.
Immigration is not a police matter.
Let us avoid this problem.
This is the moment of truth.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the debate.
But we have been left to our fate.
Is Europe inhospitable?
Today it costs USD 200.
Thank you for your attention.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This, for me, is a major concern.
That would be my cause for concern.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Now they are French.
Congratulations.
¬†¬† .
Half of these are women.
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
The immigrants have indeed adapted.
I will mention two of them.
What is the upshot of this?
Immigrants without papers?
No.
Yes.

I am talking about the brain drain.
¬†¬† .
This is something I consider important.
I know that in this area you have none.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
We had highly constructive exchanges.
¬†¬† .
It is also a stimulus to the brain.
An individual makes a personal choice.
That should be our test.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
He said it was OK, but he missed Ghana.
I was in Ghana last year.
We cannot have Fair Trade on the cheap.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I agree with the Commissioner.
It is a very fine report.
Fair Trade is a success story.
¬†¬† .
That is obvious.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is Voting Time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Please adopt this instrument.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
Thus, in Amendment¬†15, after:
there must be added:
¬†¬† ‚Äì That concludes Voting Time.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Why duplicate this task?
¬†¬† .
I utterly repudiate this approach.
¬†¬† .
They are mocking the world.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Wake up, Mr¬†Lambrinidis.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .



Integration is a two-way process.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

Do you know if he is coming?
Our message must be crystal clear.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I wonder whether the US has a mandate.
Where do we go?
What is the situation?
What is the position?
I have one or two questions.
¬†¬† .
We will do what is reasonable.
There is nothing altruistic about this.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
This is also a question of justice.
So let me now come to our proposal.
That might help considerably.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It permits informed consumer decisions.
Why not?
However, that is not the point.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Military engagement is not our way.
So what can we do?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
It certainly is not!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This situation is unacceptable.
¬†¬† .
Let us take Belarus as an example.
These are the facts.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.
‚Äòeven‚Äô.
That concludes the vote.
¬†¬† .
Unfortunately, that did not happen.
They want to get to Europe.


We have heard that before.
¬†¬† We shall do so again.
The matter is incredibly important.
That is why we gave the game away.
It is an unbelievable figure.
Remember the tsunami?
But you will not face up to Iran!
Some summer recess!
That is totally unacceptable.
If we act now, we can act in time.
This should not be the case.
However, they fail to do so.
It is likely that they have died.
If so, then let it be the last.
We need:
Why is all this happening?
Our fears have been realised.
It is time to give up that silly myth.
The one we get will not be the same.
¬†¬† That concludes this item.
¬†¬† .
I wish him good luck.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That definitely cannot be sensible.
As I say, new cars are also safer.
We hope to see a better proposal.
¬†¬† .
I flew out from Heathrow this morning.
That is simply unacceptable.
That was what I had to say.
¬†¬† .
So what would such a notion mean?
Is that harmonisation, or is it not?
The new tax is, by definition, unfair.
That is what we need.
¬†¬† ‚Äì Let us face reality.
It is not easy but we can do it.

It is a huge issue.
We need justice at long last.
We need a uniform standard.
In that I agree wholly with Mrs Doyle.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
Thank you for your proposal.
Naturally, we support it.
This is a crime against humanity.

The best cure is prevention.
I believe we can go further.
¬†¬† .
We must be quite clear on that point.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.

However, we can be better prepared.
¬†¬† .
One relates to Forest Focus.
That is absurd.
Biomass needs to be promoted.
¬†¬† .
Why?
Who is behind this natural disaster?
We must learn from our mistakes.
That shows real urgency.
However, that is not enough.
The result has been a disaster.
Do you know?
This year has sadly been no exception.
The Galicians are a Europeanist people.
¬†¬† .
Otherwise, we cannot deliver more!
Let us look towards the future.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
It will help to stabilise the country.
¬†¬† .
I do not regard that as a good sign.
This is a tragic world record.
I have never seen an election like it.
¬†¬† .
Which Belgian economic interests?
It needs such investment.
Why?
That is true, Mr¬†Pfl√ºger.
Personally, I can do nothing.
This chapter is now closed.
You cannot just say anything.
The same applies to the police.
I think we must talk about this.
This is my personal conviction.
The Congo has everything.
This is the real debate.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
That deal will be hard to reach.
Nothing can replace the WTO.
That remains my priority.
These costs arise, :
¬†¬† .
Qualified access is what is needed.
What was it meant to develop?
That is the core issue.
I have always said that I do not.
We want trade.
¬†¬† .
It is time to remember that.
Let us make no mistake about that.
This is not surprising.
This is a fallacy.
It is time to move on.
¬†¬† .
It is time to set that blame aside.
We must not move backwards.
It really is worth trying to do that.
My second comment relates to farming.
Multilateral agreement is essential.
We wish you well in that task.
I think not.
Lastly, what about CAP reforms?
That will take time.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr Kamall.
We need to and must do the same.
¬†¬† .
I will be working to that end.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
She is one of the pioneers.
¬†¬† .
I am proud of this achievement.
This and only this will be fruitful.
I wonder why¬†‚Ä¶

Is being imprudent, however, a crime?
There is much to do in this field.
We must therefore take measures.
Penalties must suddenly get stricter.
This is a crime.
We need to fight drugs effectively.
They worked fifteen hours a day.
I cannot help that.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
You can rely on our cooperation.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.

¬†¬† The next item is voting time.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
¬†¬† .
Allow me to wax nostalgic for a moment.
Things turned out otherwise, however.
The Middle East is our neighbour.
¬†¬† That will be reviewed.
It may well be the case.
The main items for me are important.
¬†¬† .
This is discrimination.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This has to change once and for all.
I have thus voted against this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Children are also affected.
¬†¬† .
Human dignity must come first.
This is not strictly true.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Taxation cannot be the only solution.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
This is 3.7% up on the budget for 2006.
¬†¬† .
This is a budget for 27 Member States.
I am not going to repeat our position.
We think it is realistic and grounded.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.



¬†¬† .

Far from it, in fact.
Therefore, this report is irrelevant!
That is of vital importance.
Moreover, sometimes they are correct.
These are the facts.
Technology should show us the way.
Jobs are being lost to technology.

As for this report, it is generally ok.
Something has to be done.
We must help to do it.
Our constituents want reform.
I am really pleased with that.
Mr Crowley welcomed the report.
What should its features be?


¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.

¬†¬† .
Please take that as a given.
What has happened?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
What do they do?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
So it cannot be a cover-up.
Some companies have done that.
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
I will be reporting to the ministers.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Can you also supply figures for this?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We have two approaches.
I think the message is quite strong.
¬†¬† .
Definitely, I agree.
¬†¬† .
I am afraid not.
I conducted a small poll myself.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The exact opposite is true.
¬†¬† .
What more can we do?
Has it been?
If not, when do you expect this report?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We do not know.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That ban is a temporary one.
Is that an acceptable way to continue?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I shall be as brief as possible.
That is the main problem.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Where there is a will there is a way.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you for your question, Mr Evans.
That concludes Question Time.
Here are a few figures.
What are we talking about?
I quote the WHO‚Äôs definition.
What is being done?
Little or nothing!
We have an efficient health system.
Our health professions are monitored.
The world is, in fact, unprotected.
Borders are extremely porous.
We have a wide range of partners.
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
That is indeed the priority.
Another example relates to AIDS.
The debate is closed.
That is extremely important.
I look forward to the debate.
The public has not always liked that.
Stigma is rampant in all our countries.
My report is about these things.
That makes public belief possible.
¬†¬† .

Getting it right is so important.
It is not only treatment that matters.
¬†¬† .
I do not agree with this point of view.
Thank you, John.
I would fully agree with you.
Ten times that number attempt suicide.
He has written an excellent report.
Take drug addiction.
Only somatic illnesses are tolerated.
I have just one more thing to say.
Why is society so ill?
What are the causes?
The statistics reflect the cruel truth.
But at what price?
Patients still have no say.
Patient organisations followed suit.
The focus here is on prevention.
¬†¬† .
I shall be brief.
They will all take gender into account.
Ageing is a reality and a fact.
We have an ageing population.
The point is to make ageing healthy.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
That is why this project must continue.


It seems to be a happy coincidence.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This covers a number of issues.
What are these values?
Do they cover human rights?
The rights of minorities?
Yes or no?
This has only been the case in part.
Which party can limit this sovereignty?
We must endeavour to create capacities.
Would we do any better?
This is the real problem.
It also has a cost.
It is there in writing.
Two elements are therefore required.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .


¬†¬† .
I would like to make three points.
We must stay firm on this.
That is what I want him to tell us.


This is obvious, of course.
That is not the case at all.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
These deficiencies must be corrected.
I have received six amendments.
Finally, respect for minorities.

I find this a little strange.
What is the story here?
What answer is there to that?
That is the percentage.
Is that not the truth?


Albania is facing enormous problems.
The third problem is women‚Äôs rights.
¬†¬† Office.
I thank all of you very much.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is the vote.
I ask that negotiations be commenced.
¬†¬† ‚Äì That concludes the vote.
As far as I am aware, little was done.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
In this way, voters are being lied to.
We therefore voted against the report.
¬†¬† .
The answer is: without fear.
It is time to react!
I have thus voted against this report.
I welcome this debate.
These objectives are commendable.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We need to break the deadlock.
¬†¬† .
We cannot go on much longer like this.
I believe they are right.
What are we aiming for?
I was deeply moved by that.

¬†¬† .
That would be a fatal error.
And of course we must go further.
We must speak with one voice.
We have long-term tasks too.
He has a mandate, but of what kind?
What is the European Union's role now?
That is the problem.
Mr¬†Watson is right.
It wants an Islamic area!


¬†¬† .
We are right to be pleased about this.
We must never forget it.
You rightly said so, Mr¬†Tuomioja.
There are other priorities, too.
There can be no peace without that.
This is our responsibility.

We know what has to happen.
Yes, it is.
What did he expect?
The words have been subverted.
The war was brewing.
We let it brew.
It was planned.
We did do so.
Did our secret services not know this?
Nothing was done about this.
Europe must raise its voice.
We do not have them yet.
We do not have to reinvent the wheel.
That is the way to proceed.
Let us look forward.
Europe has something to contribute.
Our road map has several objectives.
He says, ‚ÄòGaza has been reoccupied.
The world must know this (...).
It is in its worst condition, ever.
I turn now to the war in Lebanon.
On this, are our hands clean?

What can we offer there?
UNIFIL II must be successful.
I agree with all that.
Enough said.
His name is Renan.
He is a DJ.
Where were the international observers?
Now for the final matter, Commissioner.
It is time for Europe to wake up.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
Israel‚Äôs action was disproportionate.
One of the criteria referred to is age.
¬†¬† .
This event is proof of the fact.
Question No 17 has been withdrawn.
That concludes Question Time.
Please be patient, Mr¬†Speroni.
Allow me, then, to do so.
That is all.
¬†¬† .
That is rather revealing.
¬†¬† .
We all know the key challenges.
What principles should guide us?

¬†¬† .
The death penalty?
Respect for international law?
The demilitarisation of security?
Climate change?
That cannot be taken seriously.
Nothing more.
The rest is nothing but fine words.
¬†¬† .
He brought China to its knees.
This must be guaranteed.
Why?
This would be for our mutual benefit.
That would make me very unhappy.
The two must go hand-in-hand.

Secondly: Europol.
The reasons are as follows.
Her commitment is evident.
Be fair in your ...
Even so, the rules must be observed.
I think we should.
China also imports oil from Sudan.
We are not na√Øve.
Yet I also support a language of truth.
I have a few comments.
That is a moral outrage.
Secondly, there is Tibet.
Thirdly, there is Taiwan.
We are in a win-win situation.
¬†¬† .
Let me also say a word on Taiwan.
This is important.
That is the situation at present.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.



There is a host of confusing messages.
We have an election in Sweden.
I shall end on that happy note.



Woe betide if we ignore them.
I fully support what he says.
¬†¬† Thank you, Mr¬†Nicholson.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Such is the nature of modern life.
This is something we should pursue.


¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
That is the best way forward.
That is quite clear.
We must fight terrorism together.
That is not the way forward.
Two stages are therefore required.
Has the Commission thought about this?
Can we trust the Commission on that?
It is already an embarrassment.
It will be ignored by the Council.


With what jurisdiction was it held?
Who convened this meeting?
What does it mean?
Why is it necessary?
Why is it proportionate?
Why is this?
Is it Mr Frattini‚Äôs fault?
Is it due to the Council?
Why?
It is a mockery of the people.
She has said what had to be said.
Europe must speak with one voice.
For this, the Council is in disgrace.

What do we need?
The other point is positive profiling.
Why are we considering such a system?
Think about frequent fliers.
‚Äì The joint debate is closed.

Much remains to be done in this area.
That is what frightens me.
That is our main goal now.
Pearls are small and hidden.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is voting time.

‚Äì That concludes voting time.
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
¬†¬† .
This is poor form.
I do not support a one-China policy!
I am thus voting against this report.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is a bad start.
What is to be done?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We are aware of the risks, however.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Much more can and must be done.
This failure is incomprehensible.
This failure was incendiary.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We therefore voted against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We should be realistic here.
There is, however, good news to report.
Let me make something clear.
This is in our power ‚Äì it must be.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
I refer to Cuba and North Korea.
They are not economic migrants.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
It has not done so.
How do things stand?
What can we do?
It shows the limits of our power.
Can we find other means?
What was said confirms our concerns.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately.
¬†¬† ‚Äì The next item is voting time.
¬†¬† ‚Äì That concludes voting time.
¬†¬† .
There is another reason.
That event should be on all our minds.
Dear colleagues, that was a shame!
I hope we all agree on that.
This is a shame.
That is not the problem.
That is not the right path, either.

Some of them are from outside Europe.
It teaches us mutual love and respect.
I was astounded.
Is that what Plan D is about?
Is that dialogue?
It is called indentured labour.
That is scandalous.
I have taken good note of your request.
¬†¬† Thank you.
We need to step up our efforts.

This cannot be accepted.
They replied that they did not.
I think I must stop here.
I will start with PM10.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Mr¬†Krahmer.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Why am I saying this?
The level of ambition is very low.
That is our position.
Thank you very much.
¬†¬† .
We know the importance of that sector.
¬†¬† .
That is the challenge.
Thank you.
Good luck for the future.
I wish you all the best for the future.

I am indebted to them all.
I have run out of excuses back home.
It is not enough to set limit values.
We therefore need to be flexible.
¬†¬† .
So there is a difference on this point.
This is what the health experts say.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
In Europe, 80% of people live in towns.
We can learn from each other.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
There can be no objection to that.
A discharge is always about the past.
I would like to make three points.
There is no denying it.
That is perfectly okay.
Who is actually responsible for this?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
3.

I wish briefly to raise two matters.
¬†¬† .
This is a process.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
So what are the practical steps?
¬†¬† .
The Commission shares those concerns.
I fully agree with Mr Beazley.

This is a very important subject.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Let us endeavour to summarise it.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.

¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Thank you.
We must not delude ourselves.
EQFs are not a straightforward matter.
This is a very important shift.
Mrs¬†Jensen has mentioned 32 countries.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
Moreover, it is changing all the time.
There is quite simply no alternative.
Such action is essentially pragmatic.
Mr Barroso, you mentioned healthcare.
That is not on!
I do not think that makes sense.
¬†¬† .
But what is subsidiarity?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Of course not!
¬†¬† .
I favour a framework directive.
We need to search for that.
That is also an urgent matter.
Why?
This is not an alternative.
It is a trap.
Our fellow citizens are not blind.
My family were farmers and craftsmen.
We must make use of this report.
‚Äì He was wrong.
That is called democracy.
What have we achieved?
It has been only vaguely defined.
We have work to do on competition law.
Have nothing to do with it.
That is the message of the report.
I do not think that is wise.
It adds no value whatsoever.
That to me is completely anti-European.
What is the right solution?
Let us stay clear of it.
I do not believe in tax harmonisation.
¬†¬† .
Let us acknowledge the fact.
I do not agree.
On the contrary.
They are none of its business.
That is not the case.
What is the agreement about?
He is promising us a communication.
We are waiting impatiently for it.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
Reality has borne this out.
It is not good enough.
¬†¬† , .
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† .
You have the floor, Madam President.
¬†¬† .
HIV/Aids rates had soared.
Their dreams are not complicated.
But time is pressing.
We cannot afford to let that happen.
We want to change that.
We have already started the process.
Our roads are in a terrible state.
In summary, we are off to a good start.
It is just a start.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
¬†¬† We shall resume the vote.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.
It is a matter for the Member States.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Any standardisation must be avoided.
Hence our abstention.
And by whom?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I therefore abstained.
¬†¬† .
Hence our abstention.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
There are two main reasons for this.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is why we will be voting against.
There are several lessons to be drawn.
Social Europe starts with us.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
The people of Europe have spoken.
Their voice must be recognised.
¬†¬† .
In other words, they saw us coming!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I do not think that this is justified.
¬†¬† .
Hence our abstention.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We must bear this in mind at all times.
The shortcomings must be remedied.
I was born in Western Europe.
Now we are supposed to give it money?
What we are doing now is no different.
¬†¬† .
Size matters.
Forge it with us.
We build the European Union together.
It must be built from the ground up.
We will all be winners.
We decided to say yes a year ago.
Well done, the ball is in your court!
We said that when there were ten of us.
We said it when there were fifteen!
I have had enough!
They must become European.
The problem is: how?
There is a funnel effect.
When and how will it come?
How can you know it will come?
The fact is, have got problems.
Unanimity is not required.
It will be much easier with 27!
But how?
For my part, I think we are hypocrites.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
We peer at them and lecture them.
They turned into a win-win situation.
Size is not an indication of strength.
¬†¬† .
This is a pity.
Well done Bulgaria ‚Äì and welcome!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† ‚Äì The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
¬†¬† .
Unfortunately they have slowed down.
So why then is there criticism?
I will mention a few vital areas.
Some people have been set free.
I was in Turkey a few weeks ago.
So please let this stop.
A last major point: Cyprus.
I have been speaking for too long.
We need concrete results.
Terrorist acts can never be justified.
¬†¬† .
Terrorism is our common enemy.
Only then can we make progress.
But it is not the one people say.
Mr¬†Erdogan, do you perhaps have a map?
It is time to speak the truth.
This situation is preposterous.
This is the whole truth about Turkey.
She speaks of hooligan lawyers.

These are serious issues.
Turkey is calling the shots.
This has proven to be the case.
That is not the EU‚Äôs job.
This sent out a clear signal.
I ask myself what we want, therefore.
This is not fair treatment.
That should be upheld in our report.
That surprises me greatly.
The answer is a clear ‚Äòno‚Äô.
The people are very critical of it.
What we feared last year has come true.
The process of reform has petered out.
Is this kind of candidate acceptable?
Cyprus is a litmus test.





How?
Does that help Turkey?
I do not think so.
I totally agree with him.
That leaves less than four years.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This will not be a children‚Äôs story.
I am not at all convinced about that.
It took that step.
Turkey aspires to join Europe.
I should like to add something.
That is not what accession is about.
Mr¬†Michel, you have the floor again.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
You are right.
There are two ways to fight that.
¬†¬† .
We are working very hard.
I have two questions.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This is a very important question.
¬†¬† .
The question was also about agencies.
The Council‚Äôs proposal has two parts.
But that is another matter.
We did this with the amended budget.
We need to work towards that.
I protest strongly about this.
Mr Figel‚Äô, you have the floor again.
That would be very useful.
We are working on that.
¬†¬† .
What did you just say to us?
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
These letters are handled carefully.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
You are quite right.
Needs change and new needs arise.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
¬†¬† We understand your position.
Euro notes are of quite a high quality.
Montenegro is a specific issue.
¬†¬† The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
There is indeed a problem.
I hope it will be sustained.
I say they should not.
Therefore, I oppose this proposal.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
I should like to make four comments.
All of that is very complicated.
This also applies to disabled people.
I say not.
Our work does not end today.

We hope that it will be of use to both.
What will come of this?
We can still hope for the best.

I have no problem with that.
I speak from experience.
I do not exaggerate.
Why?
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Sources can be used:
It is now up to us¬†‚Ä¶
The programme is considerably delayed.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
You have mentioned a Green Paper.
That is the true purpose of the debate.
¬†¬† .
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
These are:
This was also discussed at Tampere.
¬†¬† .
We have made a start, but just a start.
Let me now turn to the ‚Äò clause‚Äô.
Finally, citizens do want more Europe.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
That is not news to any of us.
It is desperately needed.
Our citizens demand better.
Are you sure?
Of course there is some progress.
Let us make a humanitarian gesture!
¬†¬† .
It is a pre-constitutional debate.
Indecisiveness reigned supreme.
Were the bullets Spanish or Moroccan?
Thousands, perhaps.
Who are they, and what are their names?
Why this bellicose language?
Have we gone to war against migrants?
That is the crime they have committed.
It is an affront to civilisation.
I would beg you never to do it again.
She is an old lady with a low income.
This really is a very serious problem.
You have been warned!
So I say, thank you, Switzerland!
Thank you, Christoph Blocker!
Long live Switzerland!
I was there in a different capacity.
I believe that that is also important.

They are passing through the Canaries.
It is a way of getting into Europe.
Please allow me to add another concern.
There is only room for two messages.
This is the root of the evil.
Thank you.
¬†¬† Mr President, here we are again.
Mr Schulz was quite right.
That was a positive first step.
The answer is, unfortunately, no.
What can we do?
That is not on!
What can we do?
Hence my protest.
No more idle talk, Minister!
Let that be used at last.
Those shortcomings have to be remedied.
What has caused the delay?
I look forward to his doing so.
That is deplorable.
There have been 63 speakers.
¬†¬† Thank you, Minister.
That is what you are hearing.
That, too, is solidarity.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow.
‚Äì a warm welcome to you all!
It is central to our work.
¬†¬† The next item is the vote.
¬†¬† .
We consider it a translation error.
Is anybody opposed?
Is anybody opposed?
Is anybody opposed?
¬†¬† That concludes the vote.

Wait and see¬†...
Let us be vigilant.
Why did we not vote for it?
That would be perfectly natural.
¬†¬† .
When will we ever learn?
Yet we keep trying again.
We are fiddling while Rome burns.
¬†¬† .
I therefore voted in favour again.
We therefore voted against.
What is meant by State control?
What is meant by mixed-economy society?
I hope that it is not a final defeat.

¬†¬† .
We can find a legal basis.
¬†¬† .



We disagree on these two points.

Talk about hypocrisy!
Why?
What message is being sent out?

It is disgraceful!
Josef Ratzinger is not Javier Solana.
That is unacceptable.
Who can believe such a tale?
This is a different view of Europe.
¬†¬† . ‚Äì We voted against this text.
¬†¬† .
Why, then, do I have this huge regret?
On this basis I abstained.
¬†¬† That concludes this item.
All this depends on improved security.
And that is something we cannot afford.
¬†¬† .
This is unfounded.
They are greatly mistaken.
You talked about the key players.
Not for a moment has this been imposed.

It is now that Darfur needs Europe.
This situation is totally unbearable.
¬†¬† .
It is an absolute catastrophe.
The UN and the EU must act.
They have been entirely in vain.
Europe cannot adopt such a policy!
The Russians supply the arms.
How do you think you would feel?
All is set for a massacre.
Darfur is one of them.
No!
Europe has a powerful role to play.
On 20¬†October we have the summit.
What steps should be taken?
There are some other middle paths.
That is another concrete possibility.
I shall end my speech with two remarks.
The debate is closed.

It must take its neighbours with it.

The level of illiteracy is almost 40%.
Today, the subject is trade with India.
The report is excellent.
The situation is worse than that.
They do have rights, but only on paper.



This has to change.
It will not be automatic.
Recently, the news has been good.
I shall conclude.
Terrorism is the curse of our age.
If afflicts many European countries.
It seemed an obvious choice.
That all seemed eminently sensible.
Are we working towards it?
Has this become a reality?
Unfortunately, it has not.

¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The sitting is now suspended.
That is provocative.
Finally, let me just say:
The answer is, very little.
Do you remember trade agreements?

¬†¬† The debate is closed.
The report was adopted unanimously.

¬†¬† .
Let us be clear.
¬†¬† .
Support measures need to be taken.
The sea conceals many dangers.
¬†¬† .
I will try to respond to some of them.
Those are the facts.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.

Allow me to give an example.
¬†¬† .
This is an important topic.
¬†¬† .
We must put a stop to this!
Most of these fish perish.
¬†¬† .
The same applies in the case of cod.
The same applies to Amendment¬†20.
No wonder the Norwegians said no!
Norwegian stocks remain in good order.
This report will do nothing.
¬†¬† That brings the debate to a close.
First they made gestures at me.
I tried to avoid going ‚Äò‚Äô.
I take good note of your complaint.
¬†¬† .
This is the crux of the matter.
The real issue here is so much bigger.
We are killing too many sharks.
We have to stop that.
To increase it to 6.5% would be crazy.
We also want high welfare standards.
We need to set an example to the world.
We must take action.
¬†¬† Thank you very much.
The debate is closed.

The rapporteur has five minutes.
I am going to ask him just to use four.
We find that too imprecise.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† Thank you very much.
¬†¬† .
I am involved in several amendments.
But yes, the organic sector is growing.
¬†¬† .
Thank you for the debate.
¬†¬† Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I believe he was right.
The action plan addresses these too.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I welcome this action plan.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .
These fears are not without foundation.



What, then, is missing?
What is sadly missing is a timetable.
That is the right order.

Then there are the risks.
¬†¬† .
I shall take them one by one.
Let me now turn to funding.
However, there is more than that.
That has to be clearly underlined.
¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
So much for the context.



Let us not mince our words.
¬†¬† .
A strong EU makes for a strong DAC.
I congratulate him.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
I doubt it.

¬†¬† The debate is closed.
He does not belong in this House.
¬†¬† The next item is voting time.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† That concludes voting time.
¬†¬† .
There are a number of reasons for this.
That is completely unacceptable.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
This procedure is considered fair.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
About time too!
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Hence our vote against.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Far from it, in fact.
We therefore voted against the report.
¬†¬† .

¬†¬† .

¬†¬† The debate is closed.
¬†¬† .
I must repeat that we need to keep up.
That is why I want to pursue both.
What, then, is left for us to do?
Nor is the EPLA more expensive.
There is no alternative.
Let me explain myself a little more.
We do not need that.
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
¬†¬† .
Now, quite rightly, they expect action.
And I agree.
Currently, we are at a standstill.
There no perfect solution.
I would like to make one final point.
The debate is closed.

Agenda
- Wednesday:
(Applause)
Does anybody wish to speak?

That is something that has to be said.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Mr Kelam, do you wish to add anything?
I am satisfied that has been done.
We need to react immediately.
(Loud applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Kelam.
I believe that it is clear.
I request that we take a vote.
(Applause)
The subject is closed.
(The order of business was adopted)
But what should we do next?
(Applause)

I do not believe that they have been.
Not every avenue has been closed off.
(Applause)
Try to starve them even more?
That would be downright disgraceful.
(Applause)


And what was the background to that?

You have jumped the queue of speakers.
Some of us have been to North Korea.
That must be said.
I quite agree with that.
That concludes this item.
However, it is more than that.
Size matters on this issue.
Until now, we had nothing in Europe.
We need a truly European energy policy.
They need European solutions.
National solutions will not be enough.

(Applause)
(Applause)
Let us also be frank about this.
Security matters are not enough.
Let me give you a final thought.
A week ago I was in Darfur.
(Applause)
There are numerous examples of this.
(Applause)
Lynch law is the order of the day.
They need our market for oil and gas.
We are their biggest customer.
That is going on day in and day out.
(Applause)
And why do we need Vladimir Putin?


What makes you do these things?
So that is all right, then.
That is our attitude.
(Applause)
All for the sake of 'clarification'.
I turn now to the Finnish Presidency.
I love Finland.
Shame on you!
The penalties cannot be tough enough.
(Applause)
Back to Russia, though.
Why did she write?
Do you know when she wrote that text?
How does Mr Putin respond?
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is madness.
(Applause)
This has come about through hard work.
Come, follow us!
They are Finland's priorities too.
Everyone knew about the death threats.
This is how important it is.
(Applause)
We have been here before haven't we?
(Applause)
What action shall we now take?
This is extremely important.
And that means an economic strategy.
(Applause)
Let us support her after her death.
We must be uncompromising.
We owe it to the murdered journalist.
Thank you.
Let me just mention the EIT.
It is amazing!
Something is wrong.
The status quo is not an option.
We cannot go on with business as usual.
I know we have excellent universities.
Universities were created in Europe.
We need a European dimension.
Therefore, the idea is network-based.
My final point concerns coherence.
We are, in fact, leading in the world.
That concludes the debate.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Use of passenger data (PNR) (debate)
This is vitally important.
We have other good news for airlines.
Well, congratulations!
Could somebody please reply to that?
(Applause)
There is nothing formal about that.
This should really make us think.
Why?
It is not a perfect agreement.
The choice is ours.
Congratulations, Commissioner!
Well done.
Now what on earth does 'deemed' mean?
This is not theoretical.
Vice-President of the Commission.
That is definitely not the case.
This is nothing new.
The debate is closed.
This is not in itself a novel approach.
Secondly, the absence of the Council.
Clearly not.
(The President cut off the speaker)
They are not that, however.
On the contrary.
The situation in Poland is similar.
Still, better late than never.
If not, what will the EU do?
That is simply not how things work.

(The President cut off the speaker)
In fact, the opposite is true.
That is a competence of the Union.
How would one define it?
Thank you very much.
How arbitrary of them!
Who, though, stands to benefit?
Thank you, your remarks are noted.
That concludes the debate.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Thousands of jobs have been lost.
I am sure that he will do so.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Member of the Commission.
One-minute speeches (Rule 144)
Europe cannot remain silent about this.
We have a lot to do.
Georgians, not Chechens.
Nothing was done about it.
(The President cut off the speaker)
There is no general crisis in Budapest.
To whom is this debit owed?
(The President cut off the speaker.)
However, this is still not enough.
This line of thought is unreasonable.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you very much, Mr Lundgren.
Have you read it?
He demanded an explanation.
This raises two important issues.
These include above all cooking apples.
That concludes this item.
There are 14 amendments.
That is something that animals deserve.
Thank you very much.


That is the purpose of this report.
It cannot continue to ignore them.
Who is going to pay for it?
The taxpayers.
I just wanted to get that off my chest.


The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
I welcome this debate.
This rationalisation is welcomed.


There are contrasting opinions on this.

That is the problem that we face.
It makes sense.
Let us take a recent example.
This is hypocrisy on a colossal scale.
Allow me to give you a few examples.
I think we have to be very careful.
(Applause)
Parkinson's law rides again.
We have no mechanisms for that.
Is that what you said?
That goes against common sense.
That is not true.
I believe it is worth it.
Why do we need an agency?
What is the Council of Europe's role?

I see Schengen as a romantic concept.


That is true, but why?
For many reasons.
I will mention just a few.
Did it stop them in London?
Consequently, we are helping them.
What do we gain?
And now we want a second generation.
What are we offering our citizens?
And this is supposed not to worry us.
Are we deluding ourselves?

Men need specialist services too.
So they need screening.
Too many men cannot cope.
That is our fault.
We do not enable them to cope; we must.
That too is unacceptable.
We need to do something about this.
Shame on all of us!
We cannot leave it at that, though.
This must change.

Welcome
(Applause)
In this debate we shall examine
First is the general outlook.

Otherwise it is unclear to citizens.


(Applause)
The 2007 budget is a package.
In general we are positive.

We will vote on this in December.

I ask the Commission to justify this.
I thank them for their hard work.
You do not build half a bridge.
It is a question of 'either/or'.
In fact, it does not.
The citizens pay.
It is a terrible shame.

No.
Clearly, this is inconsistent.

What do we have to do instead?
We are strongly opposed to all that.
My second remark will be brief.
The draft budget is moderate.
Nevertheless, it has clear priorities.
They call it social dialogue.
That is why it should be rejected.
That is what she said in committee.
Of course, the opposite is the case.



A game is being played here.
We rejected that proposal.


With EUR 425 million less?
By reducing the CFSP by 50%?

Annex - Commission statement
(Applause)
Member of the Commission.
Europe is there for its citizens.
Otherwise the EU has no raison d'√™tre.
This damages the Union's image.
We have seen all this before.
It comes from the bottom up.
This citizenship programme is top-down.
I was born a British citizen.
I never asked to be a European citizen.
Member of the Commission.

Vice-President of the Commission.

This is entirely logical.
Chromium plating is the other big area.
Its use must therefore be restricted.
Good work, Carl!
I would like to finish where I began.
We have to look at this very carefully.
The debate is closed.
Two wrongs never make a right.
Member of the Commission.
And we should certainly be vigilant.
On the contrary, it underpins that.
These efforts seem to bear fruit.
Such cases have risen alarmingly.
What is to be done, therefore?
We are against protectionism.
That is what I call 'moral'.
Mr Kamall made a similar point.
I agree with that.
The debate is closed.

President of the Commission.
That is precisely what we did at Lahti.
We need a European policy on migration.
(Applause)
Finally, Darfur was also discussed.
We will not be diverted from this path.
We must continue to respond.
(Applause)
Things turned out differently, however.
Hardly anyone expected him to either.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
That much is completely obvious.
It all sounded so wonderful.
Excellent!
Superb!
Superb!
Onwards, ever onwards!
So much for the announcements.
Outstanding!
(Applause)
All that is true.
This speech is not new either.
(Applause)
What was on the menu at Lahti?
(Applause)
(Applause)
I congratulate Prime Minister Vanhanen.
Congratulations.
The man is a gangster.
Wind farms are absurd.
I do not know.
It might.
Enough is enough.
The European Union must unite.
Here, there must be reciprocity.
It deserves our full support.
(Applause)
Our goal is partnership.
(Applause)
This is therefore a clear opening.
I hope Mr Putin was listening.
Europe is an economic giant.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The second issue concerns Cyprus.
Thirdly, there is innovation policy.
Thank you.
Why are we picking on Russia?
Why?
What quarrel do we have with them?
So why pick on Russia?
What do we have to divide?
That is tit for tat.
We need to understand that.
The EU-Russian dialogue is important.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you.
They are ill-treated.
Some have suffered physical assaults.
It had to be done.
Security of supply is a high priority.
What results?
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is his duty.
That is as I would expect.
Purchased it will be.
(Applause)
President-in-Office of the Council.
That is how I also feel.
We are dependent on one another.
This is a clear Union aim and policy.
(Applause)
It now remains to implement it.
Indeed it is.

This is an important step.
President-in-Office of the Council.
The ball is now in their court.
Thank you for putting it on the agenda.
With no dialogue, we have no influence.
Signature is a process.
This ignorance does us no favours.
Will this agreement promote democracy?
No one has answered that question.
Iran's intermediary is Syria.
That is the strategy.
This is not a matter of appeasement.
That appears to me to be a first step.

Mr President, you are welcome to come.
What is going on with the euro?
This is certainly an important issue.
We can no longer look on passively.
We need to do something about that.
The whole affair is an outrage!
That concludes this item.
Member of the Commission.
What does that mean?
Thirdly, there is transparency.
So, then, where do we stand?
The new Member States are doing this.
But is that really the case?
Can we not look at all this?
Can we not address all this?
There is plenty to discuss.
Member of the Commission.
We also need to strengthen dialogue.
President of Eurogroup.
I welcome that decision.
The debate is closed.
The next items on the agenda are
Member of the Commission.
The marine environment is under threat.
That is very necessary.
We need more overall joint action.
I think this sum is inadequate.
Secondly, we need coordinated actions.
The Baltic Sea is seriously ill.
It is above all a political one.
That is just plain absurd.
Do we want to look ridiculous?
The North Sea is not the Mediterranean.
The message was plain.
The mind boggles.
We must have a high level of ambition.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Its time has come.


Member of the Commission.
Nor would it be realistic.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
Member of the Commission.
We still do not know why it happened.
To a failure to comply with procedures?
To a network fault?
To a shortage of investment?
What can this breakdown teach us?
I believe they do a pretty good job.
Member of the Commission.
We really need to know why it happened.
I thank you for the debate.
The debate is closed.
Milk quotas (debate)
Member of the Commission.
That is important.
This is interfering with the market.
Milk production is capital-intensive.
The investment needed is massive.
Milk production is subject to quotas.
What I question is the timing.
We may soon become net importers.
There is a downside to all of this.
It makes no sense.
It does not make sense.
We need to bear that in mind.
Member of the Commission.
That is important.
They will be worth absolutely nothing!
The debate is closed.
- C6-0237/2006 -
- C6-0235/2006 -
Member of the Commission.
I do not share that view.
The Commissioner has confirmed as much.
We all want to strengthen rural areas.
What are the consequences of this?
I do believe that it does.

That is what I call improper.

What are we in this House to do?
That is the reason for our concern.
It is all too much, too soon.
This is hypocrisy.
We all know that.
Even the dogs in the street know that.
This was something that was agreed.
I can take no blame for this.
It must not be accepted.
We need a much longer-term solution.
Instead, what has been done?
This is a way of compensating them.
This is a complete mess.
So what do you do?
No one.
So look to us for help.
It cannot possibly go forward.
Of course this proposal distorts.

Member of the Commission.
That concludes the joint debate.
The vote will be tomorrow.

Decision on urgent procedure

Thank you for your kind attention.
Vice-President of the Commission.
Thus the rate of fraud is marginal.
It clearly does not.
It tests compliance with the rules.
Absolutely not.
You may think this sounds too radical.
We are proud of this achievement.
The Commission regrets this.
Thank you for your attention.
This is new.
What do we see now, though?
Greece does not.
What have you done to counter this?
What does the report tell us?
We cannot go on like this.
We do have rules.
We have a system.
Vice-President of the Commission.
Vice-President of the Commission.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Who is to blame for this?
The same goes for the environment.

Do we know?
We need to determine this space.
This is all stupid and ridiculous.
This is what I wanted to say.
The debate is closed.



Mercury is extremely toxic.
I ask the PPE-DE Group to think again.
The debate is therefore closed.
Mortgage credit (debate)

This is a translation)
We are an ancient European nation.
It is the only way forward.
This is a big change.
I wish to comment on some highlights.
This is a matter of national interest.
I do not say this lightly.
This year we built 340.
That is a lot for a small country.
It is an amazing story.
(Applause)
They re-established the hospital.
We helped them and carried out repairs.
It is not so far away as people think.
I am only quoting.
But in fact it is true!
(Laughter)
(Applause)
That again was taken away from us.
What were the circumstances?
(Applause)
(Applause)
We will never forget your solidarity.
This is shameful.
Wake up!'
What courage and determination.
I know what they are feeling.
It is all happening again.
This time let us not be silent.
Today we do not need retribution.
Nothing could be more misleading.
Not a weakness, but a strength.
Unfortunately this is not so.
The same will apply to Georgia.
We are ready.
The time has come to build confidence.
Together, we can achieve it.

Precious little.

By whom has it been recognised?
Parliament is awaiting a proposal.
I welcome that.
Get your act together please.
That is precisely what is needed.
We have not received one.
That is good.
(Applause)
What, therefore, is the issue for 2007?
Our group does not accept such a thing.
That will not do.
I cannot share your optimism.
We cannot live like this.
The schemers should be penalised.
(Applause)
- Internal affairs
Thank you.
None of this is in the work programme.

So have they been doing nothing?
Drinking coffee?
(DE) We have done so.
We still have a long list of proposals.
Delivery is fundamental.
We have European citizens' initiatives.
These are important tasks for 2007.
Foreign Affairs
A few points have been raised.
Mr President, how is 2006 ending?
What is our foreign policy?
We saw it in Finland the other day.
That is the reality.
That is our policy.
When there have been a billion deaths?
So what is Europe?
What are our relations with China?
Do we know?
Are they hostile? Are they friendly?
How do we address this factor?
A Sino-Russian axis is developing.
What will we be?
Let us draw up our own policy.
We cannot see it anywhere.
We cannot see Europe's policy anywhere.
(Applause)
Why not go for a Green Card initiative?
It means working with public documents.
Africa is going downhill.
2007 should be the year of the U-turn.

There have always been migrations.
I am sorry to have to point that out.

Let us look to the future.
Our work is not yet done.
This is about Europe, China and India.
That warning has served its purpose.
I wish it a lot of success in both.
I should like to make two comments.
My group is less enthusiastic.
It is about free markets.
It is going to be good for business.
It bears its hallmark.
I partially agree with this.
Today it is stagnant.
However, this one does not yet do that.
I very much welcome this directive.
That is a good compromise.

We are legislators, not governments.
Long may this continue.
(Applause from the right)
The failure follows a familiar pattern.
(The President cut off the speaker)

That is a fact.
Are there any causes for concern?
We should be pleased with this outcome.
For two reasons, I would say.
What happens, however?
(Applause from the right)
Sad, but true.
We must ensure feedback.
Perhaps they should get married!
Why hope?
It is a first step, and not the last.
The work in this area continues, then.
(Applause)
I do not share this concern.
Finally, two points.
I want to acknowledge that as well.
So I thank you for that.

I would like to thank you all.
I eagerly await the forthcoming vote.

Situation in Gaza (debate)
President-in-Office of the Council.
Vice-President of the Commission.
(Applause)
(Applause)
This has to stop.
(Applause)
What do we expect from terrorists?
The answer is 'none'.
They are not suitable partners for us.
(Applause)
That is unacceptable.
That is unacceptable.
(Applause)
Dialogue is the only way.
(Applause)
The time is over.
We cannot wait any longer.
How many enemies do the Israelis want?
(Applause)
How has that happened?
What happened on 15 November 1988?
(The President cut off the speaker)
(Applause)
Dialogue is the only way forward.
We must all strive to build confidence.
Have you been in contact with him yet?
(Applause)
Wherein lies the disproportion?

Gaza is a prison without hope.
All we do is to keep talking.
No side can win unilaterally.


We all know where the solution lies.
This is our responsibility.
The debate is closed.

Vice-president of the Commission.
The debate is closed.
President-in-Office of the Council.
We need to understand this.
You need to tell us something.
Months have gone past.
We cannot proceed in this fashion.
So, I have a question.
Is it an armed unit?
If so, under whose control?
Based where?
President-in-Office of the Council.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
President-in-Office of the Council.
Vice-president of the Commission.
Things cannot carry on like this.
President-in-Office of the Council.
Vice-President of the Commission.
We are open to exploring that option.
I would like to set three questions.
And thirdly, what do we actually want?
The report has three aims.
One: to support the Northern Dimension.
But basically it is an EU sea.
The average depth is 58 metres.
It was clear.
You could see the seaweed.
It was a wonderful place to swim in.
Green gunk!
It is really nasty.
It is in really bad shape.
Oxygen levels are very low.
You can see virtually nothing at all.
It is time to react.
58 metres average depth!
We see green and nasty.
Something needs to be done.
It deals with culture and security.
It is as simple as that.
We need to work on infrastructure.
Finns know the problems with that.
One: a Commission initiative.
Four amendments have been tabled.
(Applause)
President-in-Office of the Council.
Vice-President of the Commission.
(Applause)
Poland is right at the main crossroads.
(Applause)
Next year is International Polar Year.
(Applause)
We would all benefit from this.
Why indeed do we need this strategy?
(The President cut off the speaker)
What exactly are they doing there?
This debate never took place.
Vice-President of the Commission.
Let me also comment on the budget.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statement (Rule 142)
Vice-President of the Commission.

Europol is covered by the ESDP.
The enemy is the people.
Yet this report is limited in scope.
NATO is not supposed to be defeated.
I should like to make five points.
First point: I support the report.
I think it is excellent.
I think it is excellent.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Succession and wills (debate)

It really is welcome.
It touches matters of taxation law.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
I now turn to the situation in Europe.


Vice-President of the Commission.
Men still make most of the decisions.
Let us be honest.

Would Europe not be different, too?
Congratulations, Mrs Gomes.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
There are, however, new developments.
What is the situation so far?
That is the real situation.
They have no rights.
Their accommodation is tied.
First, we have to identify the enemy.
It is organised crime.
We are talking commodities.
We are talking merchandise.
Or your own wife?
It is not a recent phenomenon.
That is a good beginning.
It is time to change attitudes.
They also need to be complied with.
They will be too traumatised to do so.
Too little attention is given to this.
What should we do first?
The debate is closed.

Ombudsman.
I closed 312 inquiries during the year.
Thank you for your attention.
(Applause)


For that I ask your understanding.




Vice-President of the Commission.
It is clear, concise and to the point.
(Applause)
That is what we should be all about.
Thank you again for your report.
He has attended over 170 meetings.
In that case, who did?
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Schwab.
(Applause)
He should continue to do that.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Ombudsman.
I apologise, Mr President.
That is clearly not for us to do.
That is a fundamental difference.
I hope that will be done.
(Applause)

Written statement (Rule 142)
European communication policy (debate)
Why is that?
I propose that we accept it.
There is not.
Or if there is, tell me what it is.
Let us negotiate.
Let us talk about it.
Let us try to take advantage of it.
This is not an ideological issue.
I would earnestly beg you.
This is not an ideological issue.
It is a political issue.
One of timing.
I would earnestly beg you.
Vice-President of the Commission.
People switch off.
We do not.
No, we do not.
Finally, let me grab four seconds.
It is not in this report.


That would raise Europe's stock.

If they did, I heard nothing of it.
That is what communication is about.


May I offer you some advice?
You are in a hole of your own making.
Why?
Simply shouting louder will not do!
This is putting it mildly.


We have added GMOs to that.


Vice-President of the Commission.
We established five areas of action.
We need to empower citizens.
The debate is also shaped elsewhere.
They did not use the internet enough.
That will not do.
Well, we have a participatory deficit.
We have to make it a two-way process.
That is also part of our policy.
Are these the right areas?
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

Famagusta/Varosha (debate)
Member of the Commission.
Thirty-two years is too long.
It is a ghost town.
However, the issue is very simple.
It was a city of enviable beauty.
How simple-minded they were.
Nobody lives there.
It hosted a bustling port.
Obviously something must be done.
We know what a powerful country it is.
I abstained in the latest vote.
I can see no good in this situation.


(Applause)
I would like to highlight three points.
Member of the Commission.
I fully agree.
The debate is closed.

The omens are not good.
However, let us be positive.
Member of the Commission.

Debate on the future of Europe (debate)
(Applause)
Taoiseach,
You have the floor.
(Applause)
Prime Minister of Ireland.
I also wish your successor well.
Some key facts stand out.
Both of these tracks are essential.
There is, of course, no easy answer.
We need its principles and its values.
More people are in work.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Taoiseach Ahern.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Thank you for your time, Mr Poettering.
(Applause)
(Applause)
As a result, many vote with their feet.
(Applause)
One wonders!
(Laughter)
I support you.
We accept that and we can move forward.
I accept that point.
However, neither have we gone back.
That is why we negotiated a treaty.
It is when they work together.
Look at the equality agenda.
Look at the health and safety agenda.
Look at the welfare agenda.
Look at the mobility of workers.
Not a hope in hell!
Europe has achieved this.
I think these are great issues.
I am delighted to see Mr Allister here.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
Various Members will now speak.
(GA) Thank you all very much.
The Constitution must not be filleted.
(Applause)
What do we hear from the governments?
That is what the public demand to know.
That is what the public want to know.
It is a matter of substance.
Thank you very much.
They are flexible.
That is the truth.
Is there any reaction?
We need to decide.
Apparently we have no energy.
Come and get it.
The Commission rejects it.
Well, has the penny dropped yet?
Europe needs to move on.
I have called consistently for reforms.
We must have economic reforms.
(Applause)
They have not gone away.
That is an important message for us.
Prime Minister of Ireland.
I think it is an equitable document.
Of course it is made up of compromises.
Things change.
They worked very hard.
That is not an impossible task.
I think that is possible.
We should try to deal with that.
I really believe it is possible.
(Applause)

Written statements (Rule 142)
Member of the Commission.
That much is clear.
That is not what I have been hearing.
What has changed?
We have instruments available to us.
(Applause)
What emerged from these talks?
(Applause)
That is our responsibility.
They should be called to account.
No, it is shameful.

Member of the Commission.
The debate is closed.
Written statement (Rule 142)
President-in-Office of the Council.

There is, however, a deficiency.
These are the challenges of today.
I regard this as a great puzzle.
It has not been an easy achievement.
We now have our instrument.
Both are important.

President-in-Office of the Council.

Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be in December.
Written statements (Rule 142)
It is mere supposition.
Awareness-raising is the first step.
They thus use Turkey as a scapegoat.
They are right!
Member of the Commission.

(Applause)
President-in-Office of the Council.
This was very important to Parliament.
Thank you all.
SMEs are another priority.
That is a crucial point.
We cannot do anything about that.
This is a balanced agreement.
(Applause)





(Applause)
(Applause)
There has been no such time limit.
Commissioner, you are one of these men.
It will be a disaster for this planet.
We have a deal on three issues.
We have to move towards that.
Finally, ITER is the bad decision.
Why?

It is not a serious proposal.
I refer to what Mr Turmes said earlier.
I am winding down.
Many of you mentioned funding.
It is a major thing for Europe.
We have to go beyond that.
I have three major reasons for that.
Also, the others will understand them.
We cannot settle them alone.
Why?
(Applause)
The debate is closed.

We can do better in that area.
We have worked very closely on this.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
Written statements (Rule 142)

It is also easy to explain why.
There are always elections somewhere.
This cost is utterly prohibitive.
We might be said to be 50 years behind.

Essentially I agree with her.
This is a welcome and concrete step.
Thank you.

(The President cut off the speaker)
Europe is not absent from that region.
That is totally unacceptable and wrong.
That was all lacking in his case.
Are you still in any doubt, Mrs Doyle?
Mr President, I seek your assistance.
This goes against WTO principles.
The other nations should do the same.
Both of these are wrong.
This is the truth.
This is unacceptable.
Mr A≈ü√ßƒ± is now very near to death.
It must not be sidelined.
That concludes this item.
The next item is the joint debate on
Have we actually got to the top?
I really think we have.
We have come a long way since then.
How useful are these amendments?
Where will they take us?

Even so, we have got this far.

(Applause)
President-in-Office of the Council.
(Applause)
Member of the Commission.
Others give us a different account.


What are we talking about?
Many describe it as a monster.
Of course, it is not one.
All these things are good.
So what is not good?

That will involve money.
We in this House must do likewise.
We are on the right track.
I have high hopes for REACH.
There are a lot of imponderables.
Only time will tell.
I am not ecstatic about the result.
That is astonishing!
One last comment worth thinking about.
The REACH legislation is too ambitious.
We will be better informed.
What comes next?
Now we have a good one.
I am disappointed on three counts.
One final point on animal welfare.
I do not know.
Why?
Let me give some concrete examples.
I am very pleased about that.
I shall check that they do.
It is not a perfect compromise.
That is what this legislation will do.
REACH will be workable.
I find this utterly astonishing.
REACH is a sham, therefore.
That is unacceptable.
It has been a long marathon.
We have made progress.
It will soon be Christmas.
It achieved at least 90% of its goals.
It has changed REACH completely.
Congratulations Commissioner Verheugen.
You managed to kill REACH.
Average life expectancy has gone up.
That is how things stand.
REACH is a gift to our competitors.
This is progress for producers.
That situation will change next year.
It is true.
And it does not.
That is the challenge facing us.
This is a case in point.
Mr President, well, we are at it again.
You cannot obtain everything you want.
Thank you to all concerned.
The public needs to know that.
Two: we can reject the entire proposal.
The answer is a resounding yes.
No, it has not.
I wish to make only two further points.
My congratulations.
That is not true.
I shall eat it tomorrow.

(The President cut off the speaker)
I remember the Liverpool conference.
I wish to thank Mrs Hieronymi.
I have two reservations to express.
Product placement is banned.
That is the first thing to say.
Certain extremes remain.


Prohibition did not stop it in the USA.
It will not work.
I have time here for one example.
It is justifiably unhappy.
Moderate Members will support this.
If it keeps moving, regulate it.
And if it stops moving, subsidise it.'
This is the right way forward.
One was the extension of scope.

A television without frontiers.
That is absurd.

Nevertheless, I have two comments.


They are going to embarrass us.
President-in-Office of the Council.
Member of the Commission.
We have battled for that.
Many of us believe that that is right.
All but one are outside the EU.
They are not represented in the UN.

The second principle is responsibility.
The fourth principle is effectiveness.
I understand them.
I broadly welcome this regulation.






A host of improvements were made.
We have other aid for those purposes.

The other issue is connected with this.



This is not a criticism.
We support that idea too.

Member of the Commission.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow.

What does that mean?

Member of the Commission.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
This will reinforce Parliament's role.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The next privilege is immunity.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is a Parliament not a studio.
(The speaker spoke Irish)
Member of the Commission.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
This shocking figure must be minimised.
This is also important for consumers.
We looked at the following issues.
Thank you for your kind remarks.
Actually, I drive an Audi Quattro.
This is an important step.
The question is: why does this happen?
But they could!
This we have done.
I get around on foot or by train.
Let us not get carried away here.
This is a very serious issue.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.

Of course the answer is no.
We have always had it.
I shall finish with this.
(Applause)
Nor should it ever become one.
(Applause)
(Applause)
There is no doubt about that.
Mr Stubb's report stresses that fact.



(Applause)
(Laughter)
Allow me to single out two elements.
What size European Union do they want?
What is our vision?
Our vision is common.
This is incorrect.
We also need traffic lights.
What is Europe?
Where does Europe end?
But will that be Europe?
Today Turkey is not coming into Europe.
It is the work of the occupying army.
But here we turn a blind eye.
We close our eyes.
Of course not.
Why? Because Cyprus is a tiny country?
What is the European Union?
What does it want?
Who can be part of it?
But I am also against the Constitution.
It is not worth talking about.
Well, let us get down to it!
That logic still applies.
All of that needs to be resolved.
This is a win-win situation.
Dear Colleagues, make no mistake.
I have the following comments to make:
Let us not deceive ourselves.
One could compare this with a house.
That is why it must continue.
The fourth point concerns Turkey.

(The President cut off the speaker)
I do not think that we can.
Let us not fool ourselves.
Now, it is essentially out of the way.
It knows how to get away with it!
Since then the matter has been on ice.
We must not forget this.

This is a very encouraging debate.

In other words the report seeks:
This will happen for two reasons.
This is how it should be interpreted.
This is reflected in the Brok report.
You are wrong.
in writing.
This is unacceptable.
I will therefore abstain.
Data protection (debate)
We face a common problem and threat.
We need all of this at EU level too.
Mr President, I am especially curious.
The debate is closed.
This problem cannot be ignored.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mrs Lehtom√§ki.
(Applause)
Welcome
(Applause)
Thank you for attending our sitting.
I will begin by mentioning innovation.
I want to explain why this is wrong.
Both sides need to play by the rules.
Thank you for your attention.
(Applause)


The cards are on the table.
What we have to do is easily described.

The cards are on the table.
(Applause)
Welcome
Welcome!
(Applause)

Secondly, there is climate policy.
Then there is the issue of immigration.
Did we supply those ships?
No, we did not.
We did set up Frontex, though.
Thank you very much, Mr Cohn-Bendit.
Welcome
(Applause)
Welcome, Mr Ghanem!
(The President cut off the speaker)
What has happened since then?
People are worried and insecure.
Yes, they do.
What is it about?
It is simple.
It will be better.
Patience is now needed.
The first is immigration policy.
It is a sign of the times.
He is right.
Why is that?
Some of us have given examples of this.
That is what we have set our sights on.
The ball is now in Mr Erdoƒüan's court.
This capacity is not inexhaustible.
The Treaty of Nice is just a patch-up.
The Union's budget is woeful.
There is room for doubt.
Europe now faces a serious test.
It should be a message.
Does that make Europe worse?
Does that make people feel threatened?
Of course not.
That is the situation.
Secondly, there is the energy issue.
Take heart!
We will have to wait and see.
We must move ahead with enlargement.
It is a code word for something else.
Firstly, enlargement.
The other issue is immigration.
That is unfortunately a long way away.
Second, the Constitution.
Finally, justice and home affairs.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
It hasn't.
Council Question Time
I have no supplementary question.
Family-friendly business plans exist.
The main target should be youth.
Subject: Lithuania's energy prospects
I would request a reply in writing.
This is what happens now too.
Question No 9 has been withdrawn.
Subject: Status of Kosovo
That concludes Question Time.
Driving licences (debate)
We achieved that, too.
We see an improvement in mobility.
Mr President, I do apologise.
This is much too long a period.
Europeans are on the move.
I go to your country, you come to mine.
(The President cut off the speaker)
He has already mentioned a few things.
We are making things safer.
This scandal will be put to an end.
We shall see.
Thank you for your work!
Dream on!
This has been the reason for the delay.
Let us respect it.
That is disproportionate.
What a pity!
This is not a matter of red tape.
The debate is closed.
This statement was extremely clear.
That is the purpose of this proposal.
I am therefore able to accept it.
The debate is closed.

Violent video games (debate)
Thank you, Mr Frattini.
The Commissioner mentioned this.
That is a real shame.
The debate is closed.
He is on his way there as I speak.
It is a very important consideration.
I ask for your forbearance.

Yes, there are two new Member States.
That much is true.
That is very sad.
I was not attacking him, specifically.

I doubt it.
I am afraid that day is a long way off.
I am grateful to the Commissioner.
We must keep the two in balance.
But there are opportunities.

That is the essence of my opinion.
We have seven points to make.

The question is, how do we do that?
There is no changing that.
Let us take that opportunity.
This is the way forward.
We also need more competition.
We only have this one planet.
What has been the outcome of this?
We cannot have that.
I would mention two matters.
The plans are on the table.
We also have a polonium scandal.
The Commission is going to be busy.
We cannot have that!
This would provide greater security.
This is good, but not enough.
This is not at all the point, however.
In fact, they are absolutely crucial.
This programme must be continued.
We need a general consensus in Europe.
I wish to pay tribute to her.
We need spirits like hers.

It was not enough, however.

Thank you very much, Mr Vanhanen.
Thank you all.
President of the Commission.
This should be our common goal.
(Applause)
We want both.
This has to be made clear.
(Applause)
Turkey is an important country.
We are partners and also friends.
Immigration has been mentioned.
(Sustained applause)
I shall list two positive points.

'At long last,' it has to be said.
The second concerns chemicals policy.
(Applause)
(Laughter and applause)

No, of course they will not.
In Britain it will not wash.

What a travesty!
Nobody else has a say.
Thank you very much, Mr Dillen.
I have three brief points to make.
(Applause)
They will move very quickly.
We have more steps to take.
Happy Christmas, Mr President.
They are all important issues.
(Applause)
I have two questions.
Make up your mind.
(Applause)
(ET) I would like to talk about Russia.
Absurd.
I wish the new president luck.
So I might say that this Presidency ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
You are a fluent Spanish speaker.
(Applause)


And so to the Constitutional Treaty.
He said that in Italy.
Mixed messages are going out.
Yes, it is over to the Germans.
A happy Christmas to everybody.
What more can we say.
I wish all of you a Merry Christmas.
Thank you very much, Mr Buzek.
My sincere thanks to everyone.
(Applause)
President of the Commission.
We should avoid two risks.
It is not.
There are some concerns.

We do not and should not control that.

I hope that matter can be solved.

The next item is the joint debate on:

President-in-Office of the Council.
In principle, this approach is correct.
I think I have got the message through.
(Applause)
It will save time and money.
This is our position.
I find this very satisfactory.
We expect a lot from that report.
The group is divided on this issue.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
That was a disaster.
These are real success stories.
That is certainly not true in the UK.
It is about EU control.
The same goes for passengers' rights.
Yet we have gone even further.
The future looks even more bleak.
These are the Commission's projections.
President-in-Office of the Council.
The debate is suspended.
It will resume at 9 p.m.
It is impossible.
We must open up the market now.
Of course we have to have safeguards.
This is not the case today.
(The President cut off the speaker)
One issue remains outstanding, however.
This is very, very difficult.
How can this be achieved?
A social Europe is on its way!
You ran a very good race.
This is a key priority.
The debate is closed.
Annex - Commission Position
It is therefore pointless to look back.
The reality is different, however.
I have some questions for you.
Since 2005, new concerns have arisen.
It is still a substantial sum.

I am very pleased indeed.
This is not news.
Thank you.
She obviously never met Mrs Thatcher!
Goodness, what do we do about that?
What kind of dignity is that?
Our party does not do it.
Do you leave the post unfilled?
I respected them all.
Is it unique?
It is unique of its kind.
This is far too low.
It really is very sad indeed.
I speak from experience.
The debate is closed.
It is the same with the environment.
Do you really think we are that stupid?
Why?
Unfortunately this was not successful.
I propose to highlight three of them.

So Minister, please get it sorted.
Industry exaggerates, it always does.
(Applause)
It is impossible even to contemplate.
That is why we were elected.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I shall mention only two.
The second task concerns energy policy.
This has to be prevented.
That also applies to transport.
(Applause)
A 20% cut is not world leadership.
The ministers have to follow through.
It is crucial.
(Applause)
Talk, however, is not enough.
This was also mentioned at Davos.



That is good.
Some people say 'let China pay'.
(Applause)
Œúember of the Commission.


The word 'target' was not mentioned.
It should be a similar system.
Nairobi was mentioned.
However, more work is necessary.
But it is very important!

New PNR agreement SWIFT (debate)
The next item is the debate on
Vice-President of the Commission.
However, it is up to you to decide.
It operates everywhere.
That remains a very prudent thing do.
I will talk firstly about PNR data.
I shall mention two of these.
I shall now turn to the SWIFT system.
Mr Coelho will address the PNR issue.
Thank you.

That has been said already.
It is now January 2007.
Where are we on this point?
Does it take place?

Who can have access to it?
With whom can they be shared?
Europe does not.
Let us hope it will do so.
We must bring this saga to an end.
Refusal to transfer data is not.
This is like a running theme.
That is the reality.
That is the reality.
I came in for the latter.
I do not deny that.
Let us begin with credibility.
None do.
If so, when will this be decided?
Yes or no?
We cannot resolve this overnight.
Tough negotiations are needed.
Where is the data?
Who has access to the data?
What for?
How many data and for how long?
I shall keep you up to date on this.
Can a solution be found?
The debate is closed.
We know the issue is sensitive.
Vice-President of the Commission.
The UK system uses both.

Or is that really the case?
Every time I come here I have to smile.
In 1992 I started a small business.
When ever?
After that it should stand well back.
How many of you have done that?
Well, I will tell you.
Compare that with these proposals.
And it works just fine.
This has been the case for many years.
I give you that commitment.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
We need to reflect.
The debate is open, and I welcome that.
China is of great concern.
He has not touched on that.
Essentially, the issues are the same.
I think we all share that.
It did nothing of the sort.


What is the problem?
Our companies have something to offer.
SMEs benefit from public procurement.
Mrs Mann asked to be kept informed.
As I have said, I do not agree.
I certainly agree.

Women in Turkey (debate)
There are 40 million women in Turkey.
This has got to stop.
It is not that they are not there.
I am hopeful for women in Turkey.
Member of the Commission.
This will include future projects.
The same applies to Turkey.
So let us not pretend to sermonise.
I am talking about the Turks in Cyprus.
We damn them either way.
This is absurd.
Congratulations!

The European Project is a success.
The two are interlinked.

So, the two are closely linked.
Europe has to take action.
The scale of the problem is huge.
We cannot put off decisions any longer.
Where, then, is Europe in all this?
Can we maintain the target?
We in Europe can learn from each other.

Thank you.
I would claim that it has done that.
That has changed.
Here, too, much has been achieved.
Secondly, we have to diversify.
Thank you.
Allow me to offer two examples.
It is a challenge that is double-sided.
We have to make it an opportunity.
Not one.
What does that leave?
Gas.
What are our relations with Russia?
Enough to relieve Europe.
What are they doing?
Now it is time for action.
The first one is on the Lisbon Agenda.
Social harmonisation is too weak.
It is an ambitious project for 2010.
Far from it, in fact.
What can the EU do?
Vice-President of the Commission.
I should like to make three comments.
The debate is closed.
It is at a dangerous turning point.
(Applause)
Member of the Commission.
I therefore welcome the report.
Let me, therefore, be completely clear.
It is no longer sustainable.
I think this is widely accepted.
I completely agree.
That is exactly the problem.
Wine is not exempt from this objective.
Why do we sell at different prices?
Our policies need to be reliable.
This we can rely on;
That is unacceptable.
What was the Commission thinking?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Cheers!'
Thank you for your attention.
That is unacceptable.
It contains many compromises.
Exactly.
Therefore, we need promotion.
I can only ask why.
I think this is crucial.

Situation in Darfur (debate)
Darfur is not a simple issue.

The Council is not present today.
Commissioner, thank you for being here.

Annual political strategy 2008 (debate)
Vice-President of the Commission.
Firstly, energy and climate change.
Now we must deliver.
I hope that this will be the case.
We are glad you are here.
We can argue about the details.
That is a sore point for me.
How true and how worthy of support!
Point the way, Commissioner!
We welcome that.
Your strategy is to supply results.
We think that is good.
We cannot see that.
There is no consensus for that either.
Why should that be?
All too often there is nothing precise.
Instead, it will make us all poorer.
Today is no different.
This is deception.
Firstly: energy.
Secondly: Lisbon.
Thirdly: multilingualism.
That happens year after year.

(Applause)
We need to be sensible.

We are far from achieving our dreams.
So maybe you should look at that.
Another inconsistency.
There is a distinct imbalance there.
Do not wait for the Council!
Commissioner, show more courage!
There are many challenges before us.
There are some Parliament ones too.
They need our help.
We are not designing yet.
We need a policy of prevention.
There is no second chance.
This is quite important for the UK.
On the contrary.
My last point is very important.
Yet transport is important.
I think it is an excellent document.
I know we have to administer it.
I know we have to go a little slower.
Vice-President of the Commission.
This must be the overall goal.
I think that this will help us a lot.
This means better regulation.

Childcare (debate)

Why is child care important, then?

I just wished to point this out.
What is the debate about?
It is important that we are honest.
Is this debate about children?
Is the debate about choice for women?
Why should Europe invest in childcare?
Why is this?
Do we not love children any more?
That is certainly not the case.
That is not what we are here to debate.

They do not have an aid element.
This time for island people.
In conclusion, let us stop interfering.
Leave successful islands alone.

There is no relationship.

I go each year to the Canary Islands.
We do not want too large an agency.
Member of the Commission.
He has made history!
On the contrary.

President-in-Office of the Council.
Member of the Commission.
New investment techniques have emerged.
Let me conclude.
EU financial markets are strong.
On this we are all agreed.
Who will be responsible?
Which country's legislation will apply?
Another question.
It should be inside the system.
Member of the Commission.
The debate is closed.
Allow me to highlight a few key points.
Diplomats we are not.
President-in-Office of the Council.
Member of the Commission.
Here too, the EU must work as one.
The situation is extremely problematic.
What could the future look like?
(The President cut off the speaker)
A just solution must be found.
That is why Serbia must not be ignored.
(PL) Thank you, Madam President.
I should like to protest against this.
Kosovo is also an exceptional case.
Member of the Commission.

Written statements (Rule 142)

Member of the Commission.
Certainly not.
That is not acceptable to me.

You have given us a number of answers.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
As you are aware, we now have a ruling.

Firstly, on labelling.
The issue of co-existence was raised.
This is crucial.

That concludes the debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.00.

Let us get something done about that.
I shall make three remarks quickly.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
Member of the Commission.
This is beyond dispute.
It is, however, so much more.
There is no two ways about it.
This is blindingly obvious.
That is the only solution.
I still had many things left to say.
What is this attributable to?
Something has to change here.
That is unsporting and unfair.
So much for British interests!
Such abuses are totally unacceptable.
That is absurd.
Football has a number of problems.
That is what is needed.
Football is synonymous with the UK.
In football, Europe is a superpower.
Violence was also discussed.
This is very important.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the joint debate on
We are addressing them.
Let us be clear.
I now come to the second proposal.
Our proposal falls within this context.
Well, today, there is legislation.
That cannot actually be the problem.
Thank you to the rapporteurs.
These seven proposals form a whole.
I am therefore unable to accept them.
I am very grateful to him.
Certainly!
I now come to Mr Savary's proposal.
We endorse them.
What tasks will it fulfil?

That amendment is in the package.
That is what we are here for.

It is a step forward, however.
This is a huge amount of money.
This is a huge amount of money.
A stock market can be fickle.
Everyone is in favour of this.
Surely this has to stop?
That is their democratic right.




Clearly, that does not seem sensible.
Let me say a few words on agencies.



We have two basic demands.
I cannot imagine this to be the case.
Why could this not be done?
Last year was an exception.
Let us, then, refuse to grant it.
Allow me to single out a few points.
We want clarification on that.
I agree with her.
Thank you.
How can we police our Community money?'
So what do we do about this?
I have three points to make.
The first is trust.
We need the markets to trust us.
Secondly, it is democracy.
We need the people to trust us.
Allow me to make a proposal.
We need two things in this report.
Where is the Council, Madam President?
I would insist, where is the Council?
So where is the Council?
Where is the Council, Mr Kallas?
Where is the Council?
I cannot put it any more directly.
The question is, how do we get there?
But of course it is!
But is concerns everybody.

Those agencies are an important issue.
There must be a workable solution.
It is going ahead.
In any case, something can be done.
Thank you, Mr Staes.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be noon today.
However, I could not agree on some.
Now, that is progress.
Well, it does not work like that.
It is a simple truth.
Unfortunately that has stopped.
We will be working on those issues.
For us it is a very high priority.
We must take prevention seriously.
With HIV, it takes a very long time.
Condoms do work.
Needle exchange does work.
And those who promote abstinence?
No.
She has no choice.




This must be done in several ways.
It could eventually kill you.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon

There is harmony in the home.
When there is harmony in the home,
There is order in the nation.
When there is order in the nation,
There is peace in the world.'

Create minds that innovate,
Why?
Go back to the many discoveries.
Discover the continent.
Venture into unexplored parts.
Create new highways.
In the minds of the best,
Hundreds of years of war and blood.
Tears flooded many nations,
Many engulfed in an ocean of sadness.
And peace bound the European Union.

Our policy must remain credible.
Those are the grim statistics.
This must be encouraged.
That is a very significant development.
We cannot remain silent.
No, ladies and gentlemen.
Let us call a spade a spade.
These are the facts.
Are there problems?
Of course there are.
Is the situation as it is described?
What is this plan?
To fund and buy out the opposition.
Many were arrested and tortured.
South Africa always plays a key role.

Why should there be Aid for Trade?
Trade is what makes the world go round.
The opposite is the case.
That much is abundantly obvious.

But we will keep talking.
Funding is important.
(PL) Thank you, Mr President.
We have huge economic power.
Reciprocity is unnecessary.

The experience was a good one.

We therefore voted against the report.

What will its duties be?
How will the Commission be formed?
And so forth.
We need to remember that.
Thank you.
Europe is making progress.


(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
They were proven wrong.
And the model?
They listen, but they do not hear.
(Applause)
This is also significant.
Fewer words and more action!
These questions are on the table.
What do you think about them?
This is a delusion.
(Applause)
People have said no.
Do not impose it upon them.
So was Mr Bayrou.

Prime Minister of Italy.
That is what happened!
What are we afraid of?
I ask no other questions.
(PL) Thank you, Mr President.
(Applause)
Do not harbour any illusions, though.
Nobody wants to offend China.
It is not a constitutional crisis.
Thank you, Mr Kirkhope.
We need a strong Europe.
Mr Schulz compared you to the Leopard.
True, we have misfired.
What will happen tomorrow morning?
We do not want to set up a super state.
We respect you.

Written Statements (Rule 142)

Situation in Palestine (debate)
Next week the Quartet will meet.

That is a positive step forward.
Is that really what we want?
They reject violence.

We seem to be paralysed by the roadmap.
Let us imagine a city with no police.
It responded with the mailed fist.
Yet again, we appear to be paralysed.
That cannot be a means to peace.
It is not enough!
We must act quickly!
In my view this is vital.
Why go into interminable details?
That would be some sort of progress.
That is all!

What does the Hamas Charter say?
How did the state of Israel come about?
What was the UN resolution at the time?
What was the basis for the partition?
We have to keep to them.
What are you really waiting for?
We should not.
Stop; think; talk.
(Applause)
The same can be said, too, of Lebanon.
I do not think it would.
I want you to understand these things.
But there are security concerns.
We are engaging.
Commission Question Time
Part One
It is a justified question.
You mentioned the example of maize.
There are two explanations for this.
Part Two



There are also some vertical issues.
So this is a turning point.


That would be the wrong reaction.
Have they now been set up?

But is there rule of law?
That is rather clear language.
That concludes Question Time.

Secondly, I am a Dutchman.

Dmitri was hospitalised at 12.51 a.m.
We have to show Estonia solidarity.

It does not surprise us.
We do not agree with Putin.

(Applause)
The Bronze Soldier was just a pretext.
Allow me, therefore, to explain.

It was the right decision.
It is that, of course.
There is more transparency.
There is no two ways about it.
No more, no less.
They want their voice heard in Europe.
Improvements are possible, though.
This is why we must be quite clear.
There is no power without support.
Expectations are running high.
Thank you very much.

Please let this be seen.
This is not the case at all.
This is what this is about.
I will say more about this in a moment.
It was one that I did not understand.
We cannot do without Europe.
Everyone says certain things.
What are our common motives?
What makes Europe this continent?
We cannot do without this debate.
What is actually the ideal situation?

This is also true of the Netherlands.
We need to find a solution for this.
This is what has made Europe strong.

Situation in Nigeria (debate)



The people were committed.
Our role is more of a structural one.

This cannot be the solution.
Any comment would be superfluous.

There is an alternative.
This can be achieved.
There are no contradictions.
This lesson has to be very effective.
Thank you.
Not at all.
At least, that is how it should be.
Now they are breaking their promise.
That is a fact.
Now, a conflict has erupted.
Is there a way out?

Can we not have clear answers?
That would be nice.

No, this is a European issue.
Action is needed now.

Thursday:
(Parliament adopted the motion)

(Applause)
(Uproar in the Chamber)
(Applause)
I have never seen that.
We shall therefore repeat the vote.
(Parliament adopted the motion)
(The agenda was therefore adopted)
This Regulation was necessary.
We shall keep an eye on this.
This had been a health problem.
That is a very important point.
That would be taking things too far.
There is no alternative compromise.
That is the reason for my request.
I look forward to the discussion.
That is not the aim of the legislation.
That brings me to the vodka compromise.
I think it is a good compromise.
Why?
We have also got to work with facts.
That is not true.
I can see surprise from some Members.
All those things have been met.
This too is very important to my mind.
It goes further than this though.
This is not just about the product.
They have a point, of course.
It has to have its own, distinct name.
We now move on to vodka.
Let us return to vodka, however.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
My question is: why?
Public health is genuinely threatened.
It is not desirable.
We politicians have other things to do.
Well, Mr Maaten, yes I have.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Of course they would not.
That would be tantamount to heresy.
Let us call a spade a spade.
My thanks once more to Mr Schnellhardt!
We should all support this tomorrow.
The opposite is the case.

I intend to return to that issue.
The vodka belt has three arguments.

Now we come to my surprise.
Thank you very much.
It is all perfectly clear like this.
I believe that this, too, will succeed.
This also goes for the raw material.
Why was the proposal rejected?
Why this talk of tradition?
Why is this the case?
We demand equal treatment.
I shall conclude on that note.
The debate is closed.

Cat and dog fur (debate)
Thank you, everyone.
Your protests have borne fruit.
We have progressed beyond that.
He has fulfilled his pledge.
If they knew they would not buy them.
When will there be a ban on seal fur?
They serve us and are devoted to us.
Sensitivity is universal.
This legislative proposal is unusual.
Allow me to make two or three points.
You have talked about 'a long time'.
I would just like to mention that.
I know your views.
That was our approach.
(Applause)

Membership of Parliament
May your work give you great pleasure.
Thank you very much, Mrs Doyle.
The next item is the joint debate on:
The Council is not present.
Those are just a few remarks.
We are seeing that aid really works.
(Applause)
This is not just about money, though.
Many women die unnecessarily from it.
Aid in this area is extremely urgent.
It is time for a new beginning.
A turning point, albeit an uphill one.
Let me list them for you briefly.
No binding commitments emerged.
They are self-appointed world leaders.
This is modern feudalism.
We are talking about Africa.
You would go to Germany or England.
We know how busy his schedule is.
It is happening in front of our eyes.
And what have we done?
We have abdicated leadership.
It is nonsense.
No Delors, no Kohl.
We have the ability to change this.
We must not accept these standards.
Thank you, Mr Mitchell.
Many thanks, Mrs Ibrisagic.
This is simply unacceptable.
I should like to make one last point.
Is this commitment really new?
We do not know.
Vital, says the G8.
Finally, aid must be rational.
The first is on climate change.
2015 is almost upon us.
It is urgent that we take action.
Let me begin with the G8.
That is one specific.
People differ, Mr Deva.
That, at least, is my point of view.
The joint debate is closed.
Is that a reason not to go there?
Member of the Commission.
It was once again a fruitful year.
This is a priority, rightly so.
Zimbabwe remains a thorny issue.
They can help us in that way.
We have discussed this at length.
There has already been some progress.
I say that in answer to Mrs Kinnock.
I am open to all your suggestions.
We have only just started.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
The next items are:
What have we done?
The Commission is unhappy.

Thank you, Mrs McCarthy.
Has the CFSP failed in this respect?
Why was that?
Our assent will be conditional on this.
The debate is closed.
We are calling for common sense.
It is really high time it did so.
That would be no bad thing.

We do not support those amendments.
I personally think not.
This is of course a natural occurrence.
Their understanding was crucial for me.
There are alternatives to mercury.

It is stable internally and externally.
None of this has happened by accident.
I will now turn to Cyprus and Malta.
This was also discussed on 3 May.
We support Malta's accession.
That is a fact.
Change is never easy.
Statistics confirm this.
You cannot feed a family on a McJob!
My thanks once again to Mr Langen.
We need to go beyond that, Mr Gloser.
This, however, applies to other fields.
This is not sustainable.
The timetables have been laid down.
Member of the Commission.
No foundation whatsoever.
That is a hypothesis.
That is desirable.
That is a fact.
They are different statistics.
At these times I do not see you.

Our emphasis must be on lifestyle.
We must invest in this sector.
Prevention is better than cure.
We need patients to be well informed.
However, we are very late in this.
I find that embarrassing.
This is why action is needed.
We must pool knowledge.
Perhaps next time.
Member of the Commission.
I should like to correct one mistake.
That is one of my main arguments.
It has to be viewed as such.

MON 863 - Risk Management (debate)

A study has also been made in Austria.
They contain statistical errors.
We need a reassessment.

Where are EFSA's studies?
Member of the Commission.
There is a procedure.
We have to get information.
It is assessed by EFSA.
So it was not something taken lightly.
It was not something that was ignored.
The debate is closed.
Vice-President of the Commission.
Why did you not mention this?
Well, how much clearer can it get?
I am not stupid.

We asked for that many times.
It is purely down to technical reasons.

Let us hope that this will not happen.
There is no more time to lose.
Mercury enters the food chain easily.

Is that how things should be?
That is genuinely embarrassing.
We used to play with it in the past.
Vice-President of the Commission.
There is no doubt at all.
The debate is closed.
Just to be absolutely clear.
Nobody will want double regulation.
What we need is greater security.
The question is simply how.
We suggest another way.
My group was no different.
We should not be na√Øve.
That is our responsibility.
The only defence is cooperation.

Posting of workers (debate)

Why not?
That is important for employees.

That is the direction we should take.

I take my hat off to you.
I regard this as unacceptable.
We need more money.
We need better systems.
There are also new issues to address.
My thanks to the Commission.
Change is needed.
Are we responsible for this sector?
Vice-President of the Commission.
It is a very difficult battle.
The debate is closed.
Member of the Commission.
So what is the EU looking for?
They have to produce real change.
Talk is not enough.
It is not enough to pass new laws.
Both sides have a great deal at stake.
That is a good thing.
This news has brought me great joy.
This is a huge issue at the moment.
I believe not.
Member of the Commission.
It was not unfair trade.
It is a win-win situation.
What are you going to do, Commissioner?

We achieved that objective in 1986.
I know, however, that we can do it.
The mandate, furthermore, is clear.
We have to move quickly.
(Applause)
We therefore need to be clear on this.
It is not to create a new mandate.
That is once again how it will be.
We think it is our duty to do so.
Doha is therefore an essential issue.
Africa and Europe must work together.
(Applause)
Thank you for your commitment.

It was a remarkable game.

So let us harness that enthusiasm.
I think that is worthy of note.

The image is apt.

We all agree with that.
Let us say so clearly.
Just one more point, Mr President.
(Over to you, Jos√©).
We wish you all the best.
I agree.
I wonder why he says nothing.
A year later, it is looming again.
I ask you: less federalist than what?
Stop your own fleet.
Please act!
We have other serious concerns.
We must not forget that.
Certain issues are striking.

The game will continue.

Thank you, Jan Marinus Wiersma.
This is extremely important for Europe.

We naturally want to fill those gaps.

That is how I see this issue.
I consider that the wrong option.
Two more comments.
Finally, I turn to immigration.
Thank you, Mr President.
That is what we have seen here today.
Europe has not been deadlocked.
Times are, therefore, better.

The next item is the joint debate on
This remains a concern of mine.
I refer later on to the Fed formula.
So be it.
There is no doubt about that.
The deficits are decreasing.
(Applause)
We must react to it.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Member of the Commission.
There is one very positive fact.

I believe that it is alive and kicking.
I shall digress no longer.
Agenda
(Parliament gave its assent.)
I am nearly done.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
One is the wage moderation issue.
Those are developments that we reject.
Let us seize this opportunity.
What then could one do with it in Riga?
Please take note of this.
Homework has to be done.
I want to make that clear to the left.
That is a mission impossible!
President of Eurogroup.
(Applause)
Secondly, the 2008 deficit ...
(Laughter)
(Applause)
My second point concerns jobs.
Figures are figures.
What are the figures?
Why are they so low?
So, the rules are clear.
It will not work.
Member of the Commission.
And I entirely agree.
Firmness does not mean rigidity.
I now come to my second consideration.
The debate is closed.
Palestine (debate)
Israel also has specific obligations.
That would be an enormous help.
We are identifying some funds for this.
Finally, a few words on Gaza.
Is it because we have a bad conscience?
What needs to be done?
That is a good starting point.
We must ensure that the EU BAM works.
They depend on agricultural exports.
We need a new Saint Francis of Assisi.
I do not know.
Member of the Commission.
Mr President, I will be really brief.
The debate is closed.
Situation in Pakistan (debate)
We intend to work on this basis.
Member of the Commission.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Future agreement on Kosovo (debate)
President-in-Office of the Council.
The status quo is not sustainable.
Member of the Commission.
We provide generous assistance.
We owe it to Kosovo.
What do we want?
This is not true.
There can be no peace without justice.
So far, everything is clear.
I thank you.
These must be spelled out.
President-in-Office of the Council.
We believe that this is a crucial step.
Member of the Commission.
I shall start with Serbia.
The debate is closed.
Written statement (Rule 142)
Delaying the question is not an option.
It is hard to disagree.
Macedonia is a candidate.
The rest are queuing.
This seems to be the case in Kosovo.
I think that we should too.
The next item is the debate on:
Doubts therefore remain on this issue.
Do we identify the same ones?
(Applause)
We would ask you to stop doing that.
President-in-Office of the Council.
Member of the Commission.
The expertise is there.
What, do you have a magic wand?
But how?
These regulations hinder production!
President-in-Office of the Council.

Is that enough?
Probably not.
Is the Commission ready to do more?

Is such a programme envisaged?
President-in-Office of the Council.
President-in-Office of the Council.
President-in-Office of the Council.
That concludes Question Time.
Member of the Commission.
We are not in competition.
We can work together.
We are in the same team.
If not, all this remains very vague.
Last year, we gave EUR 62 million.
I trust you will treat me well.
We know all of this already.
These should be the priority.
Member of the Commission.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the joint debate on
I believe all this is double-talk.
Member of the Commission.
Madam President, Members of Parliament.
Do we have such methods?
One more question of a social nature.
I hope that this is so.
Member of the Commission.
Well, I think so.
So I think that is settled.
I think this will be important.

I am sorry.
1.
I deeply regret that.
The situation in Iraq is desperate.
The statistics are horrifying.
This is what Iraq looks like today.
Today, they are denied this right.
Of course, there is not civil war.
It is worse.
There is total chaos.
They need our help.
Who has done this, though?
Who is responsible?
Who has spread chaos?
Is it Saddam Hussein?
Is it the Ba'ath Party?
What are we supposed to say?
The situation in Iraq is not improving.
The debate is closed.

Thank you.
My heart bleeds for them.
That has not happened.
One such enemy exists in Turkey.
That would be the prudent thing to do.
(Applause)
The situation is critical.
What are we actually here to do?
This must take place at local level.
I must reiterate that point.
They do exist.
We must also address the causes.
(Applause)
The government was caught unawares.
This must change.
Greece, a Member State, must do more.
The GNP loss may be calculated as 2%.
Who is guilty?
Who are those responsible?
What conclusions can we draw?
(Applause)
They need our solidarity.
What came of all this?
Absolutely nothing.
What about the 'Forest Focus' scheme?
Or is that not lucrative enough?
What about waste policy?
Almost 500 million?
There, the deadline is 12 hours.
It was truly invaluable.
Let us re-examine this matter.
What tools can it make available?
We have heard a great deal.
Let us hope they make the right choice!
This is absolutely crucial.
The capacity was simply exhausted.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
Written statements (Rule 142)
How are things at the moment?
They are moving in the right direction.
However, that is not enough.
We need a review, not bureaucracy.
Law is not soft, law is coercive.
What does this mean?
(Applause)
Since then, we have made good progress.
We want a Europe of results.
Further proposals will follow.
I fully endorse what Mr Doorn has said.
However, there are still deficits.
That is around 5.5% of the EU's GDP.
Thank you, Mr Helmer.
Soft law is a worry.
I must refute that very firmly.
I would like to make that very clear.
I am really quite surprised.
Let me try and clarify.
It would certainly be more expensive.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
This is very important.
What is the situation in Europe?
We also have many obstacles.
I have seen this in this work.
It looks to the future.
It will have three main objectives:

It still has a number of limitations.
How effective is EURES?
This amounts to very few indeed.
More commitment really is needed here.

Let me give a couple of examples.
Firstly, on e-procurement.
I have just quoted Jacques Delors.
(Applause)
It tackles important questions.
Mr Toubon, a crisis of confidence?
Oh yes, oh yes!
Why not?
This is a real life example.
(Aplauses)
Thank you, Mr Toubon.
An EU that can grow even stronger.
I would like to thank the rapporteur.
It is a very worthwhile suggestion.
Others will soon come.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
However, it is far from complete.
These are largely taken for granted.
That has not been the case at all!
The matter is closed.
That is very clearly a gap in the law.
The debate is closed.
Gdansk shipyard cannot be an exception.
That process is ongoing.

Here is where it began.
Shipbuilding is a global industry.
There are such people in this Chamber.
This must be taken into account.

What if it were to come true, though?
We need to insist on this.
I have one final point, Mr President.
(DE) The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
We had about five working meetings.
Why not talk to the Council about this?
That is, of course, a very good thing.
That is what I wanted to make clear.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Logistics are a major problem.
This is a good example to us all.
That is untrue.
Action is required.
That is the million-dollar question.
I believe that is the right approach.
(The President interrupts the speaker)
Congratulations to the rapporteur.
We have to act now.
Would we have fewer lorries?
Of course not.
The rules do need to be tidied up.
So will you look at the facts?
I await your conclusions with interest.
I shall simply make a few comments.
Finally, training.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Single European Sky (debate)
I shall answer each of the questions.
No.
But we need to move faster.
I am not sure.
Yet that may not be enough.
You can rely on our help.
Growth in air traffic is phenomenal.
I am ready to do all I can to respond.
The debate is now closed.
Written statement (Rule 142)

Commission Question Time
Is the Commission also prepared?
We are ready to do the same.
Germany did a very good job on this.

Thank you, Commissioner.
Madam President, I will be brief.
I will need to study the detail.
He mentioned the safeguard clause.
Recommendations are part of soft law.
Virtually nothing was spent on people.
If not, we do not succeed.
What about the Member States?
We have many models in Europe.
Subject: Equal opportunities
I am happy to do that.
This transition is possible.
Again, this is a related topic.
That is clear.
That concludes Question Time.
Membership of Parliament: see Minutes

Reducing alcohol-related harm (debate)

We should focus on young people.
These are important aspects.
The Member States are the main players.
The EU only has a supporting role.
And the resolution says as much.
We can and should do this.
The same applies to advertising bans.
Why is this so?
Alcohol is not a normal product.
This does not mean banning alcohol.
That is wrong.
There should be interpreting!
(The speaker continues in English.)
I gave proper notice.
I would like there to be interpreting.
(The speaker reverts to Irish.)
(GA) We need to exercise scrutiny.
(The speaker reverts to Irish.)
(The speaker continues in English.)
(Applause)
The figures speak for themselves.
In that way Estonia is killing Finns.
In Europe, we do not label.
Eighty per cent of Irish mothers drink.
I know mothers in Ireland.
It is time to break this cycle.
Why do men drink at work?
Colleagues have mentioned ADHD.
There is also Asperger's Syndrome.
The same applies to alcohol awareness.
Alcohol is dangerous.
The statistics vary widely.
This is important.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 142)
The next item is the joint debate on
Thank you for all your work.
Its main focus is milk quotas.
Rome was not built in a day, however.
A word on the quota.
This money must be devoted to two aims.
And we look forward to hearing that.
What is the situation within the EU?
What should be done?
I do not think so.
I would like to address a few points.
Milk is a valuable and healthy food.

Fight against terrorism (debate)
Does the House agree to this?
We see it every day, Commissioner.
What role are we playing?
What role do we want to play worldwide?
Do we have an underlying plan?
There is a lack of an underlying plan.
Freedom is achieved through rules.
Can the Council promise us this today?
Is the measure effective, though?
Are the measures proportionate?
Finally, necessity.
It is not a coordinating role.



Thank you very much for your attention.
(Applause)
The public is afraid. It is worried.
The public expects to be safe.
What is the European response?
I am disappointed.
Terrorism has not been defeated.
We need a fresh start.
Poverty can also be a motive.
We would support a European FBI.
(Applause)
We need answers on this score, too.
It is good to take a look back.

We need to seek direction.
How many cases have there been?
Why not look at that?
The fundamental problems remain.
But are we doing so?
We need a clear answer.
What is the negotiators' mandate?
Why?
To fight terrorism.
Why?
To fight terrorism.
We bring back torture.

HMG's view:
We abstained on the resolution.
A word to the wise...
What was bound to happen has happened.
There is a shortage of butter.
Prices are rising.
Contagion, however, is an issue.
What can Europe learn from this crisis?
That is the way markets go.
Financial markets function on risk.
How robust was their methodology?
Where was it?
Were the European banks more gullible?
(Applause)
This is a great challenge for us all.
This is today's reality.

I have four questions for Mr McCreevy.
Because that is impossible today.
(Applause)

Could it have been avoided?

Frontex coordinates those activities.
What is the situation in Portugal?
I hope he gets a successful package.
If so, why do you not say so clearly?
If not, what are the reasons?
Who has made you so reticent?
That was a first initiative.
Thank you for your reply.
Quite honestly, that is a non-answer.
Thank you very much.
That concludes Question Time.
This is quite interesting.
No way!
It is anything but angelic.
That is most regrettable.
That is my case.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Our own House must be cleaned.
What d√©marches?
There is just embarrassed silence.
Right on! Let us cheer!
Silly young Czechs!
What are human rights in Russia?
I would go further.
In doing so, we should be pragmatic.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 142)

I am aware that there are concerns too.
I agree with you.
Apparently, we need more analysis.
When is something going to get done?
May I say two things?
Fish are dying!
That is entirely unsustainable!
That is the thrust of my amendment.
This is where the real debate begins.
With fisheries policy it is different.

Review of the consumer acquis (debate)
However, what method should be used?
This will take place in October.
It is accepted.
People know what it is about.
A holistic view is therefore essential.
I am very grateful for that.
What does the approach taken here mean?
This law must naturally be respected.
Of course we do not want them.
That is not what this is about.
In my view the choice is simple.
Finally, let us not forget enforcement.
That is what we are trying to achieve.
That is the balance we intend to seek.
The consumer must be king.
We live in the service society.
We all know the feeling.
No, the machine does not work!'
I think that is nice.
I agree - no problem.
We must put people before the market.
We are talking about better law-making.
We made recommendations in that regard.
That is simply too many people.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
I have visited half the Member States.
I personally believe in it.
I would like to refer to some of them.
It works well.

I think it is perfectly possible.
This is a formidable task, indeed.
Firstly, the need for decoupling.
Secondly, there are biofuels.
We have good ones and bad ones.
Lastly, the matter of subsidies.
That is not the right thing to do.
Why is that?
I would like to stress four points.
So let us be really fair on this.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you for your attention.
That much is obvious.
That cannot be.
The market cannot regulate everything.
We must support and promote innovation.
Another key aspect is energy saving.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you for your attention.
The solution must be far more complex.
So, why do we need Europe?

Renewables are our future.
The next item is a joint debate on
We want a European internal market.
We have come a long way.
It is a somewhat complex matter.
I think it deserves to be publicised.
That prospect is unavoidable.
What did we achieve?
I think that is not insignificant.
We all know why that was.
Would we have liked to achieve more?
I extend my thanks to the House.
Quite a lot, in other words!
Clearly this is just one stage.
Passengers are acquiring rights.
That is the subject I want to address.
This is very important.
This is important.
This is the future too, of course.
Thank you.
We are introducing certain limitations.
This was a concrete achievement.
This is another concrete step forward.
We know this is not enough.
I am happy with the outcome.
That too is a form of competition.
I am happy with that outcome.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you very much for your attention.
The consumer will not understand that.
Clearly the duty to invest is crucial.
The debate is closed.

The next item is the joint debate on
Thank you for your kind attention.
This is not fair.
There is a demand to this effect.
Thank you for your attention.
This too would have been required.
This would benefit everyone.
The same applies to cereals and milk.
Soon it will apply to wine.
The only winners will be importers.
They are inappropriate and unfair.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you for your attention.
This has not been possible before.
Previously it was only the industry.
I completely agree with Mr Parish.
The debate is closed.
The voting will take place today.
Written statements (Article 142)
Two Commissioners will speak.
These is the truth of the case.
Corporate responsibility is foremost.
That is what the CE marking means.

Of course, questions remain.
I would merely caution him about that.
As I said, this problem is twofold.
I too am guilty of this on occasion.
The Commission knows this.
We need better protection.
They want to increase profits.
But a number of pertinent issues arise.
Nevertheless, this alone is not enough.
How many children eat barometers?
I leave you with one last thought.
We do not have the expertise.
Mattel toys are sold in the EU too.
The experts think that is absurd.
The experts think that is absurd.
Allergens are also permitted in toys.
What control do we have?
This is partly true.
One further point on toys.
There are many different types of toys.
The range is colossal and unmanageable.
Now I will turn back to Europe.
Thank you.
China is a major trading partner.
What will it take before the EU reacts?
Brazil has already banned imports.
As for us, we are debating.
The Commission must take action.
They deserve this.
Multinationals are not without guilt.
Is there a problem with China?
Yes!
Several of you referred to RAPEX.
This goes without saying.
Nor would this be possible.
There are still more than 900 of them.
All this has already been decided.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Who is responsible for this?
The manufacturer?
The sub-contractor?
The importer?
Everyone?
Or no one?

Explanations of vote
This is not right.
This is not right.
This is not right.
There is no such thing.
That is why we voted against it.
I am fundamentally opposed to this.
Renewable sources represent the future.
That was exactly the path we followed.
(Applause)
This was inexplicable!
Do you understand, though, Mr Antunes?
All this is your immense exertion!
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thus, an opportunity has been wasted.
What do you mean?

I am not here to talk about the past.
Thank you for clarifying that.
(PT) I asked a very specific question.
The debate is closed.
Why a closer relationship with Brazil?
It is very complicated.
That is our question.
It is a representative democracy.
That is absolutely ridiculous.
Instead, what did he do?
We addressed them.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Green Paper on urban transport (debate)
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Mr Jarzembowski, these are proposals.
They are not complete.
I think that is mad!
We would be misguided to do so.
The questions are deliberately open.
Commission Question Time
Part one
It is a vital scheme.
Are you aware of this problem?
But the clock is ticking.
Is that a correct way to continue?
Winter starts on 1 November.
Part two
Within this mandate we could negotiate.
Subject: Amendment of the CMO in wine
That is excluded.
Because this question is a crucial one.
We have had very open talks with them.
ITER is indeed an ambitious project.
This is one of the areas.
That is exactly our approach.
Subject: London buses
The bridge should be completed in 2010.
There you have it.
I will answer Mr Posselt.
I have two brief questions.
Is there any news on these?
That concludes Question Time.
I think this is very important.
I will focus on four main issues.
Firstly, the education aspects.
I am looking forward to the discussion.
Do we not need more?
Why is that?
Should we not do that?
It is an interesting idea.
This will be a test of that.
Why would we not support necessity?
This deficiency is covered by the EIT.
This is absolutely right.
We are a continent of ideas.
We know that.
That is our problem.
This we can say straight away.
Therefore: let us get on with it.
Europe needs this institution.
This is very shocking, very shocking.
Good ideas soon become international.
State-imposed solutions will not work.
Why is this the case?
We could do with that in this debate.
I fully support Mr Paasilinna's report.
EU financing is still problematic.
Hopefully things can only get better.
It cannot be achieved with money alone.
That is understandable.
It has not been easy.
This is excellent.
The EIT title must be desired.
A strong leader is required.
Investment pays off in time.
There has to be a long term strategy.
One final comment.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Written statements (Rule 142)
We need to be competitive.
I support this idea.
What should this policy look like?
I disagree thoroughly with Ms Ek.
(Applause)
Fundamentally, it is a strategic issue.
Thank you.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
Correct!
We do not want this!
It makes no sense for us.
We must offer a parallel strategy.
This is the only credible thing to do.
Thank you.
Gazprom is not a private company.
Take, for example, Alisher Usmanov.
Commissioner, good luck.
You will need it.
Indeed that is what it is in reality.
How to achieve it?
Life will show who is right.
The Russian factor is crucial.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We invest in Russia.
Russia invests here.
So I will stay with this position.
It was very interesting.
That would be too optimistic.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Set aside for year 2008 (debate)
I really am very grateful.
So, thank you for a quick reaction.
I would even go further back than that.
This will keep the debate on track.
Yes, that is correct.
Thus set-aside must go and must go now.
Thank you, again, very much.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Written statements (Rule 142)
We no longer have that.

Honourable Members, good morning!
Madam President ...
(The speaker spoke in Basque)
The next item is the joint debate on
The Council was in full agreement.
Such figures are frankly dangerous.
The European Fund now exists.
That is too few!
The person enters Europe to work.
Indeed, we are already doing so.
This is a major cause for concern.
We will get nowhere alone!
(Applause)
We have to take action now.
Ladies and gentlemen, Frontex works.
The psychological dimension is obvious.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Why?
(Applause)
(Applause)
We should also be logical, however.
- (ES) Yes, Mr President.
(The speaker spoke in Basque)
The very opposite is true!
Have you ever heard of the Mafia?
It states:
This report also states that:
It requires supplementation.
A new approach is needed.
Well hallelujah!
Let us be positive, however.
We have at least made a start.
It must annul these, and quickly.
(Applause)
This is nothing more than our duty.
Be consistent, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you.
What about the others, however?
How foolish we would be to do so.
This is completely absurd.
I congratulate Mr Frattini!
How does it all fit together?
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you, Mr President.
What does all this mean, Mr President?
Very well, that is how it should be.
(Applause)
We talk about the EU's borders.
They are two sides of the same coin.
We need these new arrivals.
They are helping to build Poland.
I should like to add a final comment.
We must get that into our heads.
(Applause)
This brings me to integration.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
It is surely more of a necessary evil.
Welcome
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Gargani.
Those mandates are thus ratified.
We wish the new Members every success.

This is absolutely unacceptable.
Farmers want to produce!
What was supposed to happen happened.
It will be the same for wine.
Companies must be held to account.
But we cannot stop there.
At least that is some form of reaction.
It is time to do this now.
More words for whom?
Iraq, Afghanistan, Africa ...?
You have to have read it to believe it.
I of course support this objective.
I therefore voted against this report.
We wholeheartedly reject this.
That is idiotic.
Better late than never!
We fully agree in this respect.
This is a new challenge for everyone.
My third point relates to air traffic.
This has not happened.
Why?
I have one final point.
Here are two things that you could do.
We agree with you.
This has now been proven.
In my opinion this is wrong!
Because that is what it amounts to.
What did we get?
Very little unfortunately.
No such facts exist.
We do not know.
This is a serious matter.
The debate is closed.
I will now move on to the second point.
A very large area needs to be secured.
That also holds good for Parliament.
Our advice is positive.
This is still not the case at present.
Have we set ourselves clear objectives?
This force has many worthy objectives.
The rainy season is abating.
The time for the UN to act is now.
Inaction is costing lives.
There are no EU troops, Mr Ryan.
What is this force going to do?
The debate is closed.
Situation in Burma (debate)
I agree with him.
We should be ashamed.
I am under no illusions.

Written statements (Rule 142)
Repression has been brutal.
Council Question Time
(PT) Thank you, Mr President.
If so, it becomes very difficult.
That is our commitment.
We have much to do.
Subject: Developments in Kosovo
We would like a clear answer.
Can the Council do that?
It is not the time for that.
There are two parts to my question.
Thank you on behalf of the House.
Subject: Pakistani military assets
Subject: European Union Solidarity Fund
Thank you for your brief answer.
That concludes Question Time.

That work is necessary for two reasons.
That is where industry comes in.
We cannot do this alone.
That cannot be!
We need words to be followed by deeds.
It is also a project that has evolved.
There are hurdles to overcome.
This is a mammoth task.
Of course there are also the risks.
I believe it deserves our support.
No!
Merci!
(Laughter)
I will speak in Hungarian.
That cannot continue!
This is only partly true.
Change is needed.
However, what is the reality?
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)

I would even call it a blind alley.
Even if it were the right way to go.

Why?

We still have not received them.
What wimps!
A constitution for Europe.
He is sorely missed.
I will therefore say no more.
The opt-outs are sad.
I hope it does not set a precedent.
This must remain an exceptional case.
Two thirds of people feel uninformed.
So, what does an opt-out mean?
What does an opt-out mean?

The language!
I cannot read it.
I cannot understand it any more.
Fundamental rights!
He is right!
Those are priorities.
That would be to their discredit.
Wise and prophetic words.
Nobody believes that!
This is unacceptable, Mr President.
Nowhere is safe from a no vote.
Why not write them into certain dates?
(Applause)
Thank you for your attention.
That is the legitimacy of Europe.
We need to get this over and done with.
We will not disregard anyone.

Membership of Parliament
What is the problem we are facing?
This is over!
(Applause)
(Murmurs of dissent)
Nobody is penalised by this report.
We have some amendments.
So we are divided on that.
Hic Rhodus, hic salta!
The Council has no excuse.
There is no pure, definitive formula.
(Applause)
This is decided every five years.
We failed on that occasion.
But let us get things clear.
The answer should be a resounding no!
I digress.
I cannot give my consent to that.
(Applause)
But do we really?
Do we want to go back to Nice?
Does Spain want to lose seats?
Does Poland want to lose seats?
I do not know.
Is that what we want?
Is that what we are here for?
I do not think so.
At least, I do not hope so.
(Applause)
Is he here in the Chamber?
Why should we talk?
The key individuals have left.
Everything is obvious.
We are a small nation.
Today's debate is a perfect example.
This then is a European people.
Can these two things be reconciled?

Thank you very much.
There will therefore be no party line.
Why is this so?
There is a dilemma.
The report clearly endorses this.
Why, then, this debate?
What does it actually mean?
No!
We are not here to re-found the EU.

With five it is impossible.
False!
The debate is closed.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FI) Mr President,
This we cannot accept.
We therefore support it.
The humanitarian situation in Gaza
The Union is the major donor.
No!
And to be unforgiving.
To be sharp, to be responsible.
We can only help them.
They have to stop corruption.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Those double standards reek.
(Applause).
Gaza is an Israeli prison camp!
It is nothing to do with us.

The bombers in Madrid also.
We should not be forgotten.
Shame on the ghetto!
Shame on us Europeans!
Stop the closure!
(Applause)
It is shocking!
Can you imagine anything worse?
Playing Ramallah off against Gaza?
(Applause)
(The President cut off the speaker)
The economy is now in free fall.
In 2006, 1 726 rockets were fired.
That is the wrong strategy.
Arguably, the situation is worse.
Today we have neither.
A new way, a new method is required.
That is, indeed, essential.
We have analysed the situation.
The debate is closed.

One-minute speeches (Rule 144)
I do not.

That concludes the one-minute speeches.
However, let me make one thing clear.

We need more transparency, therefore.
How can this balancing act be achieved?
Different databases must be linked.
It should not only apply to the CAP.
For how long?
A week maybe.
Thank you.
That is the first injustice.
There is a second.
They are forced to leave land fallow.
Take the beef sector.
thirdly, lawbreakers to be punished;
Enormous amounts.
Thank you very much.
My congratulations once again.
Anyway, I digress.
Thank you.
Perhaps they are silly to do that.
We import beef.
Yes, publish, but explain.
So there is no difference.
This is totally public.
The debate is closed.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
I do have a few criticisms, however.

In this letter three demands were made.

The next item is the joint debate on
The subject has always been difficult.
A balance needs to be struck.
I ask for your support.
Let us be sensible about this.
That is also very important.
We are seeking greater harmonisation.
This is the way it should be!
Double the number of pesticides!
There are many examples.
Surely this cannot be the intention.
They are also completely unnecessary.
I am very sceptical about this.
I think we have to face some facts.
Thank you!

UKIP will vote against.
That would be completely wrong.
There are three misunderstandings.
No, this cannot be done!

No, on the contrary!
No!
We all share that ambition.
I have two final points.
Our landscape is different, too.
I would ask for your support.
Thank you for your attention.
That will continue as now.
Let me give you four reasons.
Various problems arise.
Who is the Union for?
Is it for ideologues or for the people?
Yes, hide.
It seems so simple at first sight.
Of that there can be no doubt.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Needless to say, I opt for the latter.
I believe they shape consumer demand.
Let me finish with these remarks.
We can already see the first results.
Thank you for your attention.
We have no alternative.
We should not lose sight of that.
So, what is it?
What is Mr Davies trying to do to us?
(Objections)
Let us just remember that.
This is a practical approach.
But you should be listening as well.
And let me just make this other point.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
What then are we to do?
We must not stop there, however.
Thank you very much.
People out there are watching.
Finally, on labelling and advertising.
We all know that.
The debate is closed.
However, this is far from enough.
I will now come to nuclear energy.
Please consider this particular point.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
It is a disgrace.
The conflicts continue.
For how long can we contain them?

We support the group here.
These are the important answers.

So Felicitas, Jose.

Nonetheless, again: congratulations.
(Applause)
Therefore, mercifully it was short.
That is what I am asking you.
Let the people speak.
Well, we think the exact opposite.
I fully support this process.
For this you have my thanks.

But in one country this is not so.
It was a historic moment.
Thank you Prime Minister S√≥crates.
Europe is out of the impasse.
Thank you very much, Prime Minister.
The Constitution has fared similarly.
We were wrong to think that.
That is why I want to see a referendum.
His fellow leaders have disagreed.
The issue is one of trust.
Laeken asked the right questions.
Have we given the right answers?
Congratulations.
So let us go.
Let us move.
That is what people expect of us.
That would be good.
Mr President, I represent Scotland.
Long live the Constitution!
Which is now true?
I very much hope so.
This has now been the fourth agreement.
I hope that no country says no.
We hope this will not be the case.
This is what most MEPs in here think.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Is it going to come to Parliament?
Finally, the High Representative.
That is our objective, Mr President.
The European Union is back on its feet.
Considerable success has been achieved.
I am in a better position.
This leads me to make two comments.
Is the Treaty perfect, then?
Of course not!
Jean Monnet has an answer for this too.
1957-2007.
No, of course not.
There will be no third treaty.
One crisis is enough. Two is too many.
That is what the Treaty is.
Let us go on.
Nevertheless, there is a problem here.
(Applause)

This is our main task - ratification.
Thanks and congratulations.
No, this Treaty means progress for us.
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
That is not true.
(Applause)
Many thanks, Commission President.
Many thanks.

Voting time
The next item is the vote.
Explanations of vote


The following are symptomatic of this:
We have voted out the top levels here.
We support Integrated Pest Management.
We need general standards for this.
They expect us to do better.
I consider that to be irresponsible.
We also differ in our landscapes.
This must be ensured by regular checks.
We cannot legislate in the abstract!
The next item is the joint debate on
(C6-0287/2007 - and
(C6-0288/2007 -.
This may be the case and I shall check.
This money could be better spent.
Its key elements are as follows:
I am very pleased about that.
Many thanks.
There are always freeloaders there.
We talk about it, but we do nothing.
That is scandalous.
It should not continue.
Thank you very much.
The LUX film award has been set up.
I have just looked at the list.
Another important subject is Palestine.
The second point is transparency.
So far, so good - all of it!
Funding, however, raises questions.
I think that is obvious.

It is as simple as that.
Thank you for your attention.
Pah!
Europe needs Galileo.

The litanies first.
It is a cascade of Malthusianism.
This is truly alarming.
That is a bit rich!
He responded: 'EU?
We give orders, Europe pays!'
This is true, too!
This is essential, however complex.
It is a question of transparency.
They affect people outside the Union.
Firstly, the Parliament budget.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
(The sitting was temporarily suspended)
Membership of Parliament: see Minutes
Commission Question Time
First part
Subject: Child abduction
What is your view on this?
It is the only way.
That is 11 000 people!
What does it cost per year?
Can you imagine specific sanctions?
I am sorry for those who have waited.
That concludes Question Time.
The next item is the debate on
It is a shame we did not go further.
They have refused to do it in the past.
Concerning GMOs, this is a big issue.
That is why I applauded Mr Busk.
Fact one!
Today, we should adopt the same policy.
I have four or five points to make.
How can we tell the difference?
Clearly this is not happening.
The debate is closed.
I think this is the right approach.
We have to be frank about that.
We have had a Green Paper as you know.
I would like to mention two points.
I really regret that.
We know that smoking kills.
That is a good thing.
Many more are on the way.
Up to this point I join the consensus.
What are we going to do, though?
What fine words. What puritanism.
Is this the example we wish to follow?
Let us remain reasonable.
They did not need Europe for this.
Long live freedom, I say.
Smoking costs too much; it costs lives.
Firstly, the tobacco industry.
What are we really talking about here?
It was good to hear different views.
That should be borne in mind as well.
However, that is just one measure.
That is a very important area.
I accept that.
We should not undermine that.
This is not a theoretical discussion.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
It is clear that lawmakers must act.
Half-measures are no longer adequate.
It is time to act in earnest.
Protocol amending TRIPS (debate)
This is certainly too early to assert.
I hope that we agree on this.
There is a risk.
Simply put, this opposition is clear.
We need to go further.
The debate is closed.
Well, this is what we have done here.
We need greater clarity.
A great deal has happened since then.
This has been done and we are glad.
It has not yet yielded any results.
We should learn from our experience.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
The debate is closed.

EU-Turkey relations (debate)
Commitments made need to be met.
It is good that this is still the case.
Some progress has of course been made.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Well, I do not believe that is so.
Is it really about the PKK?
Why should it be different this time?
What are Turkey's intentions?
Full stop, amen, finished.
Let us change the approach.
It has rights and obligations.
Turkey is making significant progress.
Finally, we have to recall one thing.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
Written statements (Rule 142)
But why should that be a criterion?
EU-Russia Summit (debate)

I am just finishing up, Mr President.
Mr Salafranca S√°nchez-Neyra was right.
Minister, are you living on Mars?
Are you living on Venus?
It is not just about energy supplies.
Let us forget about Galileo.
That is quite clear.
We need to finalise the agreement.
Russia is obviously more of a problem.
That is a strange procedure.
Thank you.
We need a sober approach.
It has been in place now for ten years.
This is a major problem.
That has to be underlined.
There is a mutual economic dependency.
Russia has to accept that.
Have we become puppets too?
We do indeed take them seriously.
The debate is closed.

Explanations of vote
Therefore I voted against the report
I make mistakes as much as anyone.
Therefore I voted against the report.
This is unacceptable.
We have much to work on.
I voted in favour of the resolution.

This is the reason for our abstention.
Currently the figure stands at 157 g.
We have not done so.
We have abandoned that route.
This is not what has happened here.
It is time to take action.
The report itself makes this clear.
The opposite is true.
They are quite wrong!
That is precisely what I am opposed to.
I say 'no' to these zealots.
These deaths could be prevented.
What was their crime?
I say this as a friend of Turkey.
EU-Serbia relations (debate)
I believe in Serbian self-respect.
Do it.
You are strong enough.
Together we will manage.
Thank you.
Further efforts are needed.
Thank you, Mr President.
Who is suffering as a result?
Full cooperation has to be established.
This simply leads to chaos.
It is scandalous.
That is not the way forward.
The causes are obvious.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
My comments are as follows:
1.
The principle of values.
2.
3.
Thank you.
That much seems obvious to me.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you very much.
We must continue along this road.
(EL) The debate is closed.
EU-Africa relations (debate)


For we share the same destiny.
This slogan is quite simply dishonest.
We urgently need to put this right.
What was your response?
Is that not unbelievably farcical!
How is that a good idea?
(SV) Thank you Madam President.
Mugabe's terrible rule must be ended.
Thank you.
This is a contradiction.
This is element number one.
The summit therefore has to take place.
We have waited long enough.
So what will it mean?
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
This requires, for example:
guarantee of immigrants' rights.
The next item is the debate on:
No EU common position is planned.
We have seen it in the war in Lebanon.
The EU must bite the bullet.
It cannot be allowed to continue.
I find that extremely alarming.
(SV) Thank you Madam President.
But what is my own country doing?
That is a disgraceful position.
Thank you.

The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Council Question Time
This new regulation is hugely delayed.
I think that is a very good idea.
(PT) Very well.
Subject: Sex offenders
I want to ask about three issues.
That is not very impressive!
(NL).
What are you going to do about that?
Question No 8 has been withdrawn.
Are there any plans for this?
How many properties must be lost?
I am in close contact with his family.
We must also lead by example.
This has been done.
Thank you, President-in-Office.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That concludes Question Time.
On that we are in absolute agreement.
It might even backfire.
There is a clear way ahead.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I am about to end, Mr President.
The reason for this is quite simple.
I wish to highlight two points.
That is exactly what this report does.
International demand is constant.
I am about to finish, Madam President.
I am truly impressed.
Lastly, a few words on overproduction.
Thank you.
The problem is simple, therefore.
That is one point.
These are the realities today.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Will the debtor evade his commitments?
It is not about final settlement.
There is the problem of trust accounts.
We worked together very well.
That is only a story, however.
We have to get tough.
This is the next piece in the jigsaw.
However, I have two points to make.
This is sometimes true.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Some comments on some main amendments.
This, unfortunately, was not possible.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
It is a key area, namely statistics.
This goal has been achieved.
I believe that is the important thing.
At most, there were misunderstandings.
He most certainly was!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.

He makes telling comments.
(SV) Thank you Madam President.
Thank you.
This matter needs to be investigated.
They are not interested in the process.
They just want positive outcomes.
Persuasion is better than force.
(MT) Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you very much.
I take note of your remarks.
Allow me now to switch languages.
The debate is closed.

We need flexibility in all this.

Thank you.
Anything else would be unreasonable.
I find the Commission proposal good.
However, we must also be fair.
That must also be taken into account.
We have to do something about this.
Well, we have to provide some balance.
We are faced with a complex problem.
This has to stop.

Many of these are now coming forward.

We need to do more here.
One of them is international trade.
What are we doing to tackle this?
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Everyone should do their bit.
You need to take action.
That is bound to go wrong.
It is topical for a good reason.
It is also in its early stages.
It is developing all the time.
However, I do welcome it.
Are we going to deregulate?
No, nothing of the kind.
That is laughable!
But you are doing none of that.
You are burying your heads in the sand.
Thank you for your attention.
Lithuania is a case in point.
Sustainable Europe
The Commission's policy is Lisbon.
President Barroso talked about prizes.
Why not?
Give them some encouragement.
That is urgent.
It was promised for this year.
Let us have it please.
That is an important step.
We have got to implement them.
Two things are needed.
An integrated approach to migration
This is major progress.
We cannot leave it at that, however.
That is something we cannot afford.
I have in mind Turkey.
What does it have to do with terrorism?
Putting the citizens first
You really need to do better in 2008.

Priority must be given to this matter.
I would like the agenda of these ...
This is indeed a major problem.
Europe as a world partner
How is that supposed to happen?
Congo is a good example.
Pakistan is a case in point at present.

I thank you again for this debate.

It is not too late to act.

The way forward has been mapped out.
It is therefore a matter of solidarity.
We must be crystal clear about this.

This consultation occurred immediately.
This means that we can now move on.
(PT) We can move forward together.
We argued that this was not necessary.

I must say three things to you.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
Question Time (Commission)
Please come to the front.
Part one
I am very sorry.
We will follow the order I suggested.
We are therefore working on this.
Do you consider this sufficient?
This is a starting point.
These are immediate responses.
These are emergency situations.
There is no other miracle cure.
Clearly we can do more.
This is something we are doing.
They are the main priorities.
This is one of the conditions.
Is the percentage higher or lower?
Are delays not occurring here as well?
Is this helpful for the debate?
We are moving forward at a steady pace.
Is that correct?
Are you not pre-empting it?
We made a promise.
Why?
My question is simple.
I understand perfectly your concerns.
But I cannot act alone.
That concludes Question Time.
What is at issue?
Where are we now, three years later?
That was on 18 October.
Airbus has.
The European Union has.
However, moving forward is essential.
However, there has been no response.
Several speakers have said the same.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)

I thank you all.
I have five comments to make in all.

But the system must work efficiently.
Thank you, David.

Europe is making significant progress.
The results are now bearing fruit.
There are 23 million SMEs in Europe.
(Applause)
(Applause)
That, too, is social policy.
(Applause)
No!
We most certainly do!
We also need effective administration.
(Applause from the left)
Die Rede der Vergangenheit!
We think we do.
The gender pay gap is still there.
That is the challenge.
I am disappointed on two fronts.
The migration policy is unhealthy.
A cartel dominates the oil market.
Where are the resources?
But what is the Commission doing?
(Applause)
What about the other 95%?
Could surrender be the issue here?
Where will they come from?
It is up to us how we make use of it.
Utter mumbo-jumbo!
I wonder why we hush that up.
I rather doubt it.
That is incomprehensible.
Let me raise a few more questions.
That is without a doubt fundamental!
Even Marx did not go that far.
Allow me to highlight two points:
All this is true.
But, unlike him, I am glad about that.
That is also part of globalisation.
What have we done?'
We must look at that.
He is right.
The guidelines need to be changed.
We must also embed the Lisbon Strategy.
So we need to be pro-active.
Darwin called it natural selection.
European citizens are fearful.
Stop the faint-hearted excuses.
What is missing?
(HU) Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you, Madam President.
Well, it is broken and it needs fixing.
The second point concerns SMEs.
The situation cannot be reversed.
Globalisation is a fact.
We cannot and we do not seek to.
Europe must change slightly.
This is no way to proceed.
This aspect is fundamental.
Let me cite a few examples.
That is entirely correct.
We need a fully joined-up approach.
Let me say something on that subject.
I regard that as a major consideration.
That is no way to react.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Will they have energy?
Let us get to work!
We need a policy to cover:

(Applause)
Explanations of vote
Soil is a farmer's most precious asset.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Let us be more serious, please!
Thank you.
The cons outweigh the pros, however.
Hence our final vote to abstain.
Thank you for your attention.
They must be protected.
Russia is not Europe's partner.
Russia is holding us hostage.
Situation in Pakistan (debate)
They should be set free immediately.
What do we do in this situation?
What can we, as the European Union, do?
Afghanistan is a common global problem.
He must reinstate the Constitution.
We remain engaged.
Pakistan is, therefore, full of hope.
However, this civil society needs help.
It is very serious.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the debate on
There are many encouraging signs.
(Applause)
They need our assistance.
That is precisely where we are heading.
We need both.
That is unacceptable.
There is no room for further delay.
This is what we expect, Mr Dimas.
But for how much longer?
We have a very good basis.
That is a good question.
I believe we can offer three things.
It is absurdly small.
The need is hundreds of times greater.
No one is denying that.
How do we maximise the impact?
We should also reflect on costs.
The debate is closed.
The next item is a joint discussion on:
That is the basic idea.
I just wanted to add that.
The ENP is ultimately a win-win policy.
One could say a mixed satisfaction.
(Applause)
Both are admissible.
This is not what most Londoners want.
(Applause)
I found it a very complex situation.
Thank you.
For what purposes?
For whose benefit, I ask.
Keep it up, Commissioner.
I have one burning question to ask.
I think it is. Indeed!
Neighbours are just that: neighbours.
That is the important point.
I believe that is not the case.
This strong link, however, must exist.
Thank you.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
We must give all our support to this.


It will be difficult.
But such are the facts of the matter.
Some action plans will expire soon.
(RO) I appreciate Mr. Tannock's report.
Let me cite Egypt as an example.
I fear not.
We should be very clear on that.
On the contrary.
The reflection group is working.
My last point is on financing.
Many have said that we need more funds.
Therefore, let us have more.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
Question Time (Council)
The following questions were presented.
Is it being implemented?
Please give us your candid response.
We shall see.
Subject: European Security Strategy
Can the EU help with that?
Have we got specific projects?
Question time is closed.
What does the report cover?
This process is already under way.
The report is very timely.
It is worth benefiting from them.
That is a great success.
Thank you.
Allow me to make a few remarks.
We shall see how that develops.
The ball is now in Ukraine's court.
The European Union has work to do too.
Ukraine is developing rapidly.
To my surprise, he did not deny it.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you very much for your attention.
The following need attention:
The debate is closed;
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Written statements (Rule 142)
However, let me express two concerns.
Everyone knows the true picture!
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
So I will get on with it.
Now for some specifics.
So much for informing the citizen!
Now, why should that be?
The debate is closed.
But what is it we are talking about?
Let me cite three relevant examples.
Let me make one last point.
The debate is closed.

Situations of fragility
Is Iraq a fragile state?
Thank you very much, Mr Deva.
The debate is closed.
Social reality stocktaking (debate)
We face a huge challenge in Europe.
That challenge is one of fairness.
Those are truly shocking statistics.
But what do they actually mean?
Barriers to opportunity are complex.
Access to integrated job markets;
Better access to services;
Adequate income support.
I have two comments to make.
On the contrary, poverty is increasing.
We know what the problems are.
It is time to take action at last.
It should not exist.
We must deal with this.
Our citizens expect that much of us.
I most definitely support this draft.
We should not, however, make a mistake.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Thank you very much, Mr Salafranca.

Explanations of vote
Hence our vote.
I support these proposals.
This is not freedom of movement!
We are not alone in our view.
The report is very good.
It would be best to read the report...
Thus the report:
Enough said...
1.
I would therefore ask...
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is true of this resolution.
Why?
What is needed is help and assistance.
Certainly not!
We are currently in the third phase.
(Applause)
It is not true.
What is this identity?
The list is long.
I support it wholeheartedly.
That is what we are currently doing.
We must use this method too.
We do not want to hide our convictions.

This brings me to the conclusions.
Let me clarify.
This point also needs explaining.
(Applause from certain quarters)
It is not an option, it is mandatory.
That really is a scandal.
Let us look to the future.
I welcome that initiative.
That is progress.
Well, I can tell you, the answer is no.
From incorrect form-filling?
Are these real errors?
It is cause for some indignation.
What are the sticking points?
Does it stand by them?
That is not good enough.
We have to do something about that.
Where is Belgium, France, Germany?
(Applause)
Why has that happened?
Of course not!
There are two ways to go.
Is there the will to do that?
I doubt it.
What are the practical implications?
And that is despotic behaviour.
Why is that not investigated?
Why are appropriate steps not taken?
This cannot go on.
I would like to make three points.
I like the system of traffic lights.
My congratulations on that.
That can be improved upon.
We need to do things better.
Things must be done better.
This is both good and positive.
It is almost a textbook example.
We hope that there is.
Mr President, we have a baker's dozen!
Our citizens cannot understand that.
So please continue along these lines.
We also congratulate the Commission.
Now we come to the structural funds.
We must move forward.
We cannot go on like this.
Thank you again for your comments.
That concludes this item.

Golf courses do not qualify

Thank you, Mrs Ayala.

They live on them and from them.
This is our only hope of success.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 142)
I wish to emphasise this at the outset.
We therefore have to assess this.
First of all, the stricter standards.
We can breathe again!
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
However, this is only the beginning.

I support this policy wholeheartedly.
The debate is closed.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
We should not just talk, but act.
Welcome, Mr Ho≈Çowczyc!
My sincere congratulations!
I am proved right.
I was right.
This needs to be taken into account.
It is anonymous data.
The debate is closed.
Toy Safety (debate)
We had expected this round about now.
There has obviously been a delay.
Various matters still lie ahead of us.
That is one thing.
Yes, a murder weapon.
Not enough, I am sorry to say.
What purpose, Madam Commissioner?
Your English is wonderful!
This is not right either.
We need the principle of prevention.
Supervision is good; laws are better.
Anything else is unthinkable.
A single dangerous toy is one too many.
We have seen the results of that.
Let us be realistic.
One final point: the Member States.
The debate is closed.
European Contract Law (debate)
We have moved forward.
Oblivious to the world - self-obsessed.

We need it, and we need it urgently.
That is good news.
We know there is ongoing work.
We can be at your side.
The debate is closed.
There are a few problems, however.
So I very much welcome this debate.
I very much welcome the debate.
I think that this is shameful.
We will pass it on to the Council.
The debate is closed.

The second big issue is capitalisation.
We will find a way through this.
We have put into this reform...
(The President cut off the speaker)
So what is the status quo?
We share your view on that point.
Sugaring is an old oenological process.
Why make this sort of proposal?
Why have they stopped drinking wine?
The answer is that it is not.
I wish to highlight two points here.
The first idea is Malthusianism.
The third idea is globalism.
I consider this to be unacceptable.
Thank you.
It is wine with tradition behind it.
Wine originated here!
The two things do not go together.
The devil, as always, is in the detail.
(Applause)
(HU) Thank you very much.
I agree with the bases for the reform.
We have been OK up to now.
This is not happening.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for your attention.
We should not promote distillation.
Thank you for your kind attention.
It is time to do a deal.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
I will be back for final comments.
The first element is cross-compliance.
What could we change in this area?
There may be more to come.
That is too much of a good thing.
We need to be proportionate.
So I think we need to be practical.
It has a specific social role.
We impose conditions on them.
I regret that.
I have just had an inspection myself.
Yes, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is right.
Thank you for the discussion.
Written statements (Rule 142)
This is certainly justified.

(Applause)
The victims feel disappointed.
Thank you so much.
Explanations of vote
We agree with all this.
We are today voting on this opinion.
The decision merits broad support.
This amendment reinforces this.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Two things, therefore, need to be done.
I am in favour of such a solution.
Silesia is the area most affected.
Simplification is absolutely essential.
In this we succeeded.
(Applause)
Thank you very much to everyone.
Congratulations to everyone.
This we promised, and we will deliver.
Two points are absolutely clear.
Everyone has commended it.
Thank you again.
So let us change it!
This costs amazingly little.
That is a success.
This is the proper task of the EU.
The bill, moreover, just keeps rising.
But why is force needed?
Why did the Council not act sooner?
Thank you for your kind attention.
I think the latter.
Its successors, however, will not be.
This is the first positive message.
For me it is not.
- (MT) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Written statements (Article 142)
The outcome is an historic one.
He has clearly shown us the way.
The remarks are positive remarks.
This is a positive feature.
(Applause)
Is that a long enough list?
Where are those children?
Are things any better in the EU?
That is called real solidarity.
Are they negotiable?
This is an excellent report.
There is much poverty here.
One thing is certain.
How long will we condone genocide?
We have done this.
They are available.
Religious freedoms have been mentioned.
This has been clearly mentioned.
I would just like to mention that here.
Things have been done.
On Sudan: we heard Mr Osman here today.
So, again, Chechnya is not forgotten.
Let me finally say a word on India.
The debate is closed.
These are, of course, difficult issues.
These are public political commitments.
What we have to do is reach agreement.
Substance was in short supply here too.
(Applause)
This was a summit of equals.
Why, Mr Vice-President?
This is a very important question.
This is totally unbelievable.
In a way he was right.
Well, you could certainly say that!
That is not the case at all today.
These are worthy aims.
We see more clearly now.
First of all, a partnership of equals.
Secondly, a partnership of peoples.
The EU-Africa Summit was a success.
On the contrary!
The second point is Darfur and Sudan.
No, that is not true.
What, then, have we proposed?
Well then, what have we proposed?
This is precisely my point.
All this is legitimate.
What else did we do?
What is this bureaucratic term?
I hope they will come through on this.
It is therefore extra money.
This is all on the table.
We will see what will emerge from this.
I can see the result.
This, then, is the big difference.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
But is this enough?
Question Time (Commission)
Part one
That is the nice part of the story.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I was very happy with your answer.
Across Europe there is a 19% take-up.
I would mention Croatia and Romania.
The question is the cost.
The absorption rate is 49%.
The absorption rate is 19%.
And if so, when?
Questions 67 and 83 are inadmissible.
That concludes Question Time.
Thank you all very much.
What has been achieved?
(Applause)
It was high time we did.
This represents an increase of 150%.
That is my vision.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
What is more important than safety?
I am worried.
Mrs Blakey told me this personally.
You were right to persist.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
EASA must not be affected by this levy.
Eurovignette (debate)
This is the first point.
This is our work schedule.
As you can see, it is quite intense.
My first question is as simple as that.
And so to my second question.
Some of them have already been aired.
Our bid failed.
That is not possible.
I am most determined on this issue.
The debate is closed.
Thank you very much.
This includes Community export refunds.
What is going on?
Of course not.
Tulips are vital to peace'.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
What should we focus on in particular?
Legal protection of designs (debate)
We did not reach a conclusion then.
Most of them are unconvincing.
Allow me to cite a number of examples.
It is a long-overdue step.
I agree with him.
That was a rather unsavoury episode.
That is anti-competitive stupidity.
That really needs no further comment.
I am opposed to Amendments 6, 7, and 9.
This is an extraordinary anomaly.
I hope the Council will accept that.
Let us here choose the internal market.
Let us make a choice for the consumer.
The debate is closed.

I did not get one valid example.
The democratic deficit will grow.
(Applause)
Why?
(Applause)
That is the main requirement.

Europe is a sham democracy.
He is right.

Let them set the day.
That has to change.
The responsibility is ours.
Europe is above all a matter of trust.
Things have changed since 1991.
Schengen will be discussed.
I have nothing further to say.
I refer to the question of Kosovo.
We had 120 days to do it.
We must present a united front.
Unity must therefore be our watchword.

Thank you, Commission.
Thank you very much.
Obrigado, Mr President-in-Office.
Thank you, Manuel Lobo Antunes.
My third comment concerns migration.

Extremism is a cancer in our society.
What is extremism?

Therefore, it is not enough to condemn.
Commissioner, we cannot permit this.
There has to be a strong reaction.
That cannot be allowed.
Let us be united in diversity.

Racist violence is to be condemned.

But we know that is not enough.

There are many reasons for this.
Thank you.
We need to reinvent citizenship.
We need new ways to learn democracy.
Firstly, education.
Personally, I did not.
Let us constantly express that.

Further bankruptcies are imminent.
This is a serious threat.
Now for my contribution.

Let me make two last points on this.
The debate is closed.
That goes without saying.
One particular subject was Kaesong.
Our negotiators should take note of it.

Question Time (Commission)
Part one
Could we do anything here in Europe?
Subject: Carbon dioxide emissions
I have the full text here.
So the answer to your question is yes.
Part two
They all committed to this.
That is an important step.
Subject: Profiteering by food shops
And that is why it is there.
We are waiting for further information.
Subject: Irish county development plans
We will see how we proceed from there.
The answer is no.
That is a fact.
He is well-briefed on the matter.
Subject: Online airline ticket sales
They continue to mislead the consumer.
Pay no fees, taxes, levies or charges'.
Total price: free flight EUR 67.
What more evidence do you want?
I do not want to sound defensive.
I am doing what I am required by law.
That concludes Question Time.
Thank you, Mr Crowley.
We therefore welcome this report.
I have a few more comments to make.
An example of these is childcare.
We must concentrate on that group.
Thank you for your attention.
You do not even want to listen.
I congratulate our rapporteur.
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen.
It means a new beginning in middle age.
Thank you, Mrs Pack!

Do not forget methanol and cellulose!

It is an important Presidency.
This should not be!
Food prices are also rising.
Do not be hasty.
Welcome.
(The President cut off the speaker)
You are Celts - me too!
What a history!
So make it a higher priority.
(Applause)
Is this acceptable?

Please allow me one final comment.
Relocations may, of course, take place.

We now need the action.
We waited and had this delayed.
That must wait no longer.
I wish you success in that.

That is a recipe for success.
You have three big tasks.
Good luck!
For it is quite simply not the case.
I therefore expect an answer.
Certainly, that must be a priority.

Situation in Kenya (debate)
That is a tragedy.
We need to remember these things.
All options are currently on the table.
What is to be done?
This must not happen again.

Our unity here is a good sign.
Obviously not.

We cannot close our eyes this time.
I doubt it.
Kenya is running tremendous risks.
Kenya must not become another Somalia.
It is not yet too late.
What are the main points?
How can we visualise this?
I have no illusions about this.
But what solution?
I agree with that too.
Budget support is controlled.
EUROPOL (debate)
Our work therefore needs to continue.
I thank him sincerely for this.
Why?
However, freedom has its downside.
That is grotesque.
How high is that price?
But this is all smoke and mirrors.
We have been doing so since 1992.
It is not flexible enough.
I disagree with Mr Stubb.
That is not what we are trying to do.
That is all.
I cannot guarantee more that this.
I will be very brief.
What does this say?

Thank you very much.
I was.
Crime is transnational.
Guarantees are very important to us.
Why?

Your protest is noted, Mr Van Orden.
Question Time (Council)
Do you have any initiatives on that?
Thank you for your reply.
Most carers tend to be family carers.
My congratulations on that.
We will do our best.

Let me mention just a few of those.
Azerbaijan is in a similar situation.

The rest is rhetoric.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you.
Yes, that is possible.
It will consume vast amounts of money.
Ask the people.
That is not the case at present.
I see two possibilities.
Unfortunately the road to that is long.
sources and energy independence.
Our report calls for the latter.
Thank you.
I therefore say this as a friend.
This situation should be changed.
The region welcomes all real aid today.
This is not an easy task.
I would like to make three points.

Welcome
That is what we are doing now.
Let us never forget that.
First, respecting the targets.
I think they have got this wrong.
(Applause)
We want industry to remain in Europe.
(Applause)
There are real opportunities there.
We must seize this chance.
(Applause)
(Applause)
That must be our aim.
(Applause)
Will there then be import levies?
You said that will happen.
They will be hotly contested.
Maybe the dream is coming true now.
The target is perhaps 10% too high.
I am sure Mr Dimas does.
It was a wonderful feeling.
I was often proud of you, Mr Dimas.
(Applause)
We are prepared to do that.
(Applause)
Thank you again.
It came at the right time.
That is not possible.
It must be tight, and it must be fair.
Then I shall be right behind you.
(Applause)
I agree with his verdict on Bali.
We must go with facts.
We have already reached that ceiling.
That will be the first great test.
There is also another test.
We will have the courage.
Is this deliberate?
Of course not.
Global warming has stopped.
I have three points.
Those are my three points today.
This is a fact.
These are important factors.
I have two principal fears.
(LV) Thank you, Madam President.

In fact we can actually deliver!
I fully agree with its priorities.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Now, however, we have a second chance.
I would like to thank you for that.
I think we have gained time.
I think it is fair.
We are going to present it.
I agree with that.
I think we have to do more.
Let us hope they will accept that.
This is an important issue.
Are they perfect?
Let us discuss it.

Brussels part-session:
(Parliament approved the request.)

The Rules allow no such latitude.
You cited Rule 19(1).
Hardly!
We are a small minority.
Put the Treaty of Lisbon to the people.

Situation in Iran (debate)
Mr Solana, the floor is yours.
Let me start by making a few remarks.
It is a key supplier of arms to Hamas.
All we hear about is enrichment.
There are many good ideas in this area.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Iran is at an impasse.
(Applause)
Duly noted.
Welcome
I bid you all a warm welcome.
(Applause)
Let me say a word on that.
The second big issue is regional.
The second point is Lebanon.
However, that is not enough.
Why are they outstanding?
Now weaponisation has three elements.
That is one part.
We are concerned.
We should listen to her.
A civil society is the first aspect.
The student scene is fairly lively.
It is time we did so too.
He is quite right.
Why?
It has been split.
It has been in a resigned mood.
You asked me what I would like to see.
I cannot speak on behalf of anybody.
The second question concerns waste.
Thank you very much, Mr Solana.
The debate is closed.
Situation in Gaza (debate)
What can we Europeans do?
What can we do?
Did they escape to Egypt?
It was a surreal sight.
After that, everyone went home.
We now have a historic responsibility.
Well done!
That is the whole issue.
Hamas is now more popular than ever.
The West Bank is not the borders.
That is one problem.
Peace is concrete, not abstract.
That is the truth.
What happens now?
It is up to Europe to act.
This is an unarmed European corps!
This is the current situation.
Truth can make the difference.
It is not just Gaza.
We must block ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Have you any news, Commissioner?
Is humanitarian aid reaching Gaza?
That is one side of the coin.
You can say whatever you want.
You may not like it -
(Objection)
Are we able to resolve the situation?
I do not know.
You do not know.
I am not going to let him down.
There will be frustrations.
It will be frustrating.
Are we going to solve all the problems?
I do not know.
I promise you that I will go there.
That is true.
That is our responsibility.
We do.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Article 142)
US anti-missile defence system (debate)
That is clear.
We wholeheartedly support this.
The public are anxious.
My Group remains opposed to the system.
It is a European decision.
Is this not a manipulation of words?
We are surprised at Russia's reaction.
My final point concerns effectiveness.
Finally, a third point.
That is absolutely essential.
This action would reverse the trend.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
New user services have been developed.
In my view this is a good deal.
Now look at the both of us!
Thank you.
Fact number one: who will benefit?
They will benefit.
I believe it is misguided.
That has not been done in this case.
No openings for democracy.
It is a one-way street.
You are failing to learn from history.
The Soviet Union went.
What are they?
Thank you for your attention.
I think we are making a mistake.
This keeps us safe.
Subsidiarit√© oblige!
(HU) Thank you, Madam President.
I hope you will today.
We must not let it happen here.
That is something else to ponder.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
This cat-and-mouse game is over.
We must do what we can.
I have high hopes of emissions trading.
We can put those into power stations.
Not one of them has been omitted.
Please beware these attempts.
The answer, however, is: not quite yet.
Is that not stupid?'
He is right.
Why?
Because it was ...
Indonesia is a developing country.
Are these targets going to be reached?
What are we facing?
What is there an opportunity for?
Wherein lies the problem?
This is important.
We gained important partners.
Another possibility is nuclear power.
Is it therefore a destructive agent?
So what should be done?
That is our absolute priority.
We can all do better here.
Let us seek an intelligent compromise.
It was moderately successful.
Let us decide to do that.
What do we have to do next?
Firstly, we cannot slacken our efforts.
We cannot talk solely about CO2.
Can I raise just one particular issue?
The point was made about forests.
This is already below 1990 levels.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you very much.
(President interrupts the speaker)
Mr Litvinenko was soon murdered.
There were proposals agreed in 2004.
The older Member States have not.
COPD killed 2.7 million people in 2000.
I cannot do that at home.
Thank you.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
We could say "Hurrah!
Thank you.
It is not just about money.
Mentalities are hard to change.
That had to happen one day.
I would like to give three examples.
We will definitely deliver.
A new culture has developed.
I call on the pride of prime ministers.
Come on, prime ministers!
Finally, on my good friend Schatzi:
Everything takes time.
Today I met a Minister from Montenegro.
So I believe ambition is needed.
So I thought this an excellent report.
I think that this is worrying.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
This is a dismal record.
It is also its primary interest.
We need to take action right away.

This is not the only problem, however.
Turning now specifically to the report.
So where are we in the process?
But the reality is more complicated.
It has many benefits.
(That's a joke, Madam President).
I think it is excellent.
These are very conservative estimates.
It gives me a certain optimism.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
This has to be possible.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you very much.
Why did that raise such high hopes?
With the EGTC, they found a solution.
Mr Beaupuy also mentioned this.
So there is no threat here either.
This is also important to bear in mind.
Again, thank you for your interest.

2008 is a year of transition.

We are ready to cooperate.
There are no black holes.
He has declined so far.
I hope he might reconsider.
Frontex springs to mind in this regard.
That is not all.
This is unacceptable.
Instead of 'and', your text reads 'or'.
This is something you must correct.
My friends, we do not need it.
I do not think so.
This is the wrong way round.
The legal basis is unclear.
The ratification process is underway.
Today we have an exercise under way.
Lastly, immigration.
Finally again, asylum policy.
Again, we have not received a reply.
I would like a written reply.
Thank you Mrs in 't Veld.
The debate is closed.
It is a good and necessary initiative.
Indeed, the report itself admits this.
We oppose it.

Oral explanations of vote
This is not stifling debate.
I am very concerned about it.
But what of future presidents?
Mr President, I am sorry.
We saw an explosion in innovation.
This was after a massive consultation.
I also own a somewhat old family home.
So let us get this in context.
Written explanations of vote
I voted against this report.
Unbelievable.
We support this initiative.
Talking is not enough.
On both points, we are clear.
Quite the contrary.
Hence our abstention.
I voted in favour of the resolution.
They store huge amounts of CO2.
We have yet to achieve this.
No to persecution and bludgeoning.
It was good that the report was passed.
The reason is capitalist production.
Our fish stocks are still low.
Hence our abstention.
They fall easy prey to capitalism.

Any solution sets a precedent.
This is extremely important.
This is not the case, however.

Thank you.
I will certainly be doing so.
And why?
Now is not the time to pick rows.
Please hear us.
That concludes the item.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.

The report addresses five main issues.
(Applause)
We make our rules ourselves.
These are important issues.
(Applause)
However, this is an exception.
It takes two to tango.
Do they have something to hide?
Usually you do that three ways.
We should always stress that.
The Commission is doing a good job.
My final comment concerns Mr R√ºbig.
There are two things I want to say.
That is a little different.
There are some nuances.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written Statements (Rule 142)

Thank you, Mr President.
Allow me to comment on four of them.

Germany is a very specific case.
How can OLAF do its job without names?
Thank you very much.
Agriculture is doing relatively well.
It really is quite remarkable.

Community Customs Code (debate)
Why?
Very simple, very clear, on the record.
Thank you, Mr Newton Dunn.
The debate is closed.
There is a great deal that unites us.
Recruitment must be stopped.
We must respect fundamental rights.
Dialogue is the key to tolerance.
This is not true.
Why is this?
Shall we call them terrorists?
These are certainly useful measures.
We simply will not manage it.
That does not help combat radicalism.
I believe that this is unfortunate.
Is that Spanish internal politics?
One has to be coherent.
I should like to recall one last point.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Article 142)
This has produced good results.
(Applause)
It is a matter of reciprocity.
Why not?
Those are our principal amendments.
I am uneasy about the ten-point list.
That is where we can remove rules.
Others must be allowed to do the same.
It creates prosperity across the world.
They are really very good.
I think that they belong together.
That too is immensely important.
Are you conceding defeat at the WTO?
This is a first for the global economy.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Article 142)
That is what I propose to encourage.
Everything you said then is still true.
We need a reform of the instruments.
We must not forget the matter.
I think there is quite a lot.
It is about transparency and openness.
What do we need to discuss then?
Let us give it a try.
But back to the TDI.
What is a European enterprise?
The consumers?
The voluntary organisations?
Small businesses?
Large companies?
What is important now?
We share your view.
You are absolutely right.
We see this just as you do.
China is real.
Where are we going then?
You have not yet closed the drawer.
Where should this road take us then?
Where should the consultations take us?
I believe indeed that this says it all.
Why is it so?
That is my question to you.
And I make no apology for doing that.
Those are the questions that I put.
The debate is closed.

What is the marking exactly?
How can we reinforce controls?
Working with you has been a lot of fun.
They did an excellent job.
The third point is to ask what we did.
So we have shifted the burden of proof.
No, the goods move freely.
You should not be having to apply.
(Applause)
As entertaining as ever, Mr Stubb!
I go back to the example of toys.
I have two products here today.
However, consumers are confused.
It does not mean it is safe.
There is no doubt about it.
Other examples will follow shortly.
(Applause)
That is a good thing.
We are, however, far from finished.
We certainly must put a stop to this.
This is a recurring issue.
This package has three elements.
The balance has been maintained.
I regard that as a very important step.
Well, interesting, is it not?
We must be seen to be busy.
Yet we do not, do we?
How they must laugh behind our backs.
Well, we were wrong!
It is a fine piece of work.
So I think this will work well.
It lasted two years.
So I bought another good one.
It lasted two years.
This is a very positive step.
Thank you for that.
All too often the principle is ignored.
(SV) Thank you, Madam President.
Who else?
This is the first problem.
This is the second problem.
(Applause)
He is greatly missed.

We have thanked very many people today.
These concern the CE marking.
It is a marked improvement.
That should and must be done.

Debate on the future of Europe (debate)
V√§lkommen till Europaparlamentet!
Welcome!
(Applause)
And we have certainly been practising.
But so do ordinary people.
We all stand to gain from this.
This is an untenable situation.
The strategy exists.
We must resist this.
And there is no time to lose.
This is unreasonable.
Most just worked and died.
And they worked from a young age.
That is our responsibility.
Belarus is Europe's last dictatorship.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you, Prime Minister.
We shall now move on to the debate.
That is true.
Let us make no bones about that.
(Heckling)
You spoke about Turkey.
Clarification is essential.
Or am I wrong?
That was good.
Citizens do not want less Europe.
They want Europe to think big.
(Applause)
Finally, on the issue of free trade.
Let me just run through the facts.
He did none of these things.
Caveant consules!
This is where I work.
It is a dynamic place.
They include Kosovo.
Openness towards the world around us.
That is where discrimination occurs.
The environment is more important.
Europe should not allow this.
Thank you.
I have brought an example with me.
This lamp is an LED lamp.
It takes 12 seconds to screw it in.
Then we come back to trade.
The result is a two-tier labour market.
Sweden can change this.
Without women Europe has no future.
I have one final comment.
Welcome!
In Scotland, we move on too.
That is the view of the Swedish people.
That is no future.
It won't be any longer if Turkey joins.
But that is not the point.
(SV) Mr President.
Welcome to Fredrik Reinfeldt.
He was absolutely right.
I think it is the other way around.
We have a common labour market.
Is the Posting Directive a problem?
The Part-Time Work Directive?
The Parental Leave Directive?
You have handled this well in Sweden.
Why is this?

It is not a bad form of democracy.
We therefore sent it back.
The matter will come back.

Key activity 2: foreign languages.
Or have I misunderstood?
I am unable to however.
My apologies.
Could I put a question to you?
It is as simple as that.
We will see.
So it is open.
That is the real problem.
That is indeed a big problem.
And it concerns educators, of course.
So progress is being made.
These are concrete actions.
That concludes Question Time.
The reasons are well known.
So we are not starting from scratch.
Dialogue has to be clear and frank.
I am counting on your support.
This is a considerable step forward.
Kazakhstan, an important point.
One final comment.
Thank you.
Let me make two points.
The German Presidency initiated it.
Thank you very much.

Who here fears the voice of the people?
I do not.
Well, pull the other one!
It is nonsense.
It is all part of the lie.
Why?
This is an unacceptable attitude.

It establishes the mechanisms.
The difference is in presentation only.

I come from Ireland.

We should take our bearings from this.
This is the answer to these challenges.
That is the point.

Allow me to add one more sentence.
That is a rather serious matter.
He mentioned the word 'chicken'.
We will see what UKIP looks like.
I have three points.
What happened in 2005 was unfortunate.
It is also an improvement of democracy.
Indeed, this is a very good report.
This 30% is very interesting.
(Applause)
We have no consolidated text.
It is an absolute scandal!
Why are you running scared?
We must listen to the people.
They demand a referendum.
(The President cut off the speaker)
What does this mean?
I wish us all luck.
Thank you.
It was a plan associated with a myth.
A few points bear constant repetition.
Babel will undoubtedly build its tower.
It is much more than that.
I do not see it in the Treaty myself.
It will lead to negative consequences.
I therefore intend to vote against it.
I think this is plain to see.
As the saying goes, nobody is perfect.
It beggars belief!
It is not true and it is not so.
That reform is now actually here.
It will have to be.
Again, it will have to be.
We now have the perfect vehicle.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
Where is the rationality in that?
These activities are numerous.
Absolutely nothing.
It is available on the internet.
Thank you for this debate.
It is pure laziness.
That is hypocrisy in the extreme.

If I am wrong, prove me wrong.
Put the Lisbon Treaty to the vote.
Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est!
(Applause)
That is why I abstained.
Written explanations of vote
We support the new treaty.
This is very important.
Only the Member States can ratify it.
However, we must be clear.
This new Treaty is just a last resort.
To give just a few examples:
That is why we voted against it.
This is something I am opposed to.
promote capitalist restructuring,
intensify the militarisation of the EU,
adopt the dogma of preventive war,
We want to be more part of Europe.
It is a treaty of euphemisms.
Women deserve to be represented.
That is why we abstained.
I voted in favour of the report.
It is about that one little word: also.
There is no appropriate monitoring.
We have problems with evaluation.
I believe in institutional competition.
We must respect both.
I abstained on this point.
That is why I voted for the report.
These must be fought relentlessly.
The numbers speak very clearly.
Yes, we could!
We wish to hear your progress report.

The pilot project is an excellent idea.
Lastly, I come to our own Parliament.
I do not entirely support that view.
Knowledge and funds are not everything.
A good will to act is also needed.
That is, in effect, a subsidy.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
Introduce democracy in all legislation!
Everything must be open and public.
It has been decided and it will happen.
I can only confirm this.
It is the absolute truth.
I am certain that it does not happen.
That is how it is organised.
Just a few points quickly.
Lastly, the issue of Parliament's role.
The debate is closed.
Kosovo (debate)
The Yugoslav crisis will have to end.
Doors and windows are open.
The wall is no more.
And Serbia's future is in Europe.
(Applause)
Kosovo is not a test case.
It is unique.
(Applause from the right)
We do need to act, however.
No.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Was it attempted?
Yes.
Was there any chance of success?
That will be a while in changing.
This is serious.
Membership?
Within what timescale?
Under what conditions?
Nobody knows.
(Applause)
We should exercise patience.
We should extend a hand to Serbia.
Many people coexist there.
(Applause)
Arson is illegal everywhere.
Stop this hypocrisy!
That explains our opposition.
What are we?
Are we a body of appeal?
Is this Parliament a court of appeal?
This is not acceptable!
(Applause)
Thank you for your attention.
Long live the Europe of the people!
Long live free Padania!
I hope it is not too late.
Shame on us, Munichites!
Its future is, obviously, European.
It is quite an extraordinary situation.
But it must succeed.
There can be no consent to this.
It is not good news for Europe.
This position is not new or unexpected.
(SK) Kosovo has declared independence.
Kosovo is a unique case.
Maybe it will happen now.
Russia is different.
We must not make that mistake.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)

It was only a question of time.
I hope so.
This should be no beauty pageant.
I would like to make three remarks.
Its action is decisive.
We saw it in Gaza.
Similarly, for instance on Sudan.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
What can we expect in the short term?
Are you able to supply such figures?
Thank you.
However, I can say two things.
It shows what can be done.
That is in no way satisfactory.
I think we may need to.
It is quite appalling.
That concludes Question Time.
I am obliged to you.
On this point, the debate remains open.
This trend is due to two factors.
Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you, Mrs Castex.
Firstly, equal pay for equal work!
We need fathers' help.
Thank you very much.
Three minutes, if you would be so kind.

Indeed, it mentions them a great deal.
First of all, birth rate.
We have a long way to go.
Lastly, migration.
But we must do more.
Are we now throwing in the towel?
Look at the advertisements.
Pamper yourself; have it all; buy.
Where are the men?
Raising a child is an enormous task.
(Applause)
Integration processes take a long time.
I would also like...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
Hence the value of this report.
My thanks to the rapporteur once again.
Let me take two sets of examples.
This is a serious human problem.
We have a demographic crisis in the EU.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
This is the wrong direction.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
(The President interrupts the orator)
What, then, should we do?
(I am about to finish.)
Europe is ageing rapidly.
Motherhood has practically no value.
We thank those who worked on it.
This is the big challenge.
But there are many good examples too.
That is a positive phenomenon.
Public policies must back both wishes.
Something has to give.
Twenty years ago it was 3.5 million.
Today it is 4.25 million.
This debate is therefore not yet over.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
This report is a good start.


The statistics say it all.
Crops are being burnt.
The desert is spreading.
The EU average is around 10 tonnes.
So there is much to be done.
Three of those companies are European.
The fourth is from the United States.
The other challenge is climate change.
(PL) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you, Commissioner.

That is the new agenda.
I would like to thank the Rapporteur.
Above all it mentions cohesion funds.
We get to the nub.
Will you ever learn that?
That is a good formula.

That is the best of both worlds.
There is still much to be done.
Thank you for your attention.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Both reports point to this approach.
We must not let them down.
(The President cut off the speaker)

People are afraid.
Security begins with reconciliation.
(Applause)
(Applause)
That has all been said.
Why do these attempts keep failing?
Who are the ultimate losers?
That is the message to both sides.
(Applause)
For peace to succeed, we need dialogue.
We condemn violence from all sides.
This term 'dialogue' tells us nothing.
That is the point.
And how does one negotiate?
That is what I call negotiation.
We must say that to the Israelis.

All this should be out of the question.
We will continue to negotiate.
It also ties the Commission's hands.
First: divide and rule.
Third: collapse of solidarity.
Fourth: the legality of the agreement.
That is the reality of the situation.
How bizarre is that?
This has to stop.
The ball is in Europe's court.
There is an irony in there somewhere.
A step-by-step approach is essential.
Twelve months on, they all are.
I say that very frankly.
Why?
What have we done?

We will adopt a decision soon.
Nothing of the sort exists at present.

This is a difficult balance.

Annual policy strategy 2009 (debate)
Citizens are entitled to clarity.
It is so amusing.
We are even beaten by North America.
Sustainable Europe?
Well, fascinating, is it not?
Then we look at managed migration.
Well, dear, oh dear.

We discuss both; we amend nothing.
Heading 4 is of course underfunded.
How are we going to use conditionality?
What lesson can we learn from this?
Why is that?
What has transpired?
The first one is climate.
It is not, I deeply regret.
I miss the Small Business Act.

Mr President, I welcome this statement.
Thank you very much.
This means more democracy, I would say.
I think they are indeed very important.

Many people spoke of the location.
This is an issue for the Council.
I was not isolated.
I am not alone.
Once again, thank you very much.
This is the way we can work together.

I have mixed feelings about modulation.
This leads to unfair competition.

I do not agree with this approach.

The next item is the debate on
How much does it change your behaviour?
Not a great deal.
Who does not know this?
We are working on all of these things.
I would just like to be very brief.
I do not think this is the case.
I think we are losing time in Europe.
We need to go further.
Fourthly, how do we move forward?
There is a lot of work being done.
The debate is closed.
Commission Question Time


Of course, we discussed everything.
I think we need this.
I shall be very brief.
We do more than we used to.
- (LT) I have a question, Commissioner.
Could you please give any examples?
We support these aspects.
I do not want my answer to be too long.
As a result, I could not be here.
It is absolutely crazy.
It is a commitment I welcome.
We shall look into that further.
We do not have any in Central America.
That concludes Question Time.
Thank you.
I think this would be worth emulating.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
The rural world is not homogenous.
That needs to be addressed.
So let us give it some context.
Might I say that I objected strongly!
(SK) Thank you, Mr President.
I fully subscribe to this approach.
We have pointed this out here.
We want to broaden the view.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Thank you.
Thank you for your attention.
That is of course unacceptable.
That is not necessarily a good thing.
Forget carbon footprints.
Thank you.
How are we to go about this?
I would urge him not to pursue that.
He has done a very thorough job.
More research is urgently required.
I will also push to reduce red tape.
Here we have a very clear approach.
We will need imports.
Once again my thanks to the rapporteur.
It has been a very good report.
Writing this report was easy.
Thank you for your attention.

We cannot.

These are no mean achievements.
A lot has to be done.
So we need to continue our efforts.
Far from it.
First, the most important area.
The most important area is people.
This is a crucial moment for Europe.
In Europe it is still not like that.
(Applause)
(Applause)
That is the first challenge.
We must also halt the brain drain.
This is not insignificant.
(Applause)
(Applause)
That is also a fact.
(Applause)
This represents a social imbalance.
Our citizens must have confidence!
It is increasingly being put at risk.
Yes!
That goes without saying.
That is another blow!
(Applause)
The contours of the challenge are wide.
We also need to lead by example.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
A normal salary does not count.
Collective bargaining does not count.
You can see our proposal on my website.
What do these men want?
As a rule they are men!
What would happen next?
We therefore need the following model.
First, there must be 100% auctioning.
That was perfectly reasonable.
Consumer confidence now has to recover.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for your attention.
It must be more socially aware.
That is good.
That, my friends, is a challenge!
Is there any truth in this?
I take a different view.
When will you waken up?
It is high time!
Why is this?
The people have spoken.
The European Council must listen.
We must have a referendum.
That is the problem.
That is just an illusion!
Europe is a model of prosperity!
That is surely undeniable.
Is it still functioning?
What are its interim findings?
When can we expect any?
It has already announced some plans.
It can lead to protectionism.
Only then will they be viable.
That is not the case.
Lithuania has already experienced this.
Instead, let us do less!
I have another example.
Put your money where your mouth is.
There is nothing new in that of course.
We need to address that.
Where is the other third?
We have to focus on action.
Let me stress several policy issues.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This, to me, is the ticking time bomb.
I fear that this is a mistaken view.
This is now a common area.
Thank you.
People must at least ask for the floor.
(Interjection from Martin Schulz)
These are the three primary topics.
Now a brief word about the main topics.
There cannot be any doubt about that.
I am convinced that that is not true.
I wish them all the best.
We now have to implement them.
That is the issue.
Some of you mentioned the Laval case.
Let us therefore resist this tendency.
We want competitive European industry.
That is the difference!

Oral explanations of vote
Firstly, I believe in tax competition.
I understand that.
Now, let us talk about tax competition.
(PL) Mr President, I voted against.
That is the highest figure for Europe.
Written explanations of vote
Portugal is also taking part.
That is a very positive trend.
I voted in favour of this report.
Hence our vote against.
In this context:
Our objective can be achieved.
So I support the report.
I endorse the report.
I therefore abstain in the vote.
I have voted in favour of the report.

Armenia
That is the challenge.
There are energy resources.
The debate is closed.
2.
Russia
We are just the opposite!
(Applause)
Unfortunately, we do.
Mr President, I have to disappoint you.
This is the rule of law?
(NL) Just two points.
So let us be under no illusions.
Why financial difficulties?

In fact, the opposite is the case.
Both aspects are essential.
Let me conclude with an appraisal.
This was a Council of normality.
Thank you very much for your attention.
(Applause)


You cannot have one without the other.
(Applause)
An important step was taken in Bali.
That is good news.
Can we expect any additional proposals?
This is a defiance of democracy.
I do not believe so.
We need to adopt alternative policies.
I intend to continue my political work.
We have achieved a great deal.
The Council has still not learnt.
(SK) Thank you, Mr President.
We welcome that.
We will be keeping an eye on that.
Firstly on carbon capture and storage.
The second point is about biofuels.
You mentioned it three times.
We all need to remember that.
The answer is: it does not!
Where is the engine for our economy?
Can we do this in Europe?
There are no adjustment mechanisms.
I support all of this.
I have just one comment.
I want to make one more common on this.
The language must be revised.
A huge omission.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
I suggest we continue in this vein.
Wakey-wakey!
How can we help our economy, then?
Thank you.
Nonetheless, I must contradict him.
That is the message we want to convey.
Thank you for your attention.
This is indeed a serious concern.
This is true.
We never said it would be an easy task.
I think that is quite obvious.
A lot has to be done at national level.

It is currently murdering Tibetans.

ENP partnership rewards progress.
This is true.
However, that is not nearly enough.
(FR) The debate is closed.
Things will then be on the right track.
This is a perfectly justified concern.
This is a fine aim, a good aim.
Let us give it our support.
We have not yet reached that point.
There is not much time to waste.
I believe this to be fundamental.
Thank you, Mr President.
This is a very good report.
Thank you.
(SV) Thank you, Mr President.
The report is good throughout.
The law entitles us to do so'.
I urge you to support the report.
What we now need is a success story.
However, we still need to name names.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Both reports are excellent.
Why not go one step further?
(SV) Thank you, Madam President.
I congratulate him on it.
This must not happen!
Very few of these ideas were realised.
It makes me optimistic.
There is no politics without symbolism.
(SK) I will be very brief.
This course should be continued.
Thank you.
Sustained efforts are needed.

Why has Croatia been successful?

Croatia's GDP growth is at 6 percent.

Some find much to celebrate; I do not.
Why?
Why?
Not only off Bulgaria but off itself.
These abuses are continuing.
Then Bulgaria and Romania joined too.
That concludes the one-minute speeches.
Some actions are already under way.
Take colorectal cancer, for instance.
Thank you.
The numbers are shocking.

I have heard very interesting comments.

Thank you, Commissioner.
This change has already happened.
That is simply a myth.
Firstly, is global warming happening?
Secondly, is it caused by mankind?
Thirdly, can we make a difference?
It will be hugely damaging.
Thank you.
At present, we really do not know.
These countries are directly involved.
Along with water goes soil.
But have you backed the wrong horse?
They were bioclimatic houses.

Man-made climate change is inexcusable.
Today we humans have burrowed deep.
Do not build on flood plains.
Plant deciduous forests.
Shore up endangered coastlines.
(ES) Thank you, Mr President.
Eighteen per cent!
He is quite right.
This is not sustainable.
That is why Europe must act now.
This will be the key to success.
So we do need to be careful on this.
Let us be sensible in this debate.
Look at India.
We have a problem.
Half of our land is below sea level.
We want to keep going down this route.
It has always paid off.
Why do we have emissions?

Our answer to these questions is 'no'.

Serbia is not moving towards Europe.
Thank you.
We will miss his voice.
May he rest in peace.
The answer is 'not really'.

Thank you.
It was an impressive event.
Why do you not let me have my say?
You are not entered in my list.
That concludes this item.
We have heard about those just now.
We have to work towards that.
Thank you for your kind attention.
We must not ignore this.
I welcome what the Commissioner said.
That is most important.
There are three aspects here.
We are supposed to have equal powers.
Sorting that out has to be a priority.
It relates to the Baltic Sea Strategy.
Thank you for your attention.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
This is not simply our moral duty.
It is in our own interests.
Thank you very much.

Thank you very much for the debate.
Let me also thank the Commissioner.
For that, I warmly thank all concerned.
That is wonderful!
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
This is an important moral issue.
I quote:
The perpetrator was not Hitler.
We can only applaud it.
We reject that view.
I think that the debate was pithy.
We are talking about EU citizens.
Thank you.
So, what do we need to do?
An unbelievable paradox, indeed.

Poland may serve as an example.

I thank you on his behalf.
This must be made quite clear.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
That attitude must be changed.
We only advanced bit by bit.
Why do you need all of this?
To tackle organised crime?
That is a lie!

We really do need fundamental changes.

It has taken several months.
Iraq is simply one example.
It is a positive one.
We have done well.
The list of complaints was endless.
I said this in the committee.
The committee still voted to discharge.
I can do so with a clear conscience.
Most of you cannot.

However, here it has been cut out!
Responsible action this is not.'

It must be integrated in the budget!
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much for that, too.
Quite to the contrary!
I utterly abhor this scandal-mongering.
There we do have some doubts.

The report had never been so good.
No, we can do much better.
The national declarations.
What does the Commission say?
This is too much.

That is, of course, absolute nonsense.
Naturally this would not be possible.
How can there be no transparency?
There are different types of agencies.
This is not true!
This really is a great stride forward.

I am pretty sure it is 'global'.
Sadly this was to no avail.
I find that quite upsetting.
Perhaps he did not know who I was.
Thank you very much, Mr Fatuzzo.
Written explanations of vote
This is good.
Will it be some kind of 'Big Brother'?
Why should this be?

'Do what I say, not what I do'...
This cannot be allowed to continue.

What is the Commission doing?
Where do the reasons for this lie?

We do not hear enough about this.
They are right to do so.
This is far from being the case.
Let us open our eyes.
Remember the old US policy?
There are many explanatory factors.

Many lay the blame on biofuels.
What are our responsibilities?
We need to end all this, he says.
Will we listen to him?

He is right.
We cannot have it both ways.
But let me go to the developing world.
But do not kick the CAP!
I do not believe so.
This is a vital aspect.
The causes have mostly been covered.
The money issue will be resolved.
We need to invest in training.
I think that applies here too.
Reality verified this policy.
Be more ambitious on car efficiency.
We have many good tools available.
This did not solve the problem, though.
Why, then, are we waiting?
Such is capitalism.
There is a solution.
We cannot do much about that.
We cannot do much about that.
We have to grow biofuels sustainably.
This could have been foreseen.
We should not be shocked by this.
They are going to need a lot more food.
That is the key!
Set-aside must be removed.
No, we do not.
This is bizarre.
There is something very wrong there.
We have to turn our attention to this.
Thank you for your attention.
But this is not enough!
Perhaps we do not have to look too far.
Where are they now?
They are all gone.
The truth is that it has come upon us.
We must now respond to it.
Both clash.
Two years ago I received 8 cents.
What should we do?
But what can we do about this?
The main reason is greater demand.
Increasing supplies.
More about this later.
Now a word or two about biofuels.
I should like to add something else.
Thank you again for this debate.
There is not one single cause.
Take biofuels, for example.
I do not accept that.
What would happen to world poverty?
We must be reasonable.
It is intellectually rational.
There is my answer.
Even I have to say it.
I think this has to be said.
This subject is not closed.
I too wish to be pragmatic.
Thank you for this debate.

My welcome too, Commissioner.
Is this not unlikely, Commissioner?
It is nice to have her with us.
Thank you for your reply.
We have already waited far too long.
Let us not speak about the past.
That concludes Question Time.
We have gained increased mobility.
One million people!
Again, I would say no.
This is the way forward!
Thank you.
This was the R√ºffert ruling.
This is quite simply unacceptable.
My conclusion is therefore clear.
This is unacceptable.
This too is unacceptable.
That is the fundamental question.
This is TNT's interpretation.
EC law must therefore be changed.
This is completely unacceptable.
The Court has spoken.
That is for the Commission to do.
Thank you.
It no longer applies today.
I do not know in detail.
We have to check all this.
This is not discrimination.
The alternative is social dumping.
This is a downward spiral.
I welcome this.
It is even essential.
It is purely a propaganda term.
I would appeal for calm.
Let us take a calm approach to this.
I am warning against this.
(ET) Mr President, colleagues.

Written statements (Rule 142)
It was not.
I share your opinion on this subject.
We are both major partners of Africa.
Take the case of Liberia for example.
Nowhere!
This pains me on a daily basis.
I somehow doubt it.
There is some basis for this.
This is not true.
Evidently I share your assessment.
The same can be said today.
We have to be realistic about this.
The figures speak for themselves.
Who can blame it?
For this I will continue in Polish.
I am putting it bluntly - exploit.
Africa needs saving from this.
We must not give up, however.
I pray to God that we can achieve this.
We now have a choice.
That is why this report is so timely.
This practical case is Zimbabwe.
From China.
Loaded with what?
China is also our partner in the WTO.
Africa and China need Europe.
It is really quite amazing.
It can do this in two ways.
That is a fact.
What advantage do we have?
I am not explaining myself properly.
No, they are honest.
We must not dismiss this aspect.
There is no miracle solution.
That is what I wanted to say.
One final thing, for what it is worth.
Zimbabwe was obviously on the agenda.
This is very positive.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Thank you for your attention.
Firstly, the African Peace Facility.
The question is, do we have the will?'

No, it will not!
The first relates to the hostages.
I should like to say a word about Cuba.

This is extremely important.

We are thus relying on you.
(LV) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
Where is the problem?
- (MT) Thank you, Mr President.
In short, a poor result.
Thank you for your attention.
This is entirely untrue.
We should prevent this from happening.
Is that not our top priority?
Certain principles have been studied.
I must stress that.

Situation in Burma (debate)
You do not need to live in a bunker.


What is to be done?
How do we move forward?
No!
That is the only way we can get change.
I support this motion for a resolution.
Both were once thriving economies.
Very, very little.
I say we must be much more robust.
Firstly, Mr Cappato.
My inclination is towards the latter.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
How can Frontex undertake to do this?
Is that what we want on our land?
Certainly not.
Where are these applications examined?
We have to send a clear message.
Most of them are not.
The problem is thus a persistent one.
Can Frontex solve the problem, however?
I have my doubts.
We certainly need to reinforce Frontex.
Cyprus is a case in point.
My country is doing its level best.
Frontex was established five years ago.
Are we pleased with its results?
They travel for thousands of miles.
These people come because we need them.
What are we doing then?
That is totally unacceptable.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)

Thank you.
However, more efforts are needed.
They can be summarised in seven points.
This could weaken our credibility.
COP 9 will help to ensure this.


We could turn this trend around.
I would like to highlight three areas.
Market policy will be upheld there too.
It is a very poorly understood concept.
2010 - how are you!
Let us be honest with one another.
The final point concerns GMOs.
Unfortunately, it is not only Germany!
(The President cut off the speaker)
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
We need a package.
So far that has not happened.
This is a challenge for us all.
You asked about financial resources.
Sometimes we forget about that.
I thank you for that.
We have them.
That is what I can say in general.
I will not take more time.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.

Question Time (Council)
They spent many years preparing for it.
We were crammed into a bus.
It took 22 minutes.
I joke not.
Explain please, Minister!
The Lisbon Treaty does not change that.
How very true.
Therefore, the answer is simple.
What action should we take?
(SL) You are right, Mr Burke.
That concludes Question Time.


Such nonsense should not be tolerated.
These are not two separate things.
We have to toe the line.
That is not exclusive trade.

Open trade has to be fair.
That order made nations prosperous.
Today, however, social dumping reigns.

This is a reality check.
They are completely unsupported.
There is no excuse for this.
We have got to speed things up.
This is the politics of the madhouse.
Talk about unfair competition!
It refers to existing legislation.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The big question is why.
I think it is time to do it now.
There is also another point.
What is the point of that?
What is the explanation?
Can we simply do this?
The first of these is public health.
The second area is the environment.
Europe is not hungry at present.
Not as far as I am concerned.
I am not the only one to protest.
Many citizens are worried about GMOs.
We have to resist that fiercely.
It sounds like zero sense to me.
Science cannot and must not be stopped.
Thank you for your attention.
So it is better to be safe than sorry.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
GMOs are detrimental to public health.

Documents received: see Minutes
That is the aim.
This report is very important.
One is paragraph 26.
It is inconsistent.
That is not something we can support.
I see two courses of action.
I simply do not understand this.
Let me first make a personal comment.
We need more political control.
We need more planning.
That was in the early 1990s.
Of course this is entirely correct.
It is within their field of competence.
We really cannot wait any longer!
Let us do so!
This would appear to be insufficient.
Just like all taxes, they are disliked.
Appalling!
Individual countries do matter.
We should call a spade a spade.
We must keep this fact in mind.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
This subject warrants intensive debate.
We support that objective.
Why are individuals appointed?
Is it about regional balance?
Is it about inter-sector balance?
Who sets the agenda?
What a marvellous answer!
One of our aims is convergence.
Let me therefore focus on three points.
I agree.
The third point is financing.
How are these bodies to be financed?
This cannot be acceptable.
Why is it needed?
What will it do?
This is very welcome.
Thank you for this worthwhile debate!
Only then should we make our decision.
The idea is a good one.
It is not needed.
Mr Mitchell made an interesting point.
We will not have difficulties then.
I should like to pick up on two things.
That is the first point.

How can we achieve this?
I am drawing to a close, Mr President.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
The euro has protected us.
But this success has strings attached.
This is true within the EU.
If it is a good one, we will be there.
Very well!
It has proved to be a stable currency.
Further steps must follow.
That would be completely unacceptable.
Independent from what?
We will leave you to ponder the answer.

The second topic is restructuring.
It is high time this happened.

Thank you very much.
Improvements are needed.
The Commission must act.
This must not be!
I know that it is not easy for you.
There has never been such a phase.
You could have done the same.
It is a lot of nonsense.

Well, firstly a positive one.

Business as usual.

Burma's borders must be opened.
Many thanks Mr Cappato.
Thank you for your attention.
(NL) Thank you, Mr President.
Constant education is needed for this.
There is no other way out.
I have a few other points.

Take India and China.
Both countries we are wooing for trade.
Little wonder things are not improving.
So that is the sad score in Russia.
The Russian people deserve more.
This is not Kremlin-bashing.
The EU still has to be much stronger.
Let us turn to face them.
In Europe every person should be safe.
Thank you, Mrs Jukneviƒçienƒó.
It has one very serious fault, however.
We could say these things last year.
Are things improving for the Dalits?
(ES) Mr President, thank you very much.
None.
Again, none.
Not so.
The Union is a unity based on values.
That, however, is not enough.
Maybe whatever.
We must find the solution together.
Thank you, Minister.

Yes, I will be as brief as possible.
I am very disappointed by Amendment 3.
I would like to underline one point.
I cannot say 'you must be registered'.
It takes two to tango.
Focus on other groups.
However, the footprint is legislative.
You must be unaware of this.
Their work is important.
In our view, this is long overdue.
If they can do it, why cannot we?
Thank you, Mr Bonde.
(DE) I will now continue in German.
How should we deal with them?
I do hope not!
Amendment 3 has already been mentioned.
That is good.
That is the position of our group.

It must be a fair and honest process.
Firstly, how do we deal with the issue?
Voluntary registration is not enough.
That imbalance affects our legislation.
That will enable us to have a balance.
This is all possible.

Written explanation of vote



The Commission's position is clear.
That is why I shall vote against.

We therefore voted against the report.
This has never happened in history.
This should be our common concern.
In North America it is less than 5%.
I voted in favour of the report.
I will not contribute to this.


I voted in favour of the report.
That is what has happened.

That is a fallacy.


The political debate needs to continue.
To be continued ...
We agree.


This can only be deplored.
I do not think so, quite the contrary.
We cannot accept that.


We therefore voted against it.

I voted in support of the report.
Misleading 'Directory companies' (e.g.
'European City Guides') (debate)

And what do we get from the Council?
What are people meant to do?
Now there is a thought.
We must close loopholes.
This is not acceptable.
But I repeat the point.
That could happen straight away.
So that is your first task.
It will not take very much to do.
The information is there.
It is not a difficult thing to do.
So that is three things you should do.
Everybody knows that is the case.
It would not take much to do.
We need firm action on this.
We need it soon.
Not all Member States do it.
Let me start by making one thing clear.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
A rapid agreement is possible.
Therefore, I cannot support it.
Should I be doing this indefinitely?
This is ultimately the key question.
I believe the regulation is clear.
There is not a vast amount of work.
Do not come to me with conditions!
There are still six years to go.
Here we must simply draw clear lines.
We must make a statutory ruling.
That is excellent.
They make no sense at all.
This is a case that requires a remedy.'
Road cabotage has become a reality.'
What does the Commission say now?
What is it that we are doing, then?
Congratulations!
I hope that these make it through.
Otherwise, none of it will work.

We will just have to wait and see.


Naturally, we need a European approach.
It is not always easy.
The same applies to the cabotage rules.
What is the EU all about?
So we have to say 'yes' to the future.
The joint debate is closed.
Situation of the Roma in Italy (debate)
I would like to highlight something.
Why does this situation exist?
Romanians are citizens of the Union.

Thank you.

What we must not do is deny the facts.
As I said, we are not do-gooders.

It must defend everyone.
This is ridiculous.
It is always somebody else's fault.
It is high time for action.

Romanians and Roma are only victims.
Italians are also victims.
We do not need confrontation.

Question Time (Commission)
You will remember the 35% discussion.
It is vital that this is a key focus.
We have had higher energy costs.
Thank you, Commissioner.
So, why is 'Debate Europe' not working?
We cannot be too cautious.
I very much hope...
I will speak in English.
This is what they want to know.
How can we be more effective?
Two points.
That concludes Question Time.
Composition of Parliament: see Minutes
She did it!
We are aware of the compromise.

Thank you for this exemplary work!
The debate is closed.
Women and science (debate)
The report has constructive ideas.
That is too prescriptive.
I greatly welcome that.
Thank you very much, Mr Dover.
I have only female speakers.
Thank you for doing this.
Why is this?
Inequality pervades society.
Equal rights are human rights!
So why is this the case?
I consider this alarming.
Women could close this gap.
We must demand political action now.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.

¬∑ The scope of the export ban.
¬∑ The date of its entry into force.
However, two specific issues were not.
We are now deciding to ban its export.
To begin with, some criticism.
But a compromise is a compromise.
No more than that.
Yet it is a huge amount of mercury.
Many molecules, in fact.
I cannot agree with this opinion.
We must safeguard this achievement.
Perhaps they will do so in writing.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Social standards do not apply here.
I do not agree with this.
That is in any case a good start.
Many of these ships were from the EU.
Yet it is now the end of May 2008.
The use of child labour is also common.
The equation is a difficult one.
This would solve the equation.
This is the process we are commencing.
We must also tackle that issue.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.

A very warm welcome to you.

It is about focusing on the facts.
We have read many excellent documents.
What, then, do we need to do in future?
That is the great opportunity.
We need the courage to be creative.
(Applause)
Now, in 2008, it is time for action.
Now the debate is over.
I now turn to the UN negotiations.
Let me not beat about the bush.
We have an immense responsibility here.
Europe is an industrial continent.
(Applause)
It is not rocket science.

Mr Florenz's report is a good report.
It is going to cost us.
As I have said, we should go further.
Such policies will not save the planet.
Thank you, Mrs Bobo≈°√≠kov√°.
Thank you, Madam.
What does this mean?
Mr President, I agree with Mr Pƒôk.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(NL) I would like to thank Mr Florenz.
He has produced an excellent report.
That is no easy task.
There are important interests involved.
Two things are therefore important.
There are only 18 months to go.
We need cleaner fuels and cleaner cars.
They have been heard in this House too.
We are the decision-makers.
This is no cause for elation, however.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you for your attention.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.

We cannot go along with that.
Mr Swoboda has said enough about that.
The European Union can also do more.

They will defend it with their bodies.
Thank you.
The Union must honour its commitments.
Violence cannot be met with violence.

I emphasise three points.

The EU's credibility is at stake here.

Thank you.
They are based on faith not fact.
What will that lead to?
How will my constituents respond?
I will tell you how they will respond.
They will say: 'What nonsense is this?
That proved impossible.
Thank you for your understanding.
However, this is not the case.
The opposing camp is also important.
In every case, we move on from them.
We cannot bear this burden on our own.
We probably cannot stop it altogether.
End of story!
Mr Posselt has already made this point.
Written explanations of vote
We should meet at a single location.
I voted in favour of the report.
Does hypocrisy have no limits?
Profit is everything.
in writing. ?
I therefore chose to abstain.
This is not my interpretation.
in writing. ?
There are objective data for all this.
I therefore voted for the report.
This is why I voted against the report.
We will await this future report.
It therefore has my support.
This is institutionalised repentance.
Tragic situation in Burma (debate)
The situation is still critical.
We had requested one month.
There is a risk of epidemics.
There is also a risk of famine.
I must tell you it is no rapid process.
We were given a two-week extension.
I asked to be informed regularly.
That was how the mission went.
The United Nations has to act.
That impresses me.
Enough is enough, patience has run out.
That is what we want.
We are not neutral.
This is not really the problem.
This is a fact.
They are laughing at us all.
These are actions verging on genocide.
What is the responsible approach?
Absolutely!
Do they really work?
There is no time to lose!

What is he seeking to achieve?
I shall list just a few.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.

Natural disaster in China (debate)
This truly is a disaster.
Thank you.
Yet how long can it hold out?
Why was that?
I can fully endorse that.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for your attention.
We cannot react otherwise.
It is our moral duty to help.
We simply have to do so.
We should do so most emphatically.
This will make things very clear.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the debate on:

I shall be grateful for your response.
That is unacceptable.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you.
Their destructive power is enormous.
They have an impact on people's health.
They kill without mercy.
This process will take years.
I am glad that we are holding it today.
DU munitions have long-term effects.
The problem is plain to see.
Take action.
Thank you.
I do wish to make this clear.
I am quite in favour of this point.
This is perhaps what you were seeking.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.

There is only one boat.

Thank you.
Thank you.
That was our first mistake.
Your comment is noted.
Thank you.
That concludes Question Time.
So, what is of genuine importance?
Thank you.
I ask you to support this plan.
Our task is not to protect industries.
It covers everything that it should.
The first is innovation.
We all know this is a difficult issue.
I am very grateful to her.
We cooperated well on this report.
We are a vibrant global force.
Yet what does that mean?
We must do a lot more.
The three Ts need more money.
The clusters are a sound initiative.
We must take care to act consistently.
They fool no one, however.
It is obvious it is not the ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
I should like to make that very clear.
All this increases costs.
How can this be achieved?
Is it even possible?
That is the problem.
Thank you.

rapporteur. ?
A new approach is required too.
A longer time period is needed.
(The speaker continued in English)
Only then can we check properly.
That is where the problem lies.
The first one is this.
In 2008 the figure was only 30%.
Food safety is a priority issue.
Thank you for your attention.
This is an area which needs tidying up.
I fully agree with that.
I am entirely behind that.
This is a most fundamental point.
It has already been addressed.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
First of all, the time constraints.
Now let me turn to budgets.
Thank you very much for your support.
This stands to reason.
Today's debate makes that quite clear.
We cannot condone double standards.
That is simply unacceptable.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Thank you, Mr President.
Are there any objections?

That is a crucial point.
Let us be honest.
But we have to look things in the face.
The EU must not be a closed club.
My thanks go the rapporteur.
Hardly democratic.
(SV) Thank you, Madam President.
It is a good basic position.
That is important.
That dialogue took place.
The debate is closed.
It is not a technical debate.
Accra is not a technical meeting.
The battle is far from won.
The Commission cannot act alone.
I agree almost 100% with it.
The first is aid predictability.
You are quite right!
We ask a lot of our delegations.
That is my first point.
Aid must be aid.
Time is running out for Africa.
We have to get aid back on track.
These are not two conflicting concepts.
That is our strength!
I congratulate him.
The report has come at the right time.
So we have a big responsibility.
Everyone must realise that.
There is indeed room for optimism.
That was not the intention!
In 2007 the level of EU aid decreased.
However, life is not that simple.
We have a post-colonial past.
(Applause)
Three points.
I say and I repeat: that is not true!
For my part, I am not in favour.
The tools exist.
We need to reform the WFP, but how?
I spoke of that recently.
It is a major problem.
It is important to remember that.
That is what I want to say to you.
I can tell you it is no joke.
He was quite right.
There are limits.
I want no more procedure.
That is another example!
I also agree that we need more.
That project is making good progress.
Technically, it has been finalised.
We worked with the World Bank.
You know the reply.
Firstly, I have already replied.
I can suggest but I cannot impose.
That is more or less true.
I often point it out at meetings.
I think I have covered everything now.
The aid needs to be more predictable.

Thank you for coming, Mr Solana.


We support him in that.
Those reports ask for more efficiency.
It has to be respected in full.
I am doing that.
The strategy has proved very useful.
I think we would agree on that.

An important decision was taken.
Let me start with the Western Balkans.
Let me say a word about Kosovo.
I am going to Georgia tomorrow morning.
I will also visit Abkhazia.
He is in charge of the government now.
I have not been there since June 2006.

United we stand, divided we fall.
We have the choice.
That is what Europe needs.
Thank you for your attention.
We should listen to their demands.
I would like to mention two matters.
This is not acceptable!

(Applause)
What happens to our credibility then?
We believe that this is wrong.
This is long overdue.
We do not want a military alliance.
We want a civil European Union.
And what ambitions they are.
We need members of the police there.
Therefore, I agree with that.
However, take the example of Chad.
I was in Chad a couple of weeks ago.

That is not yet the case in many areas.
That is the broad agenda.
I completely agree with this.
Thank you.
Welcome

This is therefore a difficult task.
The evidence is conclusive.
The EU is now to represent us all.

Thank you very much.
Fisheries have a future.
That is fair enough.



That concludes this item.
He has asked me to speak on his behalf.

We need a certain strictness here.
America is also dissatisfied.

I think for example of Vietnam.
At the moment Vietnam falls below 50%.
It is after all only 3.5%.

This should not be an isolated process.
I know Peter a bit better.
It will indeed get them somewhere.

Let me be clear today.


How can we tackle this problem?
There are three possible ways.
How can this be achieved?
I simply wish to remind you of this.
This is not right!
Secondly, customer information.
This is not right!
That in itself will bring down prices.

Let us also talk about oil and gas.
We do not need another.
Our resolution makes no mistake.
There was no misplaced initiative.
The Mediterranean is a lake.
Why did you distance yourself from it?
No, we must not confuse things.
Is that not a little too little?

Do we want more?
Do we want better standards?
The case of detention...
Are they really all that great?
That is not the case.
We are at first reading.
Do we want justified decisions?
Thank you Madam President.
We have stated our position on this.
The answer is no.
Is it the one we wanted?
Certainly not!
Again, the answer is no.
The answer is yes, it is.
We must, however, face reality.
I think not.
Do you know why?
This is not true.
Here is where we wish to make progress.
The restrictions are very strict.
Is not a question of whether it is.
It is.
So we need to take the first step.
So what is being decided here today?
No extreme position will be adopted.
This is a cornerstone of democracy.
We have withdrawn our amendments.
I understand that they are not happy.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
This was not easy to achieve.
The euro was never an end in itself.
What are the next specific steps?
Commissioner ≈†pidla spoke about this.
Mr Radwan is absolutely right.

It is truly a Slovakian miracle.
Last year growth even exceeded 10%.
Everyone knows the result.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mr President, I rise on Rule 103(2).

(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
But this is a good report.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Now it is the turn of the Council.
Thank you very much.
The question is what we do about it.
That is what we should do.
(Applause)
Nevertheless, I wish this country well.
Written explanations of vote
These targets are ambitious.

These views are reflected in my vote.

It is a shame.
Hence our abstention.

This will ensure the following:
So, who is resisting this?


That is not self-evident.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Are they functioning well enough?
It lost by a narrow margin in the vote.
We want to do something about this.
This is Parliament's wish.
It is not a basic principle.
The sooner this is done, the better.
Thank you for your attention.
Who knows?
That is how things are.
We have to stop fearing nuclear power.


(The President cut off the speaker)
The EU institutions were not required.
Now you must respect their decision.
Is there more investment in Spain?
The world has changed for ever.
Thank you for your attention.
We must accept and respect this.
I think this is wonderful.
Thank you.
(Applause).
Many Members have spoken about this.
This is not the way to go!
That is a fallacy.
I do not make any concessions here.
We are in favour of unbundling.

Allow me to make some other points.
The Agency will be no paper tiger.
This is also the wish of the Council.
Let us start with the Agency.
I have some doubts.
Both sides are ready.

Commission Question Time

These duties need to be examined.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(LT) My question concerns excise duty.
So could you enlighten us about that?
Let me also make the following point.


The primary cost is self-evident.
Do you agree with this assessment?
At the moment there is no legal basis.
That is all that we can say at present.
I thank the Commissioner for his reply.
That is all that I can tell you.
That concludes Question Time.
Composition of Parliament : see Minutes
Import of poultry carcases (debate)
First, one single substance is applied.
Why such unanimity?
This pressure is of an economic nature.
My country, Poland, is one of them.
One food scandal follows another.
Secondly, it is an industrial decision.
A good trade deal must also be fair.
Finally, it is a political decision.
(SV) Thank you, Mr President.
None of this is acceptable.
The debate is closed.
This is another important innovation.
It is!
Ireland, of course, is no exception.
Thank you very much!
Yet that is what we want, is it not?
Thank you very much.
It really puts the Union on the map.
Therefore, the real number is higher.
How much does it cost?

Thank you all for your cooperation.
Vehicles must remain affordable.
That is our responsibility.

Both these issues are very important.
Why?
I wholeheartedly agree.
There is one point I must dispute.
Most of us use vehicles on these roads.
However, as always, there is a 'but'.
She has chosen the right approach.


Therefore, I congratulate all involved.
There are many arguments in favour.
Today we understand each other better.
This is what these systems do.
The incremental cost is much lower.
That is what this is all about.
The technology is widely available.
The sector is therefore committed.
Let us therefore take action.
This is a serious problem.
The second aspect is information.
This has several important aspects.
It is about less risk, more safety.

Let us therefore work together.
Let us not miss our chance.
Thank you for your attention.

Explanations of vote
I was trying to attract your attention.
It certainly should be voluntary.
Now we have got nothing.
We have got electronic tagging.
The industry cannot afford it.
Quite the contrary in fact.
Hence our vote against the report.
Deeds and not words.
Action and not promises.
That is an unacceptable situation.
The EU did not turn a blind eye.
Let us not relax our demands.
Four characteristics come to mind.
These reports are unequivocal.
The Burmese junta uses brutal violence.
China must stop supporting Burma.
The results?
The humanitarian emergency is not over.
They deserve better.
We continue a balanced approach.

Thank you very much.
This is the true face of today's EU.
We must not forget this!
Thank you.
The campaign is of course continuing.
Thank you very much.
(HU) Thank you.
Thank you.
We must pursue this issue.
What are we concerned with here?
The title tells all.
(Applause)
Take the example of Palestine.
What are we going to do next year?
Dip into the flexibility instrument?
Reduce a margin that is already small?
For the short term, there is food aid.
Better effects, better results.
This is the way to convince people.
This is an increase of five percent.
A suitable budget is needed for this.

Thank you for your kind attention.
No, they cannot.
I am only asking.
It is a real mess.
(Applause)
(Applause)
On the first point, what can we do?
What does the report say?
I shall focus on two examples.
Another aspect is budget heading 5.

So this debate is grotesque.
However, I do not agree.


Thank you.
Thank you very much for your attention.
That includes Mr Ferrari.
This does not appear to have been done.
There is a need to manage a problem.
Roma have become partners!
Why reinvent the wheel?
Then too, it all began with a census.
What use will be made of these data?
Roma are today European citizens.
Nothing has been done.
Now the situation is worse.
Now brown seems to be turning to black.
It is more substantial.
The measures concern everyone.
No database has been set up.
And we all saw to what that leads.
Italy will not succeed either.
(Protests)
I am sorry, Mr Susta.
What is going on?
Please leave the Chamber.
That is the correct way to proceed.
Help is indicated here.
We have to do more - we shall do more!
It is a problem of politics.
The challenge is on.
It is unreasonable to expect more.
There are three things we must hold to.

This is not true.
He had no objections and he agreed.

Written statements (Rule 142)
So there are things to be glad about.

Thank you, therefore, to Mr Corbett.
That is what you have done here.
You have violated this taboo.
What is being said here is fraudulent.
The current state of affairs is fine.
Mr President, let us face facts.
We need to ask why.
Only the voters have such a right.
This is totally undemocratic.
Why not?
What about Mr Voggenhuber?
Shame on you!
Do not be the 'anti-Europeans'.
This method is perfect.
What utter nonsense!
This is a modest proposal.
So why not here?
This proposal is not a radical one.
The debate is closed.
And who should judge this?
Thank you.
Therefore, we must set priorities.
That is a good innovation.
Thank you very much.

Censorship?
So we have catered for that.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.

That is positive.
We cannot agree to this.
Thank you.
I appeal to Parliament to support them.
That gas comes from Russia.
Let Europe remain our priority.

(The President cut off the speaker.)
Who will be held responsible?
(The President cut off the speaker)
This pipeline is over 1 000 km long.
Even worse: it is undemocratic.
We must be honest enough to admit it.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
There are, however, many uncertainties.
It really is in a bad way.
That was your decision, not mine!
I hope it will ratify it.
(Applause)
This was raised here.
Please treat this as a warning.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 p.m.
The question arises - who benefits?
Afghanistan is at a crossroads.
To say what?
Nothing is going well!
Yesterday's attack showed that.
This should be supported.


I will just make three remarks.
The first is on Pakistan.
This is my first remark.
My second remark is on justice.

There is no question of that.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
Written statements (Rule 142)
That is our ambition.
This is not on.
We are provoking a trade war here.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I will mention only two points.
Thank you.
Here in the EU we fly as never before.
What are we going to take a lead on?
This is an agreement on aviation.
We want to work on shipping as well.
(LV) Thank you, Madam President.
If we really...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
(NL) Is this a perfect agreement?
No.
Is this a step in the right direction?
Absolutely.
Only then will we achieve real results.
(Applause)
(Applause)
I do not believe this was the case.
Then we will all be working together.

Explanations of vote
That is very regrettable.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
We must halt climate change.
I welcome the limit on exemptions.
That is wrong!
Yet the opposite is being claimed.
That is for bureaucrats.
The problem is that we do not use it.
I regret this profoundly.
Why?
Let their voice stand.

Who will earn from this?
This is not what is happening today.
Yes, they are in Afghanistan.

I recognise that it is not easy.
I do not know what the solution is.

That would be a big mistake.
Working in the dockyards is dangerous.
This is a second reading decision.
I voted in favour of the report.
The aviation sector is expanding.
I voted in favour of the report.

This cannot become the norm.

This is an important report.
Why?
We have a lot to do in a short time.
in writing. - I abstained on this vote.
I would see it differently.
The next item is the joint debate on
Security of supply is also important.
You have asked for a stronger Agency.
We have to invest more and better.


It has certainly not been easy.
I shall be brief.
That is not always the case.
This is a key decision.
It is all about reducing energy costs.
I will keep it short.
That is our aim.
I doubt it.
That is especially important.

What are Mr Reul and others proposing?
Just these very things!
But you are behind the times.
And all that is under our feet.
By whom, exactly?
In short, it is all about control.
Is that what they call solidarity?



Thank you all for your attention.

We all share responsibility for this.
The first concerns long-term contracts.
(LV) Thank you, Mr President.
The answer is very easy: they are not.
Do not delay until October.
We need to start now.
The work is not complete, however.
That is fine, but it is not enough.
Absolutely not!

(Applause)
However, we should also be cautious.

(HU) Just a few things in brief.
And everybody must take this seriously.
Thank you.

The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
Thank you for your reply.
However, Mr Crowley is certainly right.
The work is beginning in the Council.


I wonder what his views are on that.
I have two questions.
That would be a very good start.
Mr Rack is quite right in that regard.

Could he make a comment on that please?
That is my belief.
We know that not everything is easy.
That concludes Question Time.
The next item is the joint debate on
Both are, therefore, very good reports.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
We hope so.
It is far more than that though.
That is a great step forwards.
The debate is closed.
A third issue is accompanying measures.
Let us now come to the report.
That is what subsidiarity is all about.
There are accidents everywhere.
I have a couple of criticisms, however.
This does not seem a good idea to me.
We cannot afford that.
Everything.
What has it been hitherto?
Nothing.

I think that is extremely urgent.
We need a European solution.
I ask you: when will we have it?

It is a pleasure for me to do so.
There are three very clear questions.
There is no other option.
That needs to be clarified.
That is the information I received.
That is important.
What are you doing in the interim?
There is a positive solution.
How will you deal with that?

Closure of the sitting
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)
Opening of the sitting
(The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)
I will not elaborate on that.
National influence has to be prevented.
Unlimited independence is needed.
I hope it can.
I have three wishes.
Two of them have already been granted.
I believe that is now happening.
That too is already in the offing.
Why?
That was the 20th century world.
That is the deep-seated crisis.
So I have three specific questions.
First, speculation.
This could lead to double standards.
I believe the opposite to be true.
Therefore, we have to reflect on this.
But is this story being sold?
I think it also achieved this.
But the risks are high.
A final note.
I am glad that the ECB is independent.
But the Treaty says nothing about this.
The ECB has proved its worth.
That is to be welcomed.
That is bad news.
Slovakia was a warning sign for me.
I mentioned price-setters.
There is absolutely no ambiguity there.
Not all French people do that.
(Applause)
Let me give you some examples.
These are no longer good times.
We have stated that several times.

And we are keen to encourage that.
That is not right.
This subject has a long history.
These reports reveal another way.
Is everything really simplified now?
I have my doubts.
I think we ought to reflect on that.
This is not about harmonisation.
We have had coordination before.
It had its shortcomings.
That is important.

But the Chinese people are afraid.
We know that this has not happened.
Nor indeed a Burma.
It is very serious.
We have this human rights dialogue.
This is what we are trying to do.

The debate is closed.
Of that there is no doubt.
That must be spelled out very clearly.
They must be given the choice.

This is also a vital message to Turkey.
That, too, is only right and proper.
It is in our interests to avoid that.
So let us wake up!
My Group abhors that tactic.
What is it that we wish to create?
This cannot be in Europe's interests.
Thank you.
That promise has not been kept.
That is not happening either.
The Brok report is rather like this.
Why enlarge the European Union?
In what direction?
At what risk or with what benefits?
And there is the rub.
Thank you.
I fully agree with this view.
Our citizens feel unprotected.

Can we allow this?
Where are the international rules?
Where is the humanity, I ask myself?
(Applause)
I listened very attentively to them.
We know that.
He also killed a policeman.
This is unacceptable.
This is unacceptable.
He is 34.
This is all totally unacceptable.

(The President cut off the speaker)
I believe we share this understanding.
What legal protection was he granted?
Just a word about Gilad Shalit.
We are going to condemn him utterly.
We are not going to apply sanctions.
No mention of that.
Imagine this Chamber full of children.
That is what we are talking about.
Just to clarify that to start with.
Then Israel will release its prisoners!
The debate is closed.
Situation in Zimbabwe (debate)
First, the conversation with Mr Ping.
What is the problem?
They are not at all alike.
So this is the first point.
They should be ashamed.
What is to be done?
Instead there is continuing violence.
Mugabe yet again is playing for time.
There has to be an additional mediator.
That is an extraordinary admission.
The process needs a kick-start.
The second point regards the mediator.
We must not fail.
I hope it will not happen like that.
South Africa needs to do more.


What is the African Union's problem?

Question Time (Commission)
This is obvious.
A pirate copy has been leaked.

Yes, this is how it really is.
It regards it as necessary.
It is of concern.
I would like to thank the Commissioner.
Perhaps you would respond to that?
That is their only chance now.
Let me give a few examples.
What is your advice on this?
We cannot stand by and fail to act.
I would not like to see that happening.

Space and security (debate)
I will start with reconnaissance.
A word on financing.
The Commission finds that most welcome.
That will happen in September.
We do not have that at present.
That brings me to a second point.
Think and act.
So far so good.
It actually lists military measures.
We reject that.
The report also wants it both ways.
That is inevitable.
The reality is quite simple.
Yet most Americans share that view.
What threat is there?
The debate is closed.
This came as a great surprise to us.
So much for Mauritania.
You told us, 'There is no problem.


I will not elaborate any further.
The debate is closed.
The other subjects were not discussed.

Lastly, the question of the visa fee.
I find that totally inappropriate.
And that is not all!
Mr President, just a quick point.
I think that that is a very good idea.
Those are my thoughts.
Why choose the age of six?
The debate is closed.

How will you monitor that?
Take the United Kingdom, Commissioner.
Is that fair?
That is the first thing.
We should all welcome this.
Is everything sorted out, then?
No, far from it.
We are only just beginning.
We all know this.
So, thank you for the measures.
There is no extra money.
It is only from within the EFF.

So there is additionality as well.

The debate is closed.

The next item is voting time.
Explanations of vote
My own instincts are liberal on this.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
To invite the Dalai Lama - no, against.
Many of us have been confused.
Mr Landsbergis, do not tell untruths.
Please keep to the procedure.
Let us look at actions, not words.
The time for warm words is over.
Why do we need this military dimension?
We clearly do not need it.

Hence our vote against.
This is a disgrace!
What about the socio-economic crisis?
What about the first sale fish price?
I voted in favour of the resolution.
I voted in favour of the resolution.
Hence our vote against.
The report went much too far.
These views are reflected in my vote.
(Applause)
(Applause)
How do we prevent immobility?
That is what is expected of us.
(Applause)
I do not regret that choice.
Therefore, it is perfectly democratic.
There will not be a new treaty.
It is either Lisbon or Nice.
The 2004 enlargement was a success.
I want to be perfectly clear on this.
Of course I do not regret enlargement.
The family must stay together.
(Applause)
It is Lisbon and enlargement.
There are 27 members in this family.
Nobody should be left behind.
(Applause)
What, then, are our priorities?
Protectionism gets us nowhere.
The last generation!
Europe must set an example.
Europe must lead by example.
We have a goal: the 2009 conference.
(Applause)
That is a priority.
(Applause)
23, you say?
OK, 23 then, but that is still not bad.
So what does this mean?
(Applause)
(Applause)
Yes, we have NATO.
I do not think that this is reasonable.
(Applause)
(Applause)
May I make one point.
(Applause)
(Applause)
There is a European cultural exception.
(Applause)
Europe has suffered a great deal.
(Applause)
That is cowardice.
(Applause)
To debate what?
What is the right economic strategy?
What is the right monetary strategy?
We are having a debate.
I know that it is difficult.
(Loud applause)
(Applause)
That is the key.
Now we have achieved this.
(Applause)
Not alone, but together.
Personally, I am confident.
This practice is a disgrace to Europe.
I welcome this.
We can do a great deal together.
We must engage our citizens in Europe.
You have our support, Mr Hortefeux.
Nothing!
(Heckling)
(Applause, heckling)
I believe that is a serious error.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
We need courage, therefore.
I know that you are a courageous man.
(Applause from the left)
France gave us the Rights of Man.
Now France must lead in their defence.
Play a team game.
(Applause)
(Laughter)
(Applause)
This is the problem.
(Applause from the centre and left)
That is the truth.
(Applause from the centre and left)
Let us have a discussion, then.
Let us have one.
This cannot continue.
(Applause from the centre and left)
I hope you enjoy it!
This is what we want to hear.
(Applause from the centre and left)
(Applause from the centre and left)
So far so good.
But what then?
This is where the problem lies.
(Applause from the left)
This is what we do not want.
What is your answer to that?
And I have not mentioned all of them.
(Applause from the left)
As for us, we want decisions.
(Applause from the speaker's group)
From President Uribe, the democrat?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Why just target the German industry?
Any other way of thinking is suicidal.
Allow me to say that I do not think so.
What would social harmonisation mean?
This is the best way to avoid excesses.
Can you see why?
Everyone has to make an effort.
I respect you.
Others have made other choices.
I never have been and I never will be.
Perhaps we can meet halfway.
(Laughter)
No hard feelings.
(Laughter)
I would like to discuss two subjects.
I think that Benin needs its elites.
I want to go there and I want to talk.
We always talk about agreements.
I want to talk about something else.
(Applause)
He is a socialist, I am not.
I would like to say one last thing.
Look at Macao.
I am even going to go further.
(Applause)
No more and no less.
(Loud applause)
That is the true social Europe.
I am thinking about pensions.
That is the first avenue.
(Applause)
None of them wanted to leave Ireland.
They were forced to leave Ireland.
I agree with you.
That is right for France.
It is not an either/or.
Well, the Irish people have spoken.
Will you respect the Irish vote?
I do not think that you get it, do you?
What price democracy, Mr Sarkozy?
You are going to Dublin on 21 July.
Please do not do it.
We would never say that.
I could not agree with you more.
I am talking about transparency.
Imagine what we could do together.
Europe is more than the market economy.
It is about jobs and people.
Let us care about them.
(DE) I agree.
The Irish 'no' must be respected.
This will not be an easy presidency.
(Applause)
Do not let those T-shirts confuse you.
(Applause)
This is a difficult moment for Europe.
We do have experience.
We can go down that same route.
You radiate enthusiasm and pride.
Thank you very much.
This is a crisis of identity.
Be courageous!
(Applause)
We also need a timetable for Macedonia.
Good luck, President Sarkozy.
That was clear from his priorities.
There can be no deadlines.
I think it is a little bit too much.
We have already gone well over time.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
The United Kingdom is a great nation.
How can that be done?
It does not work that way.
If so, I shall give him the floor.

(Applause)
Mrs De Sarnez is quite right.
I share this ambition.
(Applause)
Mrs Sudre, thank you for your support.
This is what I am saying.
This is not a small decision.
I am not na√Øve in saying that.
The worst risk is to take no risks.
Thank you for your support.
For six years we have had growth.
(Loud applause)
Many thanks, President Sarkozy.
We look forward to your next visit.
That concludes this item.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Thank you, Mr President.
Nobody needs a Bosman Mark 2.
Ratifications should not continue.
The social area was totally overlooked.
Why am I placing emphasis on this?
This also has an ethical dimension.
We are merely carrying out a service.
Emissions trading must be improved.
The situation is serious.
I will limit myself to two points:
There are many examples of this.
The Union needs the Lisbon Treaty.
Quorum
I therefore have discretion.
I shall listen closely to your reply.
That is how I understand paragraph 4.
We are all aware of this.
That is one issue.
This has not happened.
Obviously he did not.
We can all see that.
We must not kid ourselves.
The debate can take place.
The quorum issue concerns voting.
We think these urgencies are important.
Paragraph 4 is quite clear.
That is clear.
That is how I read it.
That is what the rule is about.

The debates will therefore begin.
1.
This is a very disturbing thing.
It has been raised over and over again.
It is nothing of the sort.
I think that justifies the urgency.
Only China has benefited from it.
I do not support the resolution.
The debate is closed.
2.
Situation in Bangladesh
So there have been some positive moves.
Bangladesh is not an oil state either.
That is not yet the case.
Mr Matsakis is absolutely right.
The army has appeared in the streets.
We have heard this one before.
It is beset by natural disasters.
I support the resolution.
This must change.
It is not the minority groups.
The debate is closed.
3.
This is a very specific situation.
The true number was undoubtedly higher.
That is not the case.
The debate is closed.
Quorum (continuation)
You are referring to paragraph 5.
I do not see them.
Therefore we will proceed to the vote.

Order of business
Thank you, Mr Swoboda.
That is as I understand it.
Do we agree on that?
It seems we do.
I also want to add my condolences.
Our officials will follow the case.
Thank you.
Many of them were injured.
We condemn all kinds of violence.
We really do need to be alert to that.

Please sort this out.
That concludes the item.
You have also raised some concerns.
We absolutely agree.
One cannot exist without the other.
It cannot be a basic prerequisite.
Actually I am very much for that.
The question is: are they sufficient?
I was glad to hear this and welcome it.
Efforts would then be complete.
This is the aim of the proposed texts.
You also mentioned the Lisbon Treaty.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 142)

Written statements (Rule 142)
This law needs to be revised.
Let me try to explain why.
However, this system is deeply unjust.
This is the first injustice.
What does that involve?
I find that a worrying conclusion.
Situation in Georgia (debate)
Thank you Commissioner.
All this had to be very precise.
The immediate result was the ceasefire!
We are working to this end.
Were they ready prepared or not?
That is what we are expecting.
This has not been discussed.
(Applause)
That is what we have always demanded.
Today has been a very important marker.
Thank you for your attention.
Please stand firm.
Stalin.
Putin.
Give in?'
Russia has made no such attempt.
What has Russia done?
(Applause)
No.
We need to review our energy policy.
Perhaps, I am not sure.
Of course not!
Therefore we should not talk rubbish.
This lesson is also valid for Russia.
(Applause)
Let us restore the European order!
What does 'successfully' mean?
We will do this, or so I hope.
Not by any stretch of the imagination!
I say this without any cynicism.
It was also a Communist country.
This is also true for Georgia.
He was born there.
What is worse than the Balkans?
The Caucasus.
What is worse than the Caucasus?
The Balkans.
Nothing.
Do not forget the initial figures.
I am not sure.
I have not made this up.
I have seen many refugees in my life.
These were scared witless.
This must also be checked.
They are our great neighbour.
It is he who turns the tap, not us.
What has Mr Saakashvili done?
Who do we believe?
I do not know.
We have tried.
I am not going to go into this problem.
Nothing is taken for granted.
That is absolutely clear.
Aggression cannot pay.
What should have been done?
This brings us back to what you said.
Mr Cohn-Bendit, what are we doing now?
It was not at all perfect.
There can be no doubt of this.
That is actually our duty.
We therefore did not have to vote.
I believe that we were right.
I do not understand.
Too much nationalism is war.'
I wanted to correct that.
We must tackle this idea head on.
I absolutely disagree with it.
That is what we are trying to do.
Perhaps he will do so at a later date.
He proposed this on 5 June to you all.
It needs an EU policy.
That is what we have tried to do.
This I can understand.
We were also critical.
I wanted to talk to you about this.
No!
This is totally different.
I am about to finish.
Russia is just one state.
It is not special.
Now we have one war behind us.
No one reacted.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Let us be blunt.
Is Ukraine next, one has to wonder?
(The President cut off the speaker.)
We must have a proper foreign policy.
We will not allow history to falter.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is unacceptable.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We are now reaping the rewards of this!
Congratulations.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
How should Europe respond?
It has become a mantra.
(The President cut off the speaker)
However, this is not enough.
Reconstruction is not enough.
It is not just about money.
We look forward to that.
(Applause)
I agree with absolutely everything.
Let us see how things stand.
The French Minister is quite right.
It does not expect them to stand firm.
If not us, then who?
If not now, then when?
(Applause)
What a tragedy.
(Applause)
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you very much.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(Applause)
We must not waste this opportunity.
Let us be firm and act politically.
We must now await Moscow's reaction.
Kosovo could not be a unique case ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Who was powerful?
It is not a scoop.
These are the questions.
I now come to the European Council.
This is therefore a starting point.
(Applause)
? The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Written statements (Rule 142)

The situation was appalling!
Thank you.
We therefore need this harmonisation.
Others are not.

There is no need to harmonise.
It is an important development.

I have four points to make.
This is in fact a moral imperative.
These are enormous sums of money.
It is scandalous.

National actions are not enough.
Thank you.
2.5% of GDP is at stake.

Why?

We must try to avoid conciliation.
We have no choice.

(Applause)
For our group, it certainly is!
Uncontrolled financial markets.
Hence this new package.
Well, it is not really new.
It is a rehash of earlier proposals.
But it is big.
Allow me to focus on funding.
One size fits all, some say.
The EU is protectionist.
You are afraid of globalisation.
Do not fight it.
Do not combat it.
Join it.
So which statement do you believe?
For that I congratulate them.
I wish my government did the same.
This is all about sustainability.
To this end we need motivating lessons.
I will name two of them in particular.
Will the same be true of the Council?
It is perhaps doubtful, as we know.
Let us take three examples among many.
Second example: works councils.
We have wasted enough time here.
Operatives in this field are confused.
It is irresponsible.
That would be better.

(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
That can happen very quickly.
How can we break the vicious circle?
Indignation is rising among citizens.
Very few.
Obviously it is very slow.

No, Commissioner.
The new rules raise many questions.
It will not work like that.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Europe is a social project today.
Everyone rejects discrimination.
Nevertheless, questions may be asked.
I could give many other examples.
And what do we see today?
No, it is not!
What is this, if not discrimination?
Thank you.
We all know what the problem is there.
Secondly, the Secondment Directive.
Why so little so late?
Why have these things happened?
But why do you pursue such policies?
Are we just writing rhetoric?
In this context, I fear that we are!
You ain't seen nothing yet.'
Does this agenda achieve this?
Regretfully, no.
Where is our solidarity with the poor?
I hope it will be a success.
They are incredibly important.
Of course it would not!
The question has been asked.
I am a firm believer in pragmatism.
And how do you create it?
Everyone knows it in all honesty.
Can we say that?
What is the new legal position?
Should the directive be revised?
We have to be clear about this now.
Are we not well into 2008?
We are, I agree.
Is it too late?
Certainly not!
It is never too late.
Have we the desire to move forward?
Obviously we do.
This is not the case.

Quite the opposite.

This engagement is sorely needed.
We voted in favour of this proposal.
Europe is sorely mistaken.

It should not therefore be harmonised.

There were strong protests.

You mentioned Georgia.
That is true.
Thank you.
The next item is the joint debate on
Thank you, Mr Chatel.
Why?
But I do not kid myself.
We should preserve this.
We must now consider ICT as a resource.
The sector we are debating is worth it.
This is a package.
Those are big political decisions.
We are doing this in two bites.
They are entitled to data security.
This is a very important entitlement.
Does responsibility lie with the EU?
For which aspects is it competent?
Is it about telephone systems?
Surely that is completely out of date!
Or is it about mobile phones?
What is Skype then?
What are telephone payment services?
Are they telecoms too?
What about RFID networks?
It is not clear.
Who is responsible for those data then?
What use is that to a citizen?
Where can I turn to as a citizen?
We cannot contribute to this.
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam President.
I will give you just a few reasons why.
We shall see.
BERT will play a major role.
We do not like that at all.
This is a sisyphean task.
I repeat - at any cost!
This is not done out of helplessness.
Thank you.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
They are the economy's nervous system.
To what end?
You are quite right, Mrs Reding.
That is the question.
We must reconcile these two aspects.

I want to emphasise that point.
It is a really big responsibility.

I recommend this report to the House.

That has to be made clear.
Mr President, I have two points.
The debate is closed.

We must join forces to that end.
Violence against women is unacceptable.

Women only appear in the background.

We need to know more.
So why is this important?

Let me give you an example here, too.
It can also reflect poor creative work.
You never see them in the adverts.
Best practice is a better idea.
That is completely beside the point.
You have my sincere thanks.
Advertising affects us subconsciously.

I do not believe so.

Not through measures at EU level.

In all events, we need to be vigilant.

What effects would that have on humans?
Frankenstein is lurking at the door!
That is why I am voting 'no' this time.
These aspects are clearly interrelated.

Effective in relation to what?
That is the key point.

Make no mistake.
However, that is not all.
Sanctions are an instrument.

They could also be counter-productive.
Perhaps we should sanction ourselves!
I also welcome its many conclusions.
That has its consequences.
Unified action is just as crucial.
Thank you for your attention.
Where is the sense in that?
Some people have mentioned Cuba.
It is incredibly hypocritical.
We should not agree to that, of course.
Take Andijan as an example.
It is difficult to quantify.
Europe needs more unity.

We know how these issues can be solved.
That is absolute nonsense.
We have to change things.
Will it deliver on that promise?
We know how much it costs.
This much is clear.
These are the hard facts.
It beggars belief.
This is a woman's right.

There should be no discrimination.
It was a relative success.
Services are people doing activities.
What are those services?
We cannot say.
That is the bottom line.
Who can assure us of this?
Because it could happen.
Congratulations!
No!
This inspires hope.

Written statements (Rule 142)
Two main safeguards are built in.
One concerns audit provisions.
Surely not.
That remains the priority.
Quite the opposite.
We must be clear about this.
I consider this to be a major issue.
Is this not hypocrisy?
Not one!
The rapporteur is right.

This is unacceptable.
I agree with that completely.

There is another reality, however.
Others question its flexibility.
I do not think so.
I think the Council got it right.
Soil is a local, a localised medium.
That would be absurd.
It has to be stopped.
Thank you for your attention.
I believe the opposite is the case.
The soil is an asset common to us all.
She knows what she is talking about.
Let us leave this to the Member States.
This is a sensitive issue.
This is a Member State issue.
It is ludicrous.

Thank you for your attention.
Thank you.
Every human being has equal dignity.
This has come about because of drought.
I too favour transparency in funding.
There is no debate.

These figures should worry us.
A new assessment should follow.

Now is the time to act.
Be bold, and we will support you.'
It is really sad.
We hope it will do so soon.
But no one is out of the woods yet.
This is now being implemented.
I commend Members for these reports.
There are two sides to everything.
The legislative period is not yet over.
This we can say with hindsight.
It is ridiculous.
What lesson can we draw from this?

I believe this is essential.
I for one do not think so.
You put forward this proposal .
How can this happen in a single day?
A short time ago I was in China.
Well, fair enough!
That is the reality.
That is the reality!
But transparency is what we need.
We have an enduring financial crisis.
We therefore need action.
We cannot ignore the agenda.
It is time for action!
This is what is on the agenda.
This is not an easy debate.
Nothing could be more wrong!
What is the perspective of the left?
Prevention is better than cure.
Beware Sarbanes-Oxley!
And I am prepared to do that.
What are we talking about here?

That is how transparent things are!
The situation demands action.
I entirely agree with you.

We must keep a watchful eye on this.

Open Parliament means open standards.

We are not aiming for more petitions.

I am going to try to respond briefly.
We do need this new tool.
That is my wish.
Terrorism is the scourge of our age.
(Applause)
How come we assess things differently?
Trust is hard to gain but easy to lose.
People's sex lives?
What constitutes 'provocation'?
Am I myself being provocative now?
Unclear legislation is bad legislation.
We have to consider this.
Finally, I have two specific questions.
What can we do?
What has happened?
Many thanks.
Excellent.
When can it be considered public?
Terrorism is provoked.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We are not fighting terrorism.
Europe can lead by example here.
This must be avoided.
This is why we must arm ourselves.
This is our imperative duty.
Action needs to be taken here.
The EU often has not helped.
Let us do both with utmost care.
Congratulations on both reports.
The consequences were horrific.
Mr President, I welcome this report.
Drastic measures are called for.
Mrs Ludford also shares this concern.
It is worth pointing this out.
The Council must be true to its word.

Explanations of vote
Oral explanations of vote
I think not.
Thank you.
This is important.
We should not rush to judgement here.
People accepted it.
I want to explain why I did so.
Written explanations of vote
There can be no harm in this.
It is often a question of priorities.
Half of humanity is counting on it...
Words that speak for themselves ...
I voted in favour of the report.
The profession has to be fulfilling.
It has to be seen as a good career.
An added concern is violence in school.
This is a good, business-like report.
This is a worldwide trend.
Hence the importance of this report.
The report therefore has my backing.
I therefore voted in favour of it.
We therefore voted against the report.
An honest admission!
Even the rapporteur admits this.
It is too ridiculous for words.
That is why we abstained.
This report deserved an abstention.
Last year this amounted to 42%.
I voted in favour of the report.
The next item is the joint debate on
This is the real question before us.
Is everything in order?
Can they work quickly enough?
Is compensation paid out?
What remains to be resolved?
I do not see Mr Kohl√≠ƒçek in his seat.
The Council wants more.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Finally I will move on to my report.
Nevertheless, here we are.
How can we do this?
I back these amendments.

These are not unimportant dossiers.
This is unacceptable.
It is bizarre.
This is unacceptable.
I appeal to you to carry on.
Let us all fight together on this!
Welcome
(Applause)
What does that mean?
That is the first thing.
We need to have confidence in Europe.
I am counting on you.
This is wholly undesirable.
Firstly, there is no need.
What price political correctness then?
Safety is of crucial importance.
How can it be solved?
We cannot afford to fail.

I think this is very important.
(EL) The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
It is also one of the cheapest.
Sea piracy (debate)
This was not an isolated incident.
The circumstances demand it.
What can we do about the pirates?
I think that is quite a quick response.
I should like to explain why.
What kind of game is this?
It is not the business at all!
What do we want?
Gunboat policy?
Do we want a shot across the bows?
Do we want to sink ships?
I say this only as a warning.
Now we seem helpless.
Why is the EU getting involved?
This is unacceptable.
We ought to be informed directly.
One of them concerns the legal aspect.
It does have a mandate for terrorism.

The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)

That is what I wanted to say.
Mr Ryan is right.
However, this is not enough.
This is an extremely serious issue.
You cannot go back to the text.
There are numerous causes.
Where exactly are we with this?
I thank the Minister for his reply.
Sanctions, to date, have not worked.
Are there alternative sanctions?
Mr President, it is a pleasure.
This is what I thought you would say.
This much I do know.
This is a fact and is not disputed.
The next item is the joint debate on:
We raised four concerns.
We will now hear from the Council.
I would like to emphasise this point.
The technical experts realise this.
the setting of compulsory milestones.
It is also absolutely essential.
SIS II will operate under two pillars.
I do not wish to contribute to that.
No true Europhile should accept that.
We need to be very careful.
It is not a question of that.
That is all, Mr President.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
The next item is the joint debate on:
We badly need to introduce efficiency.
Anything else would be inconceivable.
Please give us an explanation.
Why?
Quite right, a very good proposal.
He is quite right in doing so.
There are two reasons for this.
Seeds are usually non-dormant.

How do we tackle this problem?
Where do we start?
You were right to underline this.
I announced a text for October.
Is it the interpretation?
Was I not clear enough?
I would like to clarify this.
I am used to listening to Parliament.
Right.
Thank you.

Statement by the President
Thus the Treaty of Lisbon is vital.
That needs to be decided.
That is the major problem.
What will that future bring?
That is completely unacceptable.
That is the first pillar.
The second issue is climate change.
Finally, my third point concerns SMEs.
SMEs are the key to European growth.
These results are a call to order.
Otherwise, it is a pointless exercise.
Europe cannot do this alone.
It should not shoot itself in the foot.
At last!
So far so good.
On this point, then, no-one disagrees.
I have five points to make.
The third point is simplification.
We reiterate this year after year.
This is a good point.
Thank you very much.
The third thing is mobility of workers.
This reminds me of firefighting.
So we have to deal with that as well.
We have to be able to respond.
We will also continue to deliver.
We will not be a caretaker Commission.
I think that this is part of it.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Written statements (Rule 142)
This approach has to be a two-way road.

It is a critical time for the summit.
This is a very serious sign.
Nuclear disarmament?
No chance!
Strengthening the NPT regime?
No chance!
Credibility in negotiations with Iran?
No chance!
The repression is still going on.
India is a new donor.
There is no easy solution to that.
It is now time that we have delivery.
There was a question on civil aviation.

Finally, one thing about the ECB.
I think we need to thank the ECB.
The ECB did a very good job.
However, what is he going to discuss?
(The President cut off the speaker)
I am generally fair, Mr Purvis.
What about conflicts of interest?
Not all financial innovation is sound.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
This something involves various things.
Warnings were given some time ago.
Maybe they are state-owned banks.
Let us see how we can set about it.
Money does not grow on trees.
Self-regulation is not enough.
Today, however, the crisis is global.
Why do I say that?
Let me give you an example.
I do not think so.
That must not happen in this House.
There is no alternative.
We can begin as of now.
I am not the first to say so.
Let us talk about specific progress.

But still we can do quite a lot.
On the structural reforms.
Let me just make two final remarks.
We are not going to step on your toes.
This is without doubt essential.
It is the question of excise duty.
Why not consider this idea?
That is our basic view.
Big in itself, but a lot less than 52%.
What about this 80%?
Look at Nord Stream.

Question Time (Commission)
Part one
Subject: Eurozone budget deficit limits
You mentioned in particular the UK.
Will you support it?
There are two options here.


Are you in the 40-45% or 35% camp?
So I will stay with 35%.
So 35% was actually the compromise.
Could the Commissioner comment on that?
Why is it not being used now?
No, we do not fix prices.
So, flexibility is given.
So what happened?
That is the American way of doing it.
Is a new institution required here?
I am very sorry.
So it is a purely technical question.
We are not yet there.
I favour this.
We need to face this problem together.
Or indeed within the EU?
There are at least two reasons.
We all have to pay for it.
I think this is crucial.
Often these things are hidden in foods.
The website has already been improved.
I just want to say a final word on VAT.
Quite simply, they have a poorer diet.
We know that trans-fats are bad for us.
When shall we get a ban on trans-fats?
That is where we should be investing.
We must act, and we must act quickly.
Everyone has a responsibility.
That should be our approach.
I cannot understand why.
We need freedom, not nannying.
Freedom also implies responsibility.
What are we eating?
Where are we seeing these products?
How do we get to know about them?

I am sorry, I am so embarrassed.
(Applause)
(Applause)
I am sorry, I cannot do this.
I am really sorry.

(Applause)
Thank you.

Merci, Ingrid Betancourt!

It is now a European crisis.
It is now an international crisis.
It is time for action.
We must continue to act without delay.
This is how we will restore confidence.
They need to be quick and daring.
Welcome
(Applause)
Fire-fighting is not enough.
It is the right way forward.
This is completely understandable.
Finally, the Lisbon Treaty.
These are not ordinary times.
We owe it to our citizens.
(Applause)
There are many reasons for this crisis.
We must ask them for an explanation.
The Commission is right.
We need a support plan for SMEs.
The Treaty of Nice currently applies.
That is also the reality.
(Heckling)
(Applause)
It simply will not work.
The new house must be different.
Yes, he knows what he is talking about.
(Applause)
It will take a long time.
That is a perverse system.
Our citizens are worried.
We need a collective response.
Europe was slow to heed such worries.
Parliament is in fact divided, in part.
I think this is essential.
I have two further points.
The banks have got a bail-out.
The banks have got a guarantee.
Later may be too late.
So what?
The markets are saying it already.
But it must be one thing or the other.
By doing so they create a moral hazard.
This will not prevent the crisis.
This will merely postpone it.
There are three types of priority.
I agree with what Mr Schulz said.
We need much more coordination.
We need an action plan.
He knows we will support him on this.
That is what is important.
It is all our interests.
I think that timing was unfortunate.
Your services were told.
Where was your Commissioner then?
Up to now, I have seen no such thing.
Nothing has been done for far too long!
Perhaps that is no bad thing.
Well, it is true!
No!
No!
No!
I believe that this has to change.
Elections were not democratic.
This was unavoidable.
I for one would not.
How do we deal with this kind of case?
In that, he is truly right.
We must act quickly.
Where is Mrs Kroes?
Who has said even one word about that?
Could I just make one final point?
It is not possible, surely.
What does this mean?
We have taken note of them.

We are now at the end of that.
Responsibilities need to be kept clear.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
For up to six months, or a year.
Thank you.
This is not justice.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Unfortunately, nothing happened.
We need to be logical about this.
This is more important than ever.
One crisis should not mask another.
This still exists.
That is still the case.
These crises are interlinked.
This is essential.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Now, what is going to happen next?
They do not abolish tax havens.
Thank you very much.
Not all financial innovation is benign.
Do moral values matter?
Yes, I believe they do matter.
There is no silver bullet here.
Strong, fast responses are essential.
Colleges of supervisors are essential.
The time ahead will be fraught.
The ECB should get more information.
It is very important for the future...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
I raise two particular points.
We should have clear, simple rules.
We are witnessing this now.
We have left them on their own.
That is a good thing in politicians!
So a European solution was there.
It is a bit similar here.
I think they should do it much earlier.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
Welcome
(Applause)
Situation in Belarus (debate)
The results are not encouraging.
We will review the situation with him.
We have done this on trust.
I support this desire wholeheartedly.
Our declaration is a very balanced one.
A reward for what, however?
(HU) Thank you, Madam President.
It's up to us to decide ...
Politics is not a concert.
What about us?
What do we have to do?
We must act as Europe.
What does this mean for us?
We should give this some thought.

The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 142)
People should not be punished.
It is high time to change.
The people of Belarus deserve as much.
Composition of Parliament : see Minutes
Corrigenda (Rule 204a): see Minutes
The next item is the debate on:
(Applause)
Transparency is absolutely key.
That is your voice in Europe.
But one thing is clear.
This is ongoing work.
The cultures are too diverse.
This is unacceptable.
Why?
We need to do more than just explain.
It is not imprecise at all.
It is in fact well defined.
Time is running out.
Act now.
It is not impossible.
I know only too well, as I am a lawyer.
He has some cheek!
It is a clear argument.
What has been done?
It just would not happen.
It is this that is missing today.
This also exists at European level.
What does this mean?

I did not ask for more time.
We already have a register.
This is a very wide definition.
So we do not share that view.
The debate is closed.
I do not have time to go into details.

Catholic churches are being destroyed.
Do they apply it to all people?
Europe, wake up!
But there is hope.
Well then, here is a surprise.
Thank you Le Monde, thank you Plantu.
Plantu for President!
(The President cut off the speaker)
This has now happened.
Dr Toben is a Holocaust denier.
But this is not the point.
(HU) Thank you, Madam President.
This is a procedural matter.
Thank you.
That concludes the item.
There has been a reform of the CAP.

So this is actually an opportunity.
This is not the answer.
The WTO tries to have globalised rules.
In this case, it did not.
Is the WTO simply boring the world now?
Certainly not!
He was a good negotiator.
All the best!
We are now talking about trade policy.
Let us take that responsibility!
We are in a serious position.
I think you are kidding.
Do we have a circus?
Do we have a restaurant?
Do we have a club?
You have to fight your way through.
Your comments are noted, Mr Sturdy.
This is a flawed framework.
This is absolutely fundamental.
It was not an agreement at any cost.
I will reply briefly to Mrs McGuinness.
Please keep this in mind.
It is very important.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 142)
We should remember this.
Why should we do that?
The answer is simple.
I will now speak in Polish.
That is obvious.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
Thank you.
Well, what about water?
This is even more precious.
Well, what about in Europe?
Water scarcity exists even in Europe.
That is a disgrace.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
I would like to thank the rapporteur.
(SK) Water is life.
This is a pan-European problem.
Thank you for your attention.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written declarations (Rule 142)

It is a special place for many people.
The Arctic is different.
There is much more that I could say.
There are several reasons to do it.
That has never happened before.
What was this supposed to mean?
This has never been mentioned before.
We have close ties with Iceland.
There is no time for delay.
This is a serious contradiction.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
That concludes the debate.

I would like to remind Members of that.
Where would we be without the euro?
These symbols unite, not divide, us.
The same applies to symbols.
Thank you for your attention.
I believe that there are two reasons.
Why?
That is our motto.
No politics without symbols!
The move should therefore be opposed.
'Will be purged of'!
The answer is 'none'.
I personally do not.
What are we going to do now?
Well done, ladies and gentlemen!
What is their current status?
There is, however, an anomaly.
There is another question.
This is a contradiction.
The EU flag in Cyprus symbolises unity.
The Turkish flag symbolises division.
Is it because they are states?
Symbols do not represent only states.
The debate is closed.

This is sad.
Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est!
Here is yet another example.
This is exactly what has been done.
Why?
We want to shape the future!
Written explanations of vote
Another 'typical' report ...
This may only apply until 2019.
I cannot agree to that.
More words for what purpose...
That includes Belarus.
It is just pure cynicism.
So near, yet so far.
There is no European super-state!
What hypocrisy...
What cynicism...
They are there in any case.
They also have a duty to remember.
That is all too evident today.
Surely this is unacceptable.
This is simply not true.
Water is a finite resource.
I therefore abstained in the vote.
Their actions were a disgrace.
The current divide is based on health.
That is why I abstained in the vote.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
They represent barely 3% of resources.

I find this very disconcerting.
Many thanks, Mr Bradbourn.
This is also in the national interest.
And the same goes for NATO too.
We must therefore react.
Untrammelled freedom turns against us.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you.
All this comes at a price.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
That concludes this item.
Temporary workers (debate)
Their training is often less extensive.
This was an important element.
That was the case with this directive.
(Applause)
Wrong!
It is a bad move.
Reject it.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
Those abuses will end.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
The next item is the joint debate on:
We cannot accept 'forum shopping'.
That is unacceptable.
We cannot accept this.
The Minister has just left.
20% - that is a significant figure!
It is true that there is a limit.
All credit to her.
This fills me with great pleasure.
His reply was 'don't'.
The answer is obviously 'don't'.
Look, there is a paradox here.
That is where the problem lies!
That much is clear.
My thanks to Parliament.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
Written statements (Rule 142)
The next item is the joint debate on:
I shall describe this to you.
It is blatant nonsense.
This is not possible with PNR data.
That has not been demonstrated.
Where does immigration come in?
It has nothing to do with it.
Thank you very much.
Could you respond to this?
This is my plea.
This is not a theoretical question.
Is that proportionate?
Therefore, we must say 'no'.
These are crucial issues.
We know how important that country is.
We must not forget that.
Thank you.
I undertake to do so.
I did not make this up.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
The budget is EUR 950 million.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
There has been progress on this, too.
That gives us an idea of its size.
It is a win-win situation.
I was not able to get a French visa.
Thank you.
That is the point of our cooperation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday.
Written statements (Rule 142)
I am sure it is worth achieving this.
I do not think we should be negative.
There are problems, though.
Thank you very much.
Individual efforts are doomed.
The same is true of mobile telephony.
Girls are contacted for sex contacts.
The report before us is excellent.
- (SK) I congratulate the rapporteur.
The same thing applies to the Internet.
It is very effective.
Thank you.
For me there are three key issues.
That concerns very young children.
The debate is closed.

Written statements (Rule 142)

Recovery of cod stocks (debate)

They have not arrived yet.
Therefore, we must be clear.
(Applause)
I disagree entirely with that view.
I wish to highlight that fact.
I agree with that.
We do have our ears to the ground.
That is where we have to react.
We need to act.
I would like to thank the rapporteur.
This is what we are talking about now.
This is what it is all about.
(HU) Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you, Madam President.
It is precisely the reverse.
This will not effect change.
We must not change the directive.
I cannot support this.
Let us be realistic.
Thank you.
The view of Parliament is quite clear.
That is an issue we have to tackle.
This is not what we want.
However, this is not enough.
There is simply no truth in this.
The Court has had its say.
Quite the contrary.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
Such movement must not be stopped.
European action has been joint action.
What have we tried to achieve?
(Applause)
Words have meaning.
(Applause)
On 8 August, the crisis began.
There were many views on the matter.
What madness.
(Applause)
Their position differed from ours.
That would be irresponsible.
Europe has brought about peace.
That was the way things stood.
What attempts were made at that time?
How could all this have been possible?
This idea is making headway.
Europe must and will propose ideas.
(Applause)
We have tried everything in the world.
The answer is clearly 'no'.
(Applause)
Who will take part in this summit?
There are many schools.
That is the long and short of it.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Why would it be irresponsible?
(Applause)
What is meant by 'missing our date'?
It was not easy.
Two points remain before I conclude.
This economic crisis is here.
There are several initiatives.
The institutions are an issue, however.
Very serious.
We can no longer continue like this.
That was the spirit of the treaty.
(Applause)
(Whispering)
All this is along the right lines.
(Applause)
That must not happen again.
We do not have much time.
(Applause)
(General hilarity)
(Cry of 'ladies')
(Applause)
(Cry of 'Mr P√∂ttering too')
We need more purchasing power.
(Applause)
You are on the right track.
(Applause)
You draw attention to our successes.
(Applause)
(Applause)
It is like being in a dream!
I do not agree with this.
(Applause)

(Applause)
Be quiet, I am the one speaking.
How and why are we going to invest?
It is a content debate.
(Applause)
We have failed banks and failing banks.
This is another issue, you may say.
(Applause)
You did it off your own bat.
Mr Daul, thank you for your support.
There were a number of strategies.
(Applause)
I would go even further.
You are absolutely right.
What, then, was I trying to do?
Maybe it was a mistake.
(Laughter and applause)
Why?
(Applause)
(Applause)
I prefer action.
What happened?
(Applause)
(Loud applause)
That is the truth of the matter.
That is how it should be.
We need to remind ourselves of this.
It seems doubtful.
Clearly, we now need to go further.
Congratulations on that achievement.
I have a final quotation.
Let us keep momentum.
That is the first commitment.
This is simply not true.
It is now or never.
That must not take place.
(Applause)
We must be aware of this risk.
That is all.
Why can we not manage it straight away?
I am not blaming anybody.
Emphatically, enough is enough.
We have the right to speak freely.
What happened?
It is a risk.
No one.
What is the difference?
What sort of Europe would that be?
(Applause)
This is why.
We will look at all these options.
Let us be very open about this.
The response was a definite 'no'.
This is true.
I say this very frankly.
So let us try to act collectively.
(Applause)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Madam President, on a point of order.
(Applause)
Do not be surprised if I cut you off.
(Applause)
We want agreement by Christmas.
(Applause)
No one is interested in us.

Your words are fundamental and right.
Mr Schulz responded to him.
(Applause)
The first one is the financial crisis.
(Applause)
(The President cut off the speaker)
It is now more important than ever.
I should like to raise two of them.

(The President cut off the speaker.)
We really need institutional solutions.

What do we mean by a new deal?
We must have a sense of responsibility.
That, I think, is what I can tell you.
Finally, the budget.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.

In fact, this is not really a surprise.

For this reason, we shall abstain.
We are sceptical about these proposals.
They are fully compliant with the law.
This includes family law.
EU-Russia relations (debate)
So please accept my apologies.
Of course not.
It has to take place.
I fully support dialogue with Russia.
Clearly, it is a great country.
That is true.
That is the wrong image.
He should not be rewarded for that.
Unfortunately he stood alone.
In this case we must lead the way.
This is also happening on other levels.
We must be open to discussions.
(Applause)
I have one final observation to make.
I am left with three questions.
This is a historical fact.
Thank you for your attention.
Ethnic cleansing is still going on.
Are there grounds for trusting Russia?
Thank you.
I hope that we can both live with that.
This is where its interests lie.
None of this is good.
This is a challenge for us.
However, this is also largely up to us.
Thank you.
There are no two ways about it.
It cannot be on their terms.
No double measures.
That is our duty.
We will never know.
That is the way forward.
Let us have a breakfast company.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We want to cooperate with Russia.
They suffered in the past.
So we cannot keep on looking back.
One must get out of this ambiguity.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is a new Yalta.....
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
I agree.
But what was to be expected?

Georgia is part of Europe.
How should we do that?
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)

What are our interests?
That is also clear.
That is my first point.
Let me now say a word on human rights.
The debate is closed.

Isolating Russia will not help.

That is the very least they could do.
It is a sensitive issue.
Please continue.
Otherwise, it should not be signed.
The debate is closed.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
Question Time (Council)
Subject: Progress on the 'Blue Card'
This challenge is an important one.
Are we simply to say 'Too bad'?
How do you think this ought be done?
Is that fair?
That is what we are hoping for.
Could the presidency please comment?
There has been no pressure there.
It is not easy.
Subject: Air safety
This list is regularly updated.
It was very comprehensive.
Thank you, even if I am interrupting.
We clearly need to do more.
We shall try and continue.
Subject: Electronic passports
That seems quite clear to me.
We cannot have passport swaps.
That must be done.
Subject: Volunteering
Subject: EU policy on GM products
This is what I wanted to point out.
Subject: Situation in Zimbabwe

I realise your problem, Mr Mitchell.
I am keeping to the time.
That concludes Question Time.
They are going to listen to our debate.
That is not an acceptable outcome.

My second point is this.
Why did this happen?
Above all, there will be job cuts.
(Applause)
(Applause)
That is my question, Commissioner.
(Applause)
I am sure this time will not be wasted.
(Applause)
Is that what we want?
(Applause)
So where do things stand now?
(Applause)
I appeal to you for more time.
(Applause)
But the Aker Group has long since gone.
It has become STX of Korea.
Something did not quite work out there.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Perhaps this is that opportunity.
Was this the case, Commissioner?
Why multiply poverty?
But not in Poland.
At least, not so far.
Thank you very much.
It has taken too much time.
So there is a basis for comparison.
Yes, we did.
Please, please, please.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)

The de minimis threshold values apply.
This makes total sense.
It is no more than a drop in the ocean.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you very much.
Parliament is ultimately excluded.
And they are doing so.
Just leave it to the regions.
Nobody has spoken the truth here.
I simply cannot agree to this.
Of course it will have some influence.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
This is perfectly possible.
That is the question.
We do not live in a perfect world.
This is not right.
It was not thought to be necessary.
That is entirely obvious.
Let there be no doubt about this.
This was made law in the case of Spain.
It is clearly not the same thing.
It is a question of balance.
Mr President, let me put this straight.
Perhaps we should forbid them.
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
It also increases security.
I ask that that be looked at.
Otherwise we will not do anything.
The debate is closed.

Why?
In addition, there is a pilot project.
You were hiding somewhere else.
Therefore, we have an opportunity now.
But I fail to see why there is a delay.
Let us not be na√Øve.
I support this report.

Congratulations, Mrs Grosset√™te.
I have one final question.
This must be our starting point.
This is absolutely clear.
That is what we can do.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt is absolutely right.
I could not care less about that.
I do not understand this.

I find this difficult to understand.
Yes, this is essential.
The debate is closed.

Oral explanations of vote
There is no doubt about that.
The question is how to do it.
There are three factors here.
(BG) Thank you, Mr President.
I supported it in the vote.
Such activities are criminal.
That is not the way to do business.
Written explanations of vote
It needs to be urgently addressed.
This is why we will be abstaining.
This is why we cannot vote in favour.
The next item is the joint debate on:
(Applause)
What, then, are our requests?
First of all, there are the payments.
(Applause)
This is what I wished to tell you.
We also support the asterisk amendment.
We have great ambitions.
Rightly so.
It has become a reality.
Thank you very much.
Most of our proposals were accepted.
Next time perhaps.
So what do we see this year?
Fine.
This is the beginning of budget fraud!
After all, those are Europe's assets.
I now come to the political result.
We may succeed.
That is now a job for the Council.
The whole thing makes no sense.
Why is this being done?
We thought it could not get any lower.
We were wrong.
This is regrettable to my mind.
That is extremely important.
We have a lot of work to do.
We had spoken about this with Mr B√∂ge.
The debate is closed.

Much remains to be done.
I agree.
I hope our messages will now be heard.

This is not how it works, though.
Caution is therefore called for.
However, there is a long way to go.
I agree entirely with Mr Maaten.
We need to bear that in mind.

Question Time (Commission)
Findings include the following:
(PT) Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you very much.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
This is always a dilemma.
Part II
You can act on your own initiative.
So this work is on-going.
I would strongly ask you to do that.
I want to echo Mr Ryan's comments.
And that question was not answered.
At present, we have 27 tax bases.
With CCCTB, we would end up with 28.
Then you will understand our position.
Commissioner...
Thank you all the same for the gesture.
Funding is a problem.
This is important.
That concludes Question Time.
(Applause)
Today, Ukraine has also changed.
That does not happen very often.
Sometimes they do, but not always.
We can but try.
This is the demand that must be met.
This horrifying list is almost endless.
I welcome today's debate.
That is the honest truth.
That was how it was in eastern Ukraine.
The men were at the front then.
We must not forget!
Thank you for the floor.
This crime was completely cynical.
Thank you.
(Applause)
All must be named and condemned.
It was genocide.
Communism is a crime against humanity.
Ukraine still bears heavy scars.

This is a fundamental difference.
Both phenomena are to be condemned.
Thank you.
Welcome
(Applause)
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you for your attention.
That concludes this item.
(Applause)
But that is all!
Need I point this out?
I put the question to you.
They are greater than we first thought.
The euro protected us.
Which is the right path to take?
Many thanks to all those responsible.
Budgetary policies must be coordinated.
This is also an issue of governance.
(Applause)
The rest is of trifling importance.
(Applause)
(Applause)
However, Europe is more than that.
More needs to be done.
Crises generate opportunities.
We would be outside.
As everyone knows, this is a myth.
The Euro Zone followed on afterwards.
But this has not happened.
It is doing huge damage to them.
This is not sustainable.
Investors lack confidence in the euro.
The question is, why?
(SV) This report praises the EMU.
Must Sweden join the EMU?
The EMU requires a fundamental reform.
It is a very strong magnet for capital.
Thank you for your attention.
There is no other way.
So much for the past.

This is an absolutely absurd idea.


How much they got that wrong!
(Applause)
Firstly, the euro has passed the test.
That is not real coordination.
The situation has improved since then.
We want to work with you.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
The reasons for the pay gap are varied.
What, then, are we asking for?
Little has changed in fifty years.
Evidently there is no other option.
That is what it is about.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I congratulate Mrs Bauer on her report.
What should we do?
It has not been done.
It is no such thing.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
Let us not have any illusions however.

(The President cut off the speaker)
Action is therefore called for.
We need to take a broader perspective.
This is why we have to do so from here.
Why is this?
What can we do in this situation?
Thank you for your attention.
Families should not be a handicap.
Allow me to make a few remarks.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Article 142)
The problem lies with enforcement.
The political debate lies elsewhere.
It is only fair that we do so.
There is worse to come, however.
Why did it not include it?
I would like to make two remarks.
The big question is why?

The debate is closed.
I am ending.
However, this fund has its limitations.
We are counting on your determination.
We need it.
How does it work?
This is the big issue.
They need actions, not just words.

Thank you for your attention.
They are not the only problems.
We need this Fund.

In principle I agree with this.
(Applause)
(Applause)
So we have to move forward.
We do need to free up the market.
Your position on decoupling is right.
The sheep sector is in decline.
This is a good thing.
Do we want to liberalise the markets?
This is unfair.
Your work with us has been invaluable.
Consumer prices could rise.
How intelligent is that!
Let me move on to milk.
This is not compulsory.
Let the farmers decide.
We must remember that.
We need market support measures.
I wish you luck in your deliberations.
I think this is both unfair and unjust.
Why do I think this?
You speak of a soft landing.
There is also an airport in Guantanamo.
Back to the main topic, though.
Can we please marry these two concepts?
I am not in favour of a 2% increase.
(PL) This is a good report.
I hope that their demands will be met.

Clean water is now a scarce commodity.
This is a misunderstanding.
It is a proposal that I warmly welcome.
Thus, prevention is cheaper than cure.
I do not agree with this.
That is utterly unsustainable.
It is good news all round.
It is not always easy to keep to this.
What a wonderful idea, Commissioner!
I congratulate Mr Busk on this.
Thank you for your attention.
This proposal ticks so many boxes.
This is downright protectionism.

I think it is a disgrace.
So this fruit scheme is welcome.
Written explanations of vote
This is an outrage.
This is particularly severe in Malta.
We need a multifaceted approach.
(Applause)
I shall come back to that.
The Commission made proposals.
That is my feeling.
I personally emphasised this point.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Europe must not deviate from this path.
That is too late.
It is only a very small package.
We want to discuss short selling now.
That must be our goal.
I will give you a brief example.
You are usually such a sensible person.
(Applause)
We must secure jobs.
Thank you, Mr President.
Be ready before the spring meeting.
(Applause)
But they were!
One of them was about sustainability.
That is the way forward.
It does all come around.
It has seldom seemed more appropriate.
I will quote in English:
Is that what this sentence means?
Are wages viewed solely as costs?
This applies even in times of crisis.
(Applause)
Another priority is a people's Europe.
It is a question of credibility.
That is not the way I look at things.
Europe also carries great expectations.
(Applause)
We will support you.
It is a strategic aim.
I totally agree.
(Applause)
My second point is this.
(Applause)
This is not the way, Mr Barroso.
Do you know?
Then prove it!
What are the consequences?
Correct, but then act with courage.
I do not see this as a credit crunch.
I will end with a warning.
We have seen a succession of summits.
No to globalisation!
Now it is time for the hangover.
They were found to be dodgy projects.
Now, what something can we do?
I know it is not easy.
It is a simple exercise.
(Applause)
Let us be realistic and ambitious.
We need to make progress.
We are lacking a clear legal framework.
These issues belong together.
I totally disagree with this view.
In fact we must do the opposite.
Allow me to give two examples.
That is the first issue.
That is where your priorities lie.
All the alarm bells are ringing.
It is about jobs, as ever.
We need at long last to move forward.
It is of crucial importance.
We must open our barriers.
Where is the reduction?
We have not yet seen it.
We have proper laws.
Of course not.
This will only clog up credit creation.
That is only one example.
That is the issue.
How do you intend to resolve it?
(The President cut off the speaker)
So that is absolutely clear.
I think that helps us to deliver.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
At last we can now humanise capitalism!

Question Time (Council)
That was my question.
Thank you for the very good reply.
I hope he did not take it personally.
He is quite correct.
It also has an intercultural vision.
Subject: Opening of dialogue in Cuba
That is the Council's position.
What is the Council's view?
We have seen this.
This is taxpayers' money, of course.
How would you fund that?
How would you refund it?
I alluded to Iceland too.
It is like that sometimes.
It is really considerable.
That is what I can tell you.
That is what I can tell you today.
Transparency must be absolutely vital.
You are quite right, Mrs McGuinness.
I am sorry, but that is it.
(Interjection from the floor)
Thirdly, I agree with Mr R√ºbig.
Mr R√ºbig is correct.
That is a real issue.
That concludes Question Time.
It is the same for the Commission.
We have to live with this.
This is, then, a clear signal.
Some advocate the Internet exclusively.
These traditions have to be respected.
Reducing costs?
Yes, but at what price?
That is my political comment.
I have no problem doing that.
I have no difficulty with it.
So, c'est la vie!
We cannot allow Council to play us.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
European statistics (debate)
This is approximately EUR 230 million.

The crisis has now arisen.
To this I say, let us create it.
Thank you for the floor, Mr President.
Thank you for the floor.
The balance of payments problem?
Why on earth should we do this?
Is this what we are doing today?
Wisely so, in my opinion.
The answer is, of course, no.
What happens then?
Nothing else happens at all.
What is the problem then?
Put an end to it.
Then the problem disappears.
Hungary is just a typical example.
The Bank granted a loan to Hungary.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.

We all wish the best for the EU.

But what can MONUC do?
That is the war.
I think that is the first major point.
So what can we do?
There is also the SADC and Obasanjo.
So what are we really doing?
What is MONUC doing?
It appears to be absolutely right.
What can and what must be done?
That cannot be allowed to happen.
What can the European Union do?
Never again!
Thank you for that!
That was in 1994.
We cannot allow it.
I consider it to be our duty.
Let us address this problem.
I think that he is absolutely right.
The EU must swing into action.

The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Crises in the car industry (debate)
We shall see this in the next few days.
The situation is clear.
I will give you another figure.
It is just that no one can afford them.
The effect is the same.
This can take place in various ways.
The same applies to public procurement.

The outcome is not convincing.
This would be very welcome.

That represents 10% of European GDP.
Manufacturers' results are falling.
Of course, I endorse your proposals.



Sales last month were down 23%.
This is enormous.
Why should this not be possible?
Crises invariably create opportunities.
There is something else we should do.
That makes no sense.
However, we need more, and urgently.
They should never be forgotten.
I will now do so in writing.

Thank you for your attention.
I will now start.
This is a global proposal.

You are depriving them of both.
Giusto, you made a silly mistake.

Why?
We would like to avoid that.
Immigration ought to be inclusion.
This is said to be a bad thing.
Sweden, for example, is one of them.
However, we need preconditions.
Finally, another word to the Council.
We should also look ahead though.
We must not discriminate against them.

The debate was quite interesting.

Written statements (Rule 142)

This is not a secondary issue either.
The next item is the debate on:

Space is our new European frontier.
No one opposes this.
We are not trying to ignore that.
We have no operational funds.
Galileo has already been discussed.
Thank you for the floor, Mr President.
A few remarks are in order.
Space is our common and global asset.
Hence, it has relevance for Parliament.
This is only the beginning, however.
Thank you for the floor.
Its potential in this area is enormous.

We must not waste any more time.

I hope that this does not occur.
Why is this?

Written statements (Rule 142)
Question Time (Commission)
Part I
We prefer actions in a coordinated way.
You would be surprised.
This should be a priority.
I have seen this happen so many times.
Also, debate does not always convince.
Who will speak for the European Union?
Where does the responsibility lie?
We all have to be advocates.
We have never had that before.
This is what we are trying to do now.
I will be brief.
You need to tackle that issue.
I had understood it was 20 minutes.
I think that you are right.
Agreement is difficult.
Subject: Funding for green technology
I really cannot stay.
Mrs Doyle, I am not changing the order.
Subject: Cloning
I have only one question.
So they have the freedom to choose.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
That is quite clear.
My question was No 3 in a session.
Fifteen minutes were given to it.
I want my annoyance noted.
I find it very annoying.
In 2060, the ratio will be two to one.
Today they are still fit and healthy.


Long-term care: that comes later now.
It used to come in the 70s.
At 90, she needed a stair lift.
I shall describe a few of them.
Thank you, Madam President.
Europe's residents are getting old!
Thank you.
It has never got out of it.
This is also where the problem lies.
This is an ageing continent.
What is to be done?
There is a great deal to do.
Should we fear a shortage of labour?
(The President cut off the speaker.)
The replacement fertility rate is 2.16.
In Poland this rate is 1.2.
Many young families cannot afford this.
That would be regrettable.
The EU has an ageing population.
We all have to do everything possible.
It is only one additional problem.
The debate is closed.
That is the first important result.
It is also a win-win strategy.
That is a very timely message.
This item is now closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
How can this happen?
Clearly we cannot be complacent.
We have to keep up the momentum.

Nothing.
Complacency has set in.
Fear of infection has evaporated.
I was lucky.
I did not.
That is why I welcome this resolution.
Such prejudice is a sign of ignorance.
It is called the EDCTP.
It was so united and even passionate.
The debate is closed.
What we seek now is those reassurances.
I welcome the single CMO.
It will not become simpler.
This is bureaucracy in its purest form.

Will this be better for wine producers?
Those were my questions.
Thank you, Madam President.
That has got to be good.
On the contrary.
There will be separate chapters.
The debate is closed.
There would be no more strawberries.
It is essential that we act now.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
It is a serious issue.
Is it the use of pesticides?
Is it climatic conditions?
Europe is not short of expertise.
Is it pesticides, or some other reason?
Everyone has spoken about it.
It is really a multidisciplinary issue.
These are all current initiatives.
We are spending 80% of that money.

Why was Galileo not consolidated?
That is one of my concerns.
So this is good news.
Neither of these problems is new.
Where does Galileo begin and end?
That is very good news.
It is about taxpayers' money.
It is about European citizens' money.
We will not achieve this.
We can be pleased about this.

We do not want to hold a monologue.

I think that is a pity!
We must now convince the Council.
Times have changed since 2004 and 2006.
We really should be rather proud.
The system cannot work in this way.
Let us be honest.
We have not reached that stage yet.
Public trust in the EU is low.
This pattern is consistent.
Congratulations, Mrs Gr√§√üle!
Thank you, Mrs Gr√§√üle!
How far can they take this?
That should not be allowed.
I reject the accusation.

I would like to reject two points.
That happens frequently.
This applies to you too.
I have tried not to do this.
I would like to make this very clear.
Nothing happened at all.
That is a complete scandal!

Thank you, Madam President.

Thank you, Madam President.
I voted in favour.
That is why we have voted against.
A missed opportunity!
Political courage is urgently needed.
Here is a short anthology.
We shall be voting against.
The second is poverty.
This is far too high.
We must not dismiss these predictions.
That is why we have voted against.
That is why we decided to abstain.
Among other aspects, the resolution:

We may say we have heard it all.
Thank you for supporting that request.

Death penalty in Nigeria
They are our main allies.
This is of course a much wider issue.
This is an unacceptable situation.
We need to speak out about it.
Nigerian law does not allow torture.
Nevertheless, the police use torture.
Trials are lengthy.
It is also a form of class justice.
Humans have granted it to themselves.
The debate is closed.

3. The case of the al-Kurd family
I have had personal experience of this.

It does not.

The issue of balance is fundamental.

Wednesday
This statement includes the following:
Welcome
Welcome to the European Parliament.
(Applause)
That is not the issue.
This will be a difficult Council.
President of the Commission. - (FR).
What is our idea of Europe?
Let us be absolutely clear about this.
Parliament's support is essential.
Here too, we must be clear.
This is how it should be.
They deserve to be taken seriously.
We must get it right.
They would be wrong.
It is an imperative.
Member States have continued to ratify.
(Applause)
I know it is difficult.
My second point is this.
So how do we do this?
I am not saying that it will be easy.
Let us join forces and do it.
Well, it should be.
Let us continue with emissions trading.
And it must lead the way.
Leaders have a choice.
I thank him for his remarks.
You say that you support it.
This is very important.
I thank you for your comments on it.
The next move is up to the Presidency.
No one in Poland could agree to that.
The principles must be retained.
Now to the Treaty of Lisbon item.
I agree with Mr Karas.
We need to be clear here.
I sincerely welcome this.
The US is acting but Europe not.
Would it had been the other way around!
We can clearly see this.
Jo Leinen highlighted this fact.
We must retain these targets.
That is as far as we can go.
That was in response to Mr von Wogau.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
The EU is showing its true colours!
This is not enough.
Nonetheless, we hope it will go ahead.
Coordination is therefore essential.
We must avoid blowing hot and cold.
I agree.
We do not need more consultations.
We need regulations.
We know exactly what the problem is.
(Interruption from another Member)
I think that on that point we agree.
This is man-made.
There was a silence, a taboo.
Thank you.
They are not very well coordinated.
The first is strong enough action.
You mentioned the issue of VAT.
In this regard, I wish to thank you.
We are talking about all of that.
It is obvious.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
EU strategy on Roma (debate)
More needs to be done, though.
How can this be explained?
We must call a spade a spade.
It is a difficult problem.
We talk about schools, for example.
These are different problems.
How many opportunities have been lost?
We cannot have a real strategy.
We need to change approach.
There was a good reason for it.
We have done plenty of talking.
Many thanks for your comments.
The debate is closed.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
The next item is a joint debate on:
That vote is, in fact, still valid.
The ball is now in Israel's court.
Let us work together to achieve this.
That is what the Council is doing.
We will therefore continue.
We should really stick to the facts.
Yes, this cooperation will take place.
It cannot go on any longer.
Tomorrow salaries will not be paid.
I look forward to your responses.
How are we going to come back to it?
Their economy has been crushed.
There are 210 illegal settlements.
The list goes on.
It is not a matter of black and white.
It accepts a two-state solution.
I think that is wrong.
That is totally inappropriate.
That was in 2003. I did it myself.
You used the word 'urgency'.
We have asked for a deferment.
I am waiting and hoping.


That is unacceptable!
We will continue to do so, naturally.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
We have to work on this act.
A more European answer is needed.
Please go for it.
Today, we need to go further.
Secondly, access to public contracts.
There is no time to waste.
That makes me very happy.
Therefore, I welcome the EIB funding.
Finally, I would just add one point.
Women are a lot better at it.
Keep up the good work, I would say.
I agree with what Mrs Vlasto just said.
Who can be opposed to this?
Why have I chosen to quote Henry Ford?
I see this as important.
The debate is closed.

The regulation is limited in time.
It now runs until the end of 2010.
We have done it in a hundred days.
We will vote on it tomorrow.
It is already agreed.
We have found the money.
Commissioner Michel now has the floor.
Congratulations, Commissioner.
At present there is barely any at all.
Has it been confirmed?
(The President cut off the speaker)
It is not the structural response.
Progress has been made.
It is intended for emergency purposes.
I most truly do not.
The problem was raised by Mr Borrell.
I have just come back from Doha.
So we will have to fight.
Who might cooperate in this?
The same applies to fertilisers.
I obviously see this as important.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
How can fraud be stopped?
Full stop.
That is all the proposal lays down.
It should play a more leading role.
These countries cooperated well.
This is really beyond me.
There is also good news, though.
What we are debating is something else.
This has not been the case.
A great deal of money is involved.
We need this money.
He has his own competences.
That is not a problem.

It is no different in this case either.
And what is this opportunity?

This is good progress.
Mr Borloo is on his way here.
Afterwards we can discuss it.
Thank you very much, Mr Schulz.
(Protests)
The matter has been settled, Mr Schulz.
(Protests)
This is my request.
(Applause)
(Parliament accepted the proposal)
I hope so in any case.
We are in a kind of positive paradox.
The most obvious example is Poland.
That much was clear from the outset.
(Applause)
(Applause)
That is not the normal procedure.
Our Group has discussed this in depth.
Good luck!
We hope the outcome is successful.
That definitely cannot be so.
(Applause)
Our job is to turn up the heat.
The Council must keep its word.
This is a lamentable state of affairs.
Now is the time to find solutions.
It is a law of diminishing returns.
The damage will be vast.
That is our aim.
We need some movement there.
You mentioned the economic crisis.
But the criticism is clear.
There is a sales crisis everywhere.
(Applause)
What are we doing?
(Protests)
(Applause)
I am not that cheeky, however!
The science is a given.
Make no mistake about that.
Make no mistake about that.
This is unacceptable.
Firstly, the polluter must pay.
Poor countries are worried.
Thank you for your attention.
Parliament is ready.
Absolutely incomprehensible!
The CDM projects are a case in point.
I have just come back from China.
Personally, I have lost all faith.
I ask you: where is the fault in this?
Let me say a word about the process.
We cannot change our minds on this.
Now there is some catching up to do.
What do the Americans do?
What are we doing?
(Applause)
I think that shows responsibility.
Now is also such a difficult moment.
We have always been able to do that.
No one knows this better than Poland.
They need to plan their investments.
The rest is not much more than fantasy.
If they fail, we fail.
Secondly, we are running out of oil.
By doing so, Europe sets the tone.
That is not fair.
It must not be allowed to happen.
They must all have comparable shoes.
That is not in dispute at all.
That, Mr Dimas, we do not want.
Formal sitting - Dalai Lama
You also visited us in 2001 and 2006.
We will always defend this right.
(Applause)
(Applause)
But, since then I am OK, quite fit!
(Laughter)
I told them that I had nothing special.
No miracle power. No healing power.
We need different ways of approach.
Eventually the population increased.
(Laughter and applause)
Do you agree?
(Cries of 'Yes!')
Now to the Tibetan issue.
(Applause)
That is totally wrong.
That is totally wrong.
It is illogical.
Let me take one example.
That is their view.
Actually we are helping them.
So difficulties are bound to occur.
Now I have not much time.
I very much appreciate that.
Thank you very much.
(Loud and sustained applause)
(Loud and sustained applause)
(Applause)
But that says it all.
I think that is irresponsible.

As long as it is, it is just a tax.
This is crucial for jobs.
Now we will not even achieve 20%.
This concerns the methods, of course.
I am very grateful for this.

Health and safety is the issue here.
We think it should be phased out.
For a start it is not voluntary.
This is a challenge.
Thirdly - equality.
Who are the people working 60-65 hours?
This is a matter of health and safety.
We have tried to start negotiations.
The first being the opt-out.
Naturally, I did so.
They wanted a free market.
He called that the law of the jungle.
Well, thanks!
Quite!
So let us follow the French.
So what help do you offer her?
What hope do you offer her?
Nothing!
There is no escaping this.
We must face up to reality.
The issue is persistent long hours.
None of us want this.
Is that consistent, Commissioner?
That, of course, is not true.
We did not do that.
Why?
I hope that pragmatism prevails.
It is late, but better late than never.
Watch out for the traps.
I think some facts have to be accepted.
We are with the people.
After that we will negotiate.
We will negotiate on an equal footing.

Written statement (Rule 142)

That must not happen in future.

Toys Directive (debate)
Nevertheless, this created uncertainty.
No question.
Thank you.
Yes, you did hear right!
This is incomprehensible.
This must be stopped.
Compromise is not an option.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Lead in toy cars?
Soft toys that cause allergies?

I cannot imagine why you would do that.

The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
This is self-evident.

Let us not allow this to happen.

Thank you for the opportunity to speak.
Thank you.

Written statements (Rule 142)
It is a move in the right direction.
Thirdly, there is global harmonisation.
I was a shadow rapporteur then, too.
It should be given the time it needs.

Look at our motorways!
Thank you.
We support the report.
Let us call a spade a spade.

New priorities are necessary, however.
We must reduce emissions significantly.
We must reduce our dependence on oil.
Here?
Thank you very much.
I have a final thought.
What were we talking about then?
Thank you.
There are two lessons in all this.
That is a scientific absurdity.
That was called a large European loan.
Anything else would be untenable.
This entire system needs revising.
This is beyond me.
Excuse me? 1970?
That was when the EU was called the EC.
I was just quoting from the report.
We shall be watching carefully.
That is tragic for Europe.
Thank you for your attention.
This is what makes it so difficult.
We need to give it our support.
It is a lost opportunity.

Explanations of vote
Oral explanations of vote:
I welcome the Turmes report.
It is time to end the hypocrisy.
That is, perhaps, the route to success.
Let us hope it works.
(SL) Thank you for the floor.
Thank you.
What am I saying here?
However, I had to abstain.
It is morally wrong.
Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est!
Let me tell you a story.
Shame on the Socialists!
Why do I think this?
That does not depend on those people.
It needs action at EU level.
Written explanations of vote:
I voted in favour of Mr Turmes' report.
However, this time will soon end.
This is a purely voluntary commitment.
That is why we decided to abstain.
Why vote for an imperfect report?
To clarify:

Ireland is in the latter category.

We abstained on this.
And it has done so.
But they are being unrealistic.
Indeed, that is what it is.
That, however, is not enough.
I voted YES:
because it is a first step.
I therefore voted against it.
we must remain vigilant.
They have free trade union movements.
Does this problem exist, then?
These goals remain.
We have therefore chosen to abstain.
We have therefore chosen to abstain.
That is why we abstained.

Thank you, Madam President.
How can we enhance our effectiveness?
We totally agree with it.
That has been the key strategy.
I should like to raise an urgent point.
Parliament undertook this exercise.
There is no shortage of ideas.
Mr Obiols i Germ√† is right.
I also support that strongly.
What about the other six?
Is there a common position?
And, if not, why not?
This brings shame on China.
Why?
Well, five hours is not normal.
This review is on-going.
I think this movement is going on.
Yes, I think it is true.
This is a point that we have to take.

What kind of Europe do we want?
I think it is excellent.
I was able to use it as a threat.
I now come to Mr Deprez's question.
That is absolutely crucial.
How does it address these problems?
Does the Commission have such plans?
These exceptions should be removed.
It has nothing to do with the state.
Where do immigrants come from, though?
That is a fine source!
Thank you.
Thank you.

Thank you.

We will win.
We will achieve equality.
As a gay man, I am committed to that.
Thank you to the presidency.
I also come to sexual differentiation.
There must be a duty of care.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Thank you very much.
Your answer, Mrs Yade, is reassuring.
It is a consistent answer.
What, then, is the true nature of OLAF?
There is a long way to go.
Action is needed in this regard.
We have done our homework.
We need sound legislation, therefore.
Mr President, I will be brief.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Part one
Subject: Contingency plans for SMEs
It will also especially benefit SMEs.
Perhaps you would comment.
Subject: Combating terrorism
These are very important steps.
The envelope contains EUR 200 million.
That is all I can say at the moment.
I entirely agree.
I will begin with the second question.
Subject: White Paper on sport
We have heard your programme.
And this is very important.
Subject: Euro and inflation

Even so, its rate is close to 2%.
I think it is a success.
I should like to ask the Commissioner:
I will not delay the proceedings.
My question is two questions away.
Thank you for indulging me.
And if so, how do you see it?
Why?
How can the Commission stand over that?
(An intervention from the floor)
You have your opinion about that.
Normally it will be answered orally.
That is our frustration.
Thank you for your patience.
That concludes Question Time.
The next item is the joint debate on
That is the general context here.
What is it about, then?
We need to share experience.
Thank you.
This freedom is essential.
I think it even improves the text.
I would like to make one point.
This is very important for mobility.
Let us not stint on education.
We need older people.
I do not see any conflict.
Mr Ma≈°t√°lka is absolutely right.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Ladies and gentlemen, Frontex works.
I am grateful to Mr Moreno S√°nchez.
I think these words are clear.
So how can I be satisfied?
That would be asking the impossible.
How can we make FRONTEX more effective?
I wholly disagree.
Thank you.
This is not true at all.
That is totally false!
I cannot allow that to be said.
That is what I wished to say.
We must not forget that.
I regard that as added value.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
The next item is the joint debate on:
It would have a dual focus.
Thank you.
Enhanced cooperation is required.
I would stress this point.
Madam President, I am finishing now.
Thank you for your attention.
Thus, we must not prejudge.
Thank you.
Excellent!
That is an excellent idea.
Thank you.
This is what I am concerned about.
Thank you very much.
There should be no doubt about that.
That was your oversight.
That was the Commission's oversight.
We are waiting for that time to come.
I am speaking of his report.
We must take action!

No!
Can there be borderless justice?
As you said, no, again!
Again, of course, no!
A portal for information: yes!
Exchange of data: yes!
In order to achieve these...
Indeed, this is what they expect of us.
This is the Commission's response.
It cannot be recognised beyond that.
Look at it, please understand it.
It has been fabulous.
Thank you.
You will be missed.
For many of us it was too short.
That was my only difference of opinion.

We have not made it easy for ourselves.
We have reached a good compromise.
Nobody can quantify the risk.
They would dilute this compromise.
Neurotoxic substances, for example.
In theory this may work.
In practice we need to make this work.
We have a precedent.
You should read the agreement!
Please look at it again.
Our rapporteur is on the right track.
That is what is proposed.
I do not believe that that will happen.
Worse is better!
Let me tell you now.
It is icy out there - that is a hazard.
You can legislate for neither of them.
It will damage food production.
It will put farmers out of business.
That, too, is important.
This will be a credit to Parliament.
I come from a very wet country.
GM is based on disrupting DNA.

Alcohol, pure alcohol, is a hazard.
Probably not!

It started before the financial crisis.
The Green Paper led to a public debate.
My scepticism gives way to concern.
It is marked by a certain nonchalance.
This has largely happened.
Many obstacles were removed in 2001.
We have already heard comments on this.
We are aware of the different opinions.
That is crucial.
Thank you very much.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.

Without them, there would be no euro.

But this is no time for complacency.
I would like to mention three of them.
Firstly, the financial crisis.
Secondly, monetary union.
Thirdly, enlargement.
We are now 16 countries.
The euro is an historic achievement.
New challenges are arising.
(Applause)
We are expecting others to join us.
It is not a normal situation.
It has gained the world's trust.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This is no mere bagatelle.
He did not persuade us.
Three major changes have taken place.
This target may seem a bit absurd.
What remains to be done then?

It is all delusional stuff.
Spain is in economic trouble.
There is nothing it can do.

We must and should rejoice in that.

I am honoured to have this opportunity.
These were significant changes.
I am very proud of these words.
What has our nation gained?
No!
No!
Of course not!
That is indeed what happens.
The market regulates itself.
Unfortunately, we have awoken too late.
They are becoming more and more urgent.
Let us look into the future.
In 2015, say?
One of them will be the European Union.
Those are still wise words today.
It will consolidate its value system.
It is how our work will be judged.
It is our responsibility.

That is certainly true.
Thank you.

This is not in dispute.
I agree with the aims of this report.
I share their concerns.

We are living in a new era.
That is why we abstained.
I voted against this report.
That is why we have voted against.
How would this mindset be defined?
I therefore voted against this report.
The reverse is true!
I voted in favour of this report.
It is a very difficult vote.
We cannot legislate in the abstract!
That is why we have voted against.
I do not think I need to go on further.
That is not yet the case.
That was decided in 2004.
We voted against biometrics in visas.
Of course, this will carry a price tag.
How would that be monitored?
Thank you very much.
We should not even be discussing that.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
The first is about the Council.
This is a very important point!
So let us do that.
This would not do.
It can already be seen, Mr Cappato.
That is what we need to get back to.
Why?
Good luck, Marco.
I applaud Mr Cappato's initiative.
I support the Cappato report.
I agree with much of the report.
I have one or two caveats.
This is crucial.
Then I did what so many citizens do.
Where does the money go?
Who receives it?
This was also my experience.
This is, of course, impossible.
I have no fear of transparency.
I welcome this initiative.
That is not true.

Nine missions have already ended.

We have succeeded in that.
They deserve our acceptance.
Why was that?
The same goes for reducing corruption.
We owe this to our citizens.
For this I am particularly grateful.
We need to go further along this road.
Thank you very much.
It will be a brake on R&D.
One word on offsetting.

Subject: Microcredits

I think it is a big gap in the market.
Subject: Cybercrime

That is what I can tell you.
Subject: Terrorist threats
That is my answer to Mr Aylward.
His findings will be available soon.
We will work on this.
Subject: EU immigration policy



(The President cut off the speaker)
Where is this debate at?
And that is what has occurred.
Subject: Financial crisis
There will be a recovery in Europe.
It also results in discrimination.
Thank you very much.
The second one is counterfeiting.
Manufacture would then be licence-free.
Let this be a lesson to us.
Could the Commissioner comment, please?
This is simply a criminal act.
This happens in several Member States.
Yes, it does exist.
This is where the problem lies.
The debate is closed.
It is easy to be affected by it.
This bodes well.
Industrial use is a different matter.
Why?
It is a water-based alternative.
Well done, Carl!
In the end, this is quite acceptable.
By and large, this is a good agreement.
Yes, we can!
Let us now go further.
It has been a hard road to get to this.

Thank you for the good coordination!
Explain these two visits to me.
European coordination is required.
We import 99% of our nuclear fuels!
There is also the Turkish issue.

I voted against it.

I therefore voted against the report.
I voted in favour of the report.

None, of course.
I am voting in favour.

A cease-fire is what we want!
This is extremely important.

Many thanks, Mrs Morgantini.
This is just a small first step.
Nothing.

In my opinion, the answer is yes.
It ought to have done more.
Mr President, I really am finishing.
The answer is most certainly 'No'.
This was a tragic mistake!
(Applause)
Let UNWRA carry out its mission.
Stop arms exports to Israel.
So, it is time to get down to work!
Mr President, I abhor terrorism.
The situation is demonstrably clear.
Israel accepts a two-state solution.
Stop shelling Israel.
So what are our next moves?
They are not new.
I wish you a very warm welcome!
We need dialogue!
Why are they voting for Hamas?
That is the only real requirement.
(Applause)
'They break your heart.'
It is evil.
It is evil.
Yes, the Hamas rockets must stop.
We also went to Egypt.
This was complicity by anticipation.
Lastly, Israel is not a special case.
(Applause)
The question answers itself.
(Applause)
There was no hypocritical umbrage.
Proportional indeed!
Today we are condemning Israel.
Would that be proportionality?
But is there any other solution?
If there is, tell me.
There is no other way.
Yet we have provided no added value.
What is the Council doing at this time?
Nobody cares about them.
How about those on the ground?
What can we do?
How can we pass from words to deeds?

This must stop.
It should be implemented without delay.
It is an issue of proportionality.
So they should.
I do not think it is yet time to do so.
I have seen it in Africa.
I have seen it in Ireland.
I have seen it in many places.
That happens.
I know how difficult the question is.
What can be done to stop Israel?
Let us be frank - very little.
The European Union can help there.
No.
But do not overstate our possibilities.
We need the resolve of the USA.
We have leverage.
We are a major trading partner.
We are a major funder in that region.
So we are able to exercise that role.
We can do a lot and we must.
What actually happened?
It is time to end this unfortunate war.
We are waiting here.
Has it been deleted from the agenda?
That is the next item on the agenda.
But the death toll is rising.
Speaking to Hamas is difficult.
There is movement in any case.
Hopefully things will go forward.

At the same time, I do not take sides.

But do they want a solution?
We have done our part.
This is the immediate crisis.
What next?
One is the lack of interconnection.
What action could we take in response?
Yet these, too, will not just appear.
Enough of this!
This policy has failed.
The man is a gangster'.
There are huge savings to be achieved.
I should not think so.

I wonder why it is so.

So we need to step up the pressure.

That really is unacceptable.

The problem is journey times.
That is what we need to address.

How can these developments be verified?
Do you have any proof, and if so, what?
What figures do you have?
How are the long journeys monitored?
That, too, requires some thought.

That is an area we need to look at.

Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
All this after a big gas crisis!
What, however, must we do?

(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you very much.
That concludes the item.
This is a hugely important round.

We would welcome him.

What can we expect from China?
There are many worrying signs.
We are seeing the first signs.
This may be the beginning.
The trends are clear to see.
This really will be disastrous.
There are grounds for pessimism.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak.
We have seen this throughout history.
Thank you very much.
I think we should remember that.
Perhaps I am wrong.
I have read the legislation.
I too am very concerned about it.


I agree this is very important.
I could not agree more with that.
The debate is closed.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I am very grateful.
- The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
- The next item is the joint debate on:
What are the lessons to be learnt?
What were the weaknesses we discovered?
I believe this is the right proposal.
What are we proposing?
We basically know what must be done.
That would be ideal.
Now, at what level?
Of course, we started with research.
Upfront, there are costs.
One example is the Southern Corridor.
That did not happen.
That cannot be solidarity.
We need to develop more biofuels.
I would like to conclude on that note.
This is totally unacceptable.
This is totally unacceptable.
Thank you.
There is talk of long-term measures.
Secondly, there is renewable energy.
Thirdly, there is gas to tide us over.
How is that supposed to happen?
Just look at the facts!
Not a penny for energy efficiency!
Not a penny for town-twinning!
(CS) Thank you, I shall be brief.

In fact the opposite is true.
It is very important.
What does it mean?
It is very important for us.
This is thus a very serious issue.
We need smart meters now.
Thank you.
These proposals should be rejected.
That would be irresponsible.
The answer is technology.
It is also agreeing to investment.
We are not speaking with one voice.
(The President cut off the speaker)
What can be done now?
Thank you very much.
We know the answers.
I want to draw attention to two issues.
We hope for your understanding.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
In Europe we pay around USD 400.
A lot of you spoke about the supergrid.
That will solve a lot of issues.
What is the Council discussing?
I think there are basically two issues.

What are the energy sources?
All that is for 2030.
- Thank you, Mrs Laperrouze.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.

Thank you.
They are often left without help.
Thank you very much.
We must achieve this.
Thank you.
This concerns every aspect of life.
It is disagreement with evil.'
Cooperation is needed from the media.
This is a reproach of our times.
A stranger arouses interest.
Are we, as parents, helpless?
No, we are not.
It is such a simple message.



I will say no more on this.
That is the current thinking.
There is also a need for tools.
This is fundamental.
Firstly, there is a lack of data.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
Written statements (Rule 142)
We must raise the level of protection.
We really must.
Personally, I do not see any drawbacks.
We attacked incentive.
Thank you.
That too, my group will accept.
We needed something different.
We needed a measure to curb xenophobia.
Well, it is not surprising is it?
We do not want that either.
This is a well-balanced directive.
No one disputes this.
This is cowardly and unhelpful.
We have taken the first step forward.
There is a shameful paradox here.
Congratulations, therefore, to Mr Fava.
What will become of them?
This is what we know as modern slavery.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr Fava is certainly to be commended.
Nonetheless, the law is not working.
Do not complain that the Union...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Why has it not been included?
They have become illegal workers.
The latter often exploit their despair.
It seems to me to be a good first step.
There you have it.

Written explanations of vote
The overwhelming vote shows just this.
I am opposed to any military use.

I agree entirely with this proposal.
I did so for exactly the same reason.
Russia cannot be separated from Europe.
These are distinct.
I voted in favour of the report.
I therefore supported this report.
I voted in favour of this report.
Europe spends USD 2.5 billion.
Thank you, Mr President.
I shall vote in favour.
Not only that.
There are pros and cons.
The nuclear debate is never-ending.
We need to develop other energy sectors
Thank you, Mr President.
I am voting in favour.
Each state defends its own interests.
It must be decided at EU level.
This is a lesson for the future.
We must put it into practice.
I draw two conclusions from this.
I voted against the resolution.
Thank you, Mr President.
I voted in favour.

We must also put an end to sex tourism.
This is now under way.

This decision is important.
We must also do that in this case.
This is the wrong message.
It is a place of torture.
(Applause)
These are no ordinary inmates.
This is unacceptable!
I regard this as a cynical approach.
Thank goodness for that.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak.
Why?
That is not 'returning to terrorism'.
Thank you very much.
The ends do not justify the means.
(NL) President Obama has kept his word.
This is based purely on assumptions.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The European Union must collaborate.
However, one thing must be made clear.
We should think carefully about that.
We look away; we turn our back.
Someone today spoke about refugees.
These are not refugees.
This has been said in this Parliament.
How is the European Union involved?
These are classic asylum cases.
I believe it was very useful.
It is certainly more complex than that.
There is also the tactical debate.
This is one level.
It has only been one week.
This really is the essential condition.
That is absolutely essential.
Thank you everyone.
The debate is closed.
I now turn to Mayotte.
This should be open in June 2011.
It is all empty words and no action.
The lack of solidarity is shocking.
How will it be spent?
We have known this for three years.
What is the consequence of this?
76 requests were examined in 3 days.
I have nearly finished, Mr President.
Enough then of demagoguery!
The same must be done in Italy.
I want to make this very clear.
We should not help them.
What has been said is false.
Maroni exposed this.
This should be our main objective.
- (MT).
Thank you.
There are strategic issues.
That is absolutely essential
That is not possible.
That is not the aim of this fund.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Part one
Subject: EU-Israel trade relations

Subject: Internet safety programme
His contract has now been extended.
My question is as follows.
That is the main idea.
We are interested in looking.
You mentioned Heysel.
I read about it in the newspapers.
I do not know anything about Heysel.
Nothing has been decided.
It is a process.
It will be a transparent process.
So it is closely monitored.
The roles are divided.
So this has been promised at least.
The system is as follows.
This is one internal part.
There is also improvement in this area.
So the situation is improving.
We can show what has been done.
But 11% represented EUR 462 million.
This is a mess, Commissioner!
These samples amount to EUR 63 million.
These are the possible fraud cases.
Would you support this idea?
Could you repeat the question?
All of them are invited, of course.
This was a really big achievement.
That seems to me to be a good step.
Subject: Future EU-Iceland relations
This is my opinion.
Subject: Demography report
Certainly care-giving is one of those.
Subject: Poverty in the European Union
That concludes Question Time.
That is what I can tell you.
Thank you.
(Applause)
They share this view.
Each social group is different.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
(The speaker continued in Basque)
Their loyalty has been unbroken.
(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you very much.
The European Union has competencies.
Thank you.
Why are there double standards?
That is as much as I am able to say.
The Member States will not allow us to.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
This is not acceptable.
I do not have another passport.
I do not have another country.
That is an aberration.
How is that possible?
They do not participate.
They do not take decisions.
These people are called non-citizens.
This is, quite simply, unacceptable.
Those languages were simply banned.
I take exception to that.
Why that is, I do not know.
What does that mean?
Thank you.
I am from Ireland; I speak English.
We have had to deal with that.
Do not reject it.
You can take citizenship.
Well, that is quite sad.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What is Russia's part in all this?
Unfortunately, that is all I can say.
The debate is closed.

The report is also honest.
That is the wonderful thing about it.
I am particularly pleased about that.
Nor does it disparage any area.
We can and must reach an agreement.
There is no time to lose.
However, that alone will not be enough.
Considerable investments are needed.
Our fourth core theme is agriculture.
Together, we can achieve a great deal.
The Minister is flying to India today.
But this planet has finite resources.
The market is there.
The regulatory framework is clear.
The jobs and wealth will flow.
We have the technology patented.
Green technology is our future.
This is not sustainable.
Thank you very much.
They were wrong.
They were wrong.
They were wrong.
Nothing at all happened.
It, too, is wrong.
Nor is it a consensus.
We are looking at a lifestyle change.
We are failing in not being consistent.
Devastation will come to agriculture.
There are options here, too.
They are needed here.
Do you not understand this?
I would recommend it to them.
There is not much time left.
We need to think long term.
Thank you.
This is completely short-sighted.
The word 'creation'.
Why?
Because creation has a creator.
This has been our great achievement.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Bravo.
What a climatic masterstroke.
Extra CO2 will have no more effect.
There is no problem.
What is needed from us today?
This is the right approach, in my view.
As such, we will oppose this paragraph.
A great deal can be done there.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Miracles rarely happen.
Let us go beyond discussion.
What is needed?
What sort of things, for example?
Quite the opposite.
Great importance must...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Scientific research is our basis.
We know how important.
I think this was a mistake.
Not at all.
Why the six 'wins'?
Let us consider the ambition.
This concludes my statement.

We have discussed this here today.
Once again, you have my sincere thanks.

Today that was once again not the case.
Oral explanations of vote
I do not support the report.
I do not agree with this.
There is no progress without water.
We need to rationalise water usage.
I do not share this view.
Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est.
It is nonsense.
We talk about climate change.
We talk about energy efficiency.
I will not be holding my breath.
Are we mad?
They are not exactly squeaky clean.
This is problematic, to say the least.
They have shown the will.
They have listened to us.
Written explanations of vote
Climate change is a fact.
The major defects are financial.
This is absurd.
The report is very sprawling.
I wish you all a good day.
I thank you all.
This can bring numerous benefits.
I voted for the Florenz Report.
Let us make the effort.
However, I have some reservations.
This report has various merits.
The resolution, however:
Now, each prisoner should stand trial.
Mr Lundgren, I am now cutting you off.
I believe that it is clear to everyone.
This is the great difference.
Kosovo (debate)
I think that this is unfair.
This has been welcomed by the Council.
This work is very important.
We are caught up in this.
I should like to underline two things.
We should not add fuel to the fire.
- (SV) I was born in the Balkans.
(Applause)
That is exactly what Kosovo needs.
I very much hope so.
It was a harsh lesson.
Serbia has one more chance: Vojvodina.
We await an explanation.
There is no follow-up organisation.
EULEX itself cannot do this job.
It was excellent.
There is no easy solution.
Once again, thank you very much.
We will continue this cooperation.
The debate is closed.
We should be proud of Europe's record.
Why is this the case?
Not one.
It is just not possible to do this.
We are doing that.
We have already done all of this.
And what happens?
Some do one thing, others do another.
These tasks overlap with one another.
Swift, firm action is needed.
There is a solution.
What we need is a green New Deal.
That is coming back to haunt them now.
In fact it is simply crazy.
We must not go along with this.
Volvo and Saab are well-known makes.
There is no time to lose, Commissioner.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This was the case for coal and steel.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Minister, you have the floor.
That is the bottom line.
Let me make that quite clear.
I do not know.
That is absolutely impossible.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
What action can be expected?
Mr Vondra has already gone into this.
That, then, is the situation on paper.
It is not an option, it is a right.
This is the least we can do.
It is a pertinent question.
It is extensive but not exhaustive.
More work needs to be done there.
Mumbai will happen again.

That would be rather ambitious.
Thank you.

I am anti-smoking, not anti-smokers.
They are amazing really.
Parliament is sovereign.
So I have a dilemma.
It is also an ecological disaster.
The Council is not here this evening.

Recycling is now 'the thing to do'.
We do not think outside the box.
Of course, this is about Ireland.
In other words, those controls worked.
What has been the effect of this?
Traceability, however, must be ensured.
That I understand.
We need to look at that issue.
This has been an appalling episode.
No one would have wished it to happen.




That is not the issue.
We cannot deny that.
This is not political.
So this is serious stuff.
I have here some figures.

This dossier does add value.
Parliament has had a good day today.
Only two big questions remain.
Sadly, the answer is 'no'.
They must be adequately protected.
Cannibalism: never again!
Industry will do everything for profit.
The food in Europe is safe.
I should like to return to this.

This report has been a long haul.
I believe this is a good report.
That is why this is a good arrangement.
Here, too, this was very successful.

I voted against in both cases.
It is understandable.
I voted in favour of this report.
1.
Situation in Sri Lanka
The Red Cross has raised the alarm.
Recently, a journalist was killed.
In fact, things are much more complex.
They fear death or injury.

The population is suffering enormously.
There is a shortage of everything.
Moreover, we issue a warning to Hamas.
Let us, however, be clear.
There is no military solution.
There is no solution through terrorism.
So there is hope in Washington.
What about Jerusalem, though?
This asynchronicity poses a risk.
What is going on in Lebanon?
Your work deserves more than respect.

Thank you very much, Mr Schulz.
We cannot go on like this.

Explanations of vote
Written explanations of vote
The next item is the joint debate on:
Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you very much.
That is the question.
It was very much self-inflicted.
Immobility is our big problem.
What do we have to do?
We have to get our act together.
Why do we not use it more efficiently?
The CFSP is more than an instrument.
This is very important.
More engagement will be needed.

Thank you for your attention.
These are things that we welcome.
Mr Solana, you are absolutely right.
We believe this is wrong.
What wars will be next?
NATO stands for the politics of war.
No!
NATO stands for insecurity!

Is it fiction?
This is essential, after all.
To begin with, resources and means.
Someone spoke about helicopters.
This would actually be helpful.
We used to call it 'hearts and minds'.
Mr Allister is a typical example.
That approach is antiquated.
We have the resources.
Will we, one day, have the will?
NATO, however, is constantly expanding.
NATO has had its time.
We really are pushed for time.
Afghanistan is also an important issue.
It does not appear that way to me!
Thank you.
Let us not waste it.
Firstly, on values.
They guide us in our behaviour.
Secondly, on institutions.
Do you not agree with me, Mr Solana?
Perhaps he is not listening.
Obviously I understand Commissioner.
Not much, apart from act as witnesses.
We know this is a very important part.
Is there progress in this area?
Yes.
Is it enough?
No.
The answer is, again, 'yes'.
The answer is 'no'.
I have already touched upon finance.
The question of values was raised.
Do we agree on values?
It gets more identity.
This has been very controversial.
We have to learn from our mistakes.
That is a noble cause.
Yes, we are pacifists.
Who is not a pacifist?
Anybody of sound mind is a pacifist.
Who wants suffering; who wants war?
We must be proactive.
Let me make one last comment.
The debate is closed.

Thank you!
These are important.
For several reasons.
And who knows?
It was a conference on water.
This is how crucial it is.
Let me give you an example.
We have done a lot on this issue.
Can this new partnership bear fruit?
There must be a clear strategy.
I think we have observer status too.
The challenges are absolutely enormous.
We know that we do not.
Where are we now?
We just need to move.
So I think we are ready.
All the acquis is there then.
We have worked a great deal on that.
Do not worry then.
Fortunately, everything is there.
That is the only difference.
Why?
Thank you all for this debate.

Written statements (Rule 142)
How should we treat such leaders?
This is what local autonomy means.
The problems we face are European.

However, let us be honest.
I think that is really true.
That should not happen.
We must answer this question.
Ukraine may serve as an example.
We must set a real example.
Let me just say a few things.
Time is against us.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.

What are these non-ODA activities?

The vote will take place tomorrow.

We shall see what it does with it.
Listening to you was music to my ears!
Thank you.
Well, you present me with a quandary.
One minute.
I have two quick points.
I think there is no simple answer.
That is really the only way ahead.
I am, however, quite optimistic.
In essence, that is the story.
I have forgotten cohesion.
The answer is yes.
We need infrastructure.
We need it as soon as possible.
We have looked into the technicalities.
We take note of this comment.

Explanations of vote
(Oral explanations of vote)
So I had to vote against it.
Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est.
This must change.
This needs to be undertaken urgently.

How can anyone understand that?
It was worth the effort.
That is the decision we have to make.
It has to be a balance.
They did not succeed.
That mandate expires on 15 March 2009.
How are we seeking to undermine this?

(Written explanations of vote)
That is why we decided to abstain.
This is unacceptable.

We have therefore decided to abstain.
I support the rapporteur's motion.
I voted in favour of this report.

I have, however, some reservations.
I voted against this report.
That is why I will abstain.
That is very unfortunate.
This is exactly as to be expected.
I voted to abstain on this report.
We therefore voted against the Report.
I therefore elected to abstain.
I take a contrary view.
That is why I will be voting 'no'.
I am talking about NATO.
That is why we voted against.

Mr Cohn-Bendit?

Thank you very much.
That was the justification.

Mr President, I shall make it brief.
I would ask for your support.
Thank you.
Darfur is now an item on the agenda.
(The order of business was adopted)
It can either make it or break it.
We also visited the Gaza Strip.
(Applause)
That cannot be allowed to happen!
(The President cut off the speaker)
It was no ordinary match.
They are important subjects.
(BG) Thank you, Madam President.
We are fighting, we are not troubled.
(BG) Thank you, Madam President.
It is intolerable and very serious.
This matter only seems trivial.
They expect it of us.
The debate is closed.
This is now our greatest concern.
Thank you, Madam President.
There are numerous examples.
Thank you.
Firstly, the emphasis on lawmaking.
This is, of course, election year.
I hope so.
The difference in magnitude is absurd.
The same applies to energy policy.
What is your justification for this?
They expect us to provide assistance.
How is that possible?
We have a budget of EUR 1.5 billion.
They should be nothing very grand.
This budget points beyond itself.
Today there is something else at stake.
We need the Union.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 142)

The next item is the joint debate on:
My sincere thanks for your attention.
For that source continues to be credit.
We are now really in a critical phase.
We are grateful for your support.
It is designed for SMEs.
These reasons are still valid.
Finally, I would like to say that
Small is beautiful.
Bureaucracy must be nipped in the bud.
We need to act quickly on this.
Why do I say inadequate?
Today, then, we must go further.
This shows how well we did our work.
It is not restricted to size.
This has not been done.
I will take two examples.
Second example: red tape.
It amounts to a revamped Bolkestein.
What is needed now is a rethink.
That is my greatest concern.
Labour rights must not be violated.
However, I have two reservations.
The debate is closed.
I see many friends of SMEs here.
This benefits no one but lawyers.
My second point concerns participation.
Thank you very much for your support.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
The truth is specific.
Allow me to be specific.
I have some answers for you.
You mentioned mixed flows.
Where should they disembark?
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Why, I ask myself.
I find that unacceptable.
And who can blame them?
Vice-President of the Commission. -?

Can the Commissioner please comment?
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
This technique is not science fiction.
Such an approach is not constructive.
Please support the compromises!
Thank you.
This unacceptable situation must stop.
What are we doing here?
That is exactly where we have to go.
I think this is a shame.
Al Gore has left a clear mark.
Soil protection is important.
It represents a good compromise.

So far, so good.
We have to be consistent.

Please convince me otherwise.
I do not think this is a good idea.
I have a lot of sympathy for that.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
So the link is already there.
We need to lead by example.
We should have electronic voting...
(The President cut off the speaker)
I do not know what to say.

This is completely unacceptable.
You do know what should really be done.
Asking questions like this is allowed.
We do all agree on the objective.
Is that what you want?
That is the basis of democracy.
The principles of democracy demand it.
I rest my case.
We become more vulnerable.
Go back and look at the report.
The space to think.
Official documents.
Go back to the report.
Accept our principles.

Mr President, I shall be brief.
I have an additional point.
It must be rejected.
I cannot accept that.

So I asked my pensioners.
Alas, this is obviously not that place.
We see similar packages in America.

It is, rather, a tragedy.
The next item is the joint debate on:
This measure targets hulks.

Parliament played its part back then.
Yet it is clear that it was necessary.
(Applause)
The negotiation process was difficult.
Let me make two more points, however.
This was not heeded.
I will try again.
These reports need a real overhaul.
How democratic is that?

I do have one regret.
I am pleased at that.
Thank you, Mr Ortuondo Larrea.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Comments please, Commissioner.
All the best, then.
So much for the correction.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 142)
We therefore have to do something.
What are the essential points?
This is optional, not obligatory.
This must be the ultimate objective.
No one on earth could understand that.
Congestion, though?
There is no point in that.
What are you actually proposing?
You say there are many options.
No, you are the Commission!
Hence my puzzlement.
The report is clearly critical.
Let us not deceive ourselves.
No European charges are to be imposed.
Amendment of the agenda
Thank you.
The rapporteur is in favour.
(The President cut off the speaker)
They are hit while going to the market.
It is not!
You can't have it both ways, however.
That is a social democratic concept.
Nobody will be forced to do so.
We have come a long way.
That is unfair competition.
That is just madness.
That is why we need this directive.
We need the true reflection of costs.
Then they will be credible.
Firstly, it has come too soon.
So much for hypothecation.
He has done a fine job.
He has dealt with hundreds of comments.
Thank you.
Noise would add 1.1 euro cents to this.
The first I address to Mr Evans.
We believe this is reasonable.
That, surely, cannot be right!
That is not on.
Thank you very much.
Question Time (Commission)
Part One
The Ecofin today came to a compromise.

My second question is as follows.
We began late and we will finish late.
Mr President, I do.
My apologies.
I misunderstood the point you made.
Subject: The Internet and hate crimes
I would like to thank the Commissioner.
You can see a lot of the work they do.
What, at long last, is to be done?
It is important.
Thank you Commissioner.
That concludes Question Time.
I think that is true.
Home childcare is important.
Thank you ever so much.

Statements by the President
These acts of terrorism shock us all.
This is what Jean Monnet said in 1954.
(Applause)
However, my speech is an appeal.
Most will do so from 2010.
We want this summit to be ambitious.
We cannot afford it to fail.
(Applause)

Look at the financial system.
Just look at energy security.
This is central to what we are doing.
We need to use this time well.
Unfortunately, it is far from over.
What should we do, then?
We know very well what.
We have talked about lifelong learning.
Now we come to the social consequences.
In conclusion, we must act.
(Applause)
It must not be a routine summit.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We must make the necessary decisions.
This means that jobs are being lost.
You must do more!
These initiatives are urgently needed.
It is wonderful.
You seem suddenly to have woken up.
(Applause)
So recession must not mean inaction.
If differences persist, it will not do.
Europe can fight fire no longer.
It is a vicious circle.
They are simply more of the same.
Europe must take a different route.
I want to call that into question.
We do not have the money.
He has lost his marbles!
Unfortunately, that is the case.
(Applause)
We are coming with less than half.
If we do not do that, we will lose.
My final point concerns solidarity.
Let us show solidarity in real terms.
What are we seeing again today, though?
Mr Daul is quite correct.
What we need is exactly the opposite.
We did not have these things, however.
The imbalances are therefore huge.
Could we have a better target?
Could we have a better delivery?
We need to mobilise actors to act.
Action, action, action, and delivery.
Let us act together.
(LV) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
Reform of this kind is long overdue.
(Interjection from the floor)
It is now or never for Europe.
This work is now on the table.
Thank you.
Congratulations, Mr Kirilov.
Let me give you one example.
This, of course, is not by chance.
Europe must not let them down.
Let us follow it with courage.
This should be an exception, though.
I am opposed to this.
Thank you for your attention.
We should really restrict bureaucracy.
It will make Lisbon a reality.
Martin Schulz is perfectly right.
Of course, we already knew that.
We are all aware of this.
Will you vote in favour?
Will you vote in favour?
I will be really brief.
No one in the Chamber has said that.
This is quite simply a fact.
We are in complete agreement on this.
The group will vote in favour of this.
Let me give one example.
I think that is premature.
We all know that.
It is now that we need to do this.
We cannot wait until the summit in May.
(Applause)
Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Employment guidelines were set out.

I know this, because I am from Poland.
I fully agree with her.

I shall say a few words on Cyprus.
We are in a difficult situation.
We will make progress.
They must remain outside the framework.
This is not about opening chapters.
This needs to change.
This needs to change.

Freedom of speech must be guaranteed.
This is very important.
This is our joint responsibility.
We need a more pragmatic approach here.
This was not the case, unfortunately.
This has not happened.
We see this very clearly.
However, what we see is something else.
That shows how far behind we are.
Turkey is Asia, not Europe.


I ask everyone to resist that.
Let us therefore pull the plug.
This is a scandal.
We must remember one obvious fact.
Turkey is a country in Asia Minor.
This is also reflected in this report.
These are major reforms.
Turkey should address this issue.
We need a positive atmosphere.
Thank you.
Progress is too slow, though.

Question Time (Council)
Subject: Unemployment in Europe

It is ridiculous to ban it internally.
Subject: Climate change
My feeling is that I have read this.
Subject: Road safety
We want to move the debate forward.
This one is somewhat behind.
It concerns the health professionals.
This is, of course, impossible.
This is unheard of, of course.
This sector is very important.
We need them more every year, not less.
That is the other side of the coin.

So what will Europe say at Istanbul?

That is very important.
There is an outreach - a greater offer.
That is crucial.
I have always been in favour of that.
Therefore, we have to design.
It is a principal question.
We have to bring that together.
This move encourages hope.

For Europe it is very beneficial.
We have to go further.
Thank you for your attention.

We should examine this path carefully.

What is really happening?
That did not happen in the past.
This should not happen.
Africa does not need to be controlled.
Instead, it needs our help and support.
I hope that we will get there.
It will not be easy.
We do not intend to reopen DAC issues.
I do not think that is the case.

I can give you the answer.
That is not dialogue.
That is an abdication of democracy.
That is democracy in action.
I am sorry, but this is madness.

There was a relatively strong turn-out.
We have agreed even on this.
We therefore need better regulation.

We are considering this.
This is not a technocratic agenda.
I am very happy with that result.
We have some instruments.

This is a false choice.
For Europe it is yet to come.
(Applause)
So, why did Roosevelt win?
The first was reregulation.
Secondly, strengthen the social fabric.
We do not want to go to war.
Therefore, there are two issues.
One is that we need green Eurobonds.
It has no desire to do so.
Bingo, Mr Delors!
That is precisely what they are.
That too is democracy.
That is point number one.
The system quite simply works.
That would not be a good thing.
The job summit.
The Lisbon Treaty.
I will allow myself one joke today.
The Commission.
Workforce mobility.
This is the barrier to a solution.
Yes, EUR 5 billion, but what is that?
I ask myself: how is that?
Well, the calculation is simple.
Please, we cannot do it in this way.
You cannot do it in this way.
What we need is real investment.
It will still be there.
(Applause)
Thank you for your attention.
That surprises me.
Cuts need to be made during the crisis.
I do not understand that.
Living on credit is the problem.
Ahead of us lie many tasks.
How can this be achieved?
We have endlessly squandered resources.
- Thank you, Mrs Harms.
You are quite right.
That is the question.
The Lisbon Treaty is old hat.
We need a new treaty for a new time.
That dogma is completely wrong.
At present they are only proposals.
That is what we have here.
It will now be a troika meeting.
We could discuss that for many hours.
That is what the European Union is for.
Now we need real action.
This must not be allowed to happen!
Why not the Czech Republic?
Why not Ireland?
I wish us all success in this matter.
That is an arrogant statement.
Will they never learn?
Is this a lot or too little?
Is the glass half full or half empty?
The first, of course, is jobs.
Is it enough?
Is it too little?
Is it a match for what is at stake?
Determined to do what?
That was postponed until May.

I voted in favour of the report.
This is not a satisfactory development.
This concern has our support.
However, there must be some safeguards.
I claim that this is not just history.
On climate, this year will be critical.
We must seize this opportunity.
Then we too shall have no problems.
What exactly does that Act state?
Let us take that point on board.
We still do not know that.
One is the trade dispute agenda.

The strategic context has changed.
I will continue to have my doubts.
So what is the main problem?

Avoid changing language when you speak.
Clearly give references to documents.
We would like to see a revision clause.
It can be reduced to a simple formula.
So, how should we do this?
That is uncontested.
That is the point.
That has not been delivered.

We must also be very careful.

I will not give you the floor.
The point of order has been clarified.
Only then does it make sense.
To that end, monitoring is required.

In fact it was our proposal.
This is a guarantee which we all share.
That is the hallmark of democracy.
It is something we should value.
I am looking forward to the debate.
I, myself, am a historian.
It is important to debate this.
The debate will undoubtedly rumble on.
There is still much to be done.
So be it!
It is not a matter for academic study.
(the Member then spoke in Russian)
They are terrible words.
We remember the victims.
Why?
You deceive yourselves.
We are not afraid of you.
This is not very precise.
Nazism and Communism were all around.

The struggle is the same.
Thank you.

Indeed, he will think:
'Round and round it goes,

Round and round it goes.'
And
'Luck has left [him] standing so tall.'
The Irish voters should be respected.
I consider this totally unacceptable.

Every child has a right to education.
Romania is by no means a unique case.
Every child has a right to education.
For example, the EP:
This is hypocrisy at its best ...
This is now common knowledge.
We therefore voted against this report.
I do not think so.
That is ridiculous.
I was pleased to support it.
education
access to religious institutions
matters of marital or family status
It is a bad signal.
The consequences may be dramatic.
Thank you.
I have one reservation, though.
It unreservedly condemns Stalinism.
Of course, difficulties remain.
No update has taken place.
That much I agree with.
In many places it is right.
It is a solid foundation.

I thank you and I await a reply.
It relates to Rule 132.
You cannot simply decide that yourself.
This is the point that we have reached!
(DE) Thank you Mr President.
Thank you very much.
This question remains unanswered.
Sometimes things seem different here.
I only heard the last 10 words.
Thank you very much.
It is yet another own goal.
Our term is also coming to an end.
This item is closed.
I believe this will happen.
There is some discussion on this.
However, let us be realistic.
The result is still far from perfect.
It is, however, full of ideology.
We have seen this again today.
Thank you.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We have a lot of work ahead of us.
(Applause)
I am talking about freedom.
There is no ideal legislation.
That means that we have got it right.
Thank you very much for the work done.
We can be really proud of it.
But there is a huge amount more to do.

That is not the case.

I would like to thank the Commission.
Then something is not going well.
Is this the best instrument available?
The debate is closed.
The next speaker will be Mr Fjellner.
Today, that figure is 155.
So I will do this, 'sans d√©lai'.
Option one: change the Treaty.
We must start now.
It has delivered so far.
I urge these texts to be dropped.
We will continue the discussion.
Rightly so, because it is a disgrace!
We have lost a lot of money.
Just two remarks.
We have to build this Europe on facts.
We need a European model.

I do hope you will consider this again.
I am a co-signatory as well.
We need a commonsense reaction.

The next item is the joint debate on:


Let me now turn to Solvency II.
I now turn to the Weber report.
Ten times, I repeat.
And we should not stop there.
This is not 1937.
What we are missing is leadership.
That is one of the important insights.
That is one insight.
Why was that?
Reaching agreement was no easy task.
They are almost overkill.
Should it be written off?
We believe this to be irresponsible.
Personally, I doubt it.
There is no court of appeal.
There is no concept of caveat emptor.

We need to make progress in this area.
This is an absolutely huge challenge.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is all for now.
This is an estimate that may rise.
We have an ownerless capitalism.
They will be saved by taxpayers.
They therefore grow unreasonably large.
No, we are not!
I call on you to do so.
It is a sound proposal.
Yet it is not enough.
This is regrettable, to my mind.
Did they not have that trillion?
From the sale of 400 tonnes of gold?
I believe that this, too, is important.
There are reasons for this.
There was opposition from the Council.

Can we do more?
Let us hope that we can get that back.
Capital is defined as well.

I therefore voted for this report.
I definitely endorse the report.
This involves significant costs.
I therefore voted for this report.
That is why we voted against.
In 2008, 165 trawlers were scrapped.
The proposal is preposterous.
we support a common immigration policy;


Thank you very much.
in writing.
I therefore voted against.
Thank you, Mr Kallas.




After all, we are a European community.
It will do so in this case as well.
The debate is closed.
Why have we done this?
So why, then, have we done it?
That would be absurd.
Where is Javier Solana?
What is this off-budget account?
Those are not audited.
They have refused to give us papers.
They have refused to give us documents.
We are saying we want to do our duty.
This is beyond question now.
This is not acceptable in a democracy.
It has to stop.
That is not all, however.
The Council must act.
Allow me to give two examples.
What do these EUR 12 million represent?
What do these accounts contain?
We want answers to these questions now!
What happened to these EUR 12 million?
We therefore have no transparency.
This is not democracy.
These people are simply lazing around.
Then there is the use of funds.
Where do the many millions of euro go?
Where does the money go?
This will not work for long.
There is someone to take care of it.
We are not nowadays a fan club.
Definitely not.
We are a Europe of citizens.
We have to be accountable to everyone.
The Council must do the same.
I firmly reject this accusation.
The data can all be documented.
Much attention has been paid...
Ah, the Council has arrived!
Very good.
(Applause)
(Protests)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
The next item is the joint debate on
Thank you.
This, too, helps to ensure road safety.
I have high hopes for this.
I too could not agree more.
It does not work in this case.
Thank you.

That is Mrs ≈¢icƒÉu's report, then.
English respect is destroyed.
Where will it all end?
It is citizen-focused politics.
It is a known quality.
They meet the criteria.
It is also a question of safety.
We should share these best practices.

Thank you, Mr Sterckx.
Then we shall be credible.
The joint debate is closed.
So I think it should be included.
This is a good report.
It is a disaster.
Who has delivered this?
This is urgently needed.
That is the conclusion.

It was evident from all of the debates.
That is what I wished to say.

Subject: EU Alzheimer's strategy

The mandate does not cover SMEs.
It is true that Serbia requested it.
We must be very aware of that.

So what does this data tell us?
But something else is also interesting.
Subject: BONUS-169
Is this happening, or not?
Subject: Communicating with citizens

Online consultation is commonly used.
Could I just ask one more question?
Composition of Parliament: see Minutes
This is truly innovative.
End of the intended declaration.
We need to find something better.
Let this not be the case in Europe.
My problem is: who benefits?
That is out of all proportion.
But I will touch on some of the areas.
She mentioned the matter of contracts.
Ms Lichtenberger made a fine address.
This has been there since the year dot.
That concludes this item.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Action Plan on Urban Mobility (debate)
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you.
Why?

The latter will be useful.
I should like to give an example.
The situation is in fact serious.
Why exactly?
We are not even competent for it.
Our society is constantly ageing.
Let us not waste that time.
Well, this is not what this is about.
There are the URBAN programmes.
That is our proposal.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
The next item is the joint debate on
There is need for this initiative.

Second 'Marco Polo' programme (debate)
What is to happen?
That makes sense.
That makes sense.
It has a budget of EUR 450 million.
There is a problem, though.
This reduction is not enough.
As a result, we achieved a great deal.
Then it will become exciting again.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Thank you.
Thank you.
My thanks to the rapporteur.
Why?
That is what it is about.
I look forward to more work.
We still have things to do.
For the rest, Parliament is sovereign.
Thank you.

That is unacceptable.

I also wish him all the best.
Let us keep this in perspective.
Nor do we want them to be bled dry.
Where are they being most successful?
At the moment, this is left to chance.
This is a positive development.
And if we do not do that, who will?
Patients are in such a weak position.
That must not happen.
A compromise is therefore necessary.
It has to be planned.
We want specific legislation.
We, ourselves, go much further.
Without a large majority?
Thank you for endorsing it.
The ball is now in the Council's court.
Seize it!
Let us not waste this opportunity!
I wish Mr Bowis a speedy recovery.
I will name three of these.
This directive is about choice.
Commissioner, healthcare is not a good.
It puts us back where we started.
These people now have a choice.
It is a proposal worth standing up for.
What manner of people are these?
Health is not a free market.
Why are you doing this?
You are now doing the same thing again.
Is there anything more cowardly?
We all have a choice today.
I know which way I will be voting.





Health cannot be a business.
But let us now be totally frank.
But what happens?
Why?
You have taken up your responsibility.
Europe's role is a coordinating role.
This issue has to be addressed.
We have codified this in Article 8(3).
Unfortunately, this cannot be accepted.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We do not want to lose momentum now.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
This proposal is a disgrace.
Patient safety (debate)
These figures are unacceptably high.
I look forward to hearing your views.
The debate is closed.
Rare diseases (debate)
One point also concerns prevention.
Expertise is therefore rare.
Politics should not exert pressure.
These are all very important.
Many rare diseases are hereditary.
Thank you for your attention.
I shall conclude, Mr President.
The will is there.
I do not think so.
I do not agree with that.

Then we would have one summit less.
Europeans have failed.
As things stand, we cannot.
That is not a recovery plan.
We still have everything to do.
Where does this figure come from?
How can it be justified?
We need to continue in this direction.

The next item is the joint debate on:
I emphasise that it is a reform.
We will hear more about that later.

This package brings numerous advances.
So, thank you very much.




We therefore have cause to celebrate.
It is very important for our industry.
Commission declaration
on universal service (Recital 3a)
That is a good sign.
This is completely unacceptable.
Let me make two points.
No, I think not.
This is absolutely vital.
(The President cut off the speaker)
May I also thank the rapporteurs.
What is our response going to be?
That must be made clear.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(SV) Thank you, Madam President.
I regret that this occurred.
I do not like it.
It smells a bit to me.
We have perfectly good copyright laws.
That should be enough.
I believe we have done something good.
Here too we have had great success.
This is a great help for our citizens.
This is a really important point.
I support them.
I think, in fact I am convinced, ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Everyone can benefit from it.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Improved competition must be central.
I am sorry that I am a bit late.
We need a new model for this.
It is not the French model.
This is very important.
It has been a very constructive debate.
They are important for every consumer.
That is all.
¬∞¬∞¬∞
We will forward the request.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Thank you.
So how can we address this?
However, 1992 is some time ago.
Thank you for the report.
This decision is wise and right.
It is not acceptable!
We must not do this.
There is no sense in it!
It is also not at all necessary.
Come on Commissioner, please!
A to G is easy to understand.
We need decisions based on facts.
Thank you for the debate.

Explanations of vote
Oral explanations of vote
My group and I voted in favour.
We must now, however, follow it up.
I do not know.
It is possible to go further.
We should have gone further today.
We have only made a small step.
We need to do much more.
(LV) Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
(LV) Thank you, Mr President.
It is a missed opportunity.
Written explanations of vote
I voted in favour.
We believe that this is a good thing.
The matter seems obvious.

in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour.
Consequently, I cannot support it.
in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour.
I am working hard!
Europe needs it.
You said you would consult Parliament.
We have no faith in Mr McCreevy's plan.
Mass youth unemployment!
My group follows that logic.
He should sign it forthwith.
These are the challenges of our times.
The unanimous procedure is a mistake.
For this, you are rightly respected.
It is strange.
We are in the worst crisis since 1929.
And what do I hear?
Nothing!
Nothing!
That is why I appeal to you today.

Please do it.
What have the workers gained?
What have the monopolies gained?
Yet official Europe is at a dead end.
This applies especially to Ukraine.
This is a strange discussion.
You must be joking.
What is Europe doing?
This is not what we want.
You have missed the point Mr Barroso.
We will miss him a great deal.
This includes my country, Poland.
And the last matter, Madam President.
We do not want a return to nationalism.
I will not stand for that.
I would urge him to revise his line.
I think we did a good job.
It will be prepared.
Many of you talked about employment.
(Applause)
(Applause)
It is affecting the emerging markets.
That is a mistake.
I myself am a party man.
Hence, I am clearly a party man.
There was no division on this matter.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
The next item is the joint debate on:
They need ideas and projects.
I am hopeful that it will.
It deserves no less.
The EGF is the baby here.
We have found a compromise.
I am very happy about this.
(The President cut off the speaker)
No we cannot.
The Commission wanted a summit.
Is this an unavoidable development?
No, it is not.
I have just one question.
We are not seeing this at the moment.
It is time for consistent action here!
Workers then have no job at all.
How social is that?
All workers have the right to work.
What does a redundant worker want?
I congratulate the rapporteurs.
Social policy involves more!
New social phenomena are appearing.
We cannot wait for it!
At the Romanian level perhaps?
There it is around EUR 72 a month.
(Laughter)
Workers would then benefit even more.
We need good and swift results!
Thank you very much.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Question Time (Commission)
Please confirm that is your view.
What is the difference?
The first question was interconnection.


So we have not excluded it.
Subject: Nuclear power stations
It is not only about savings.
There are many issues involved.
There are plenty of opportunities.
Subject: Internet piracy Canada
Subject: Korea FTA

Thank you very much.
Thank you for having spoken in Italian.
All airports will therefore be checked.
Can you rule this out?
The next item is the joint debate on:
Third countries are producing blends.
This cannot be.
However, I am from Bordeaux.
They all remain silent.
I completely agree with Mrs Laperrouze.
We can see that again here today.
Who is going to pay for all this?
Wine could even be made in Thailand.
What is the definition of wine?
I remember that speech very clearly.
This is an insult to our wine growers.
Let us call a spade a spade.
Watch out on 19 June.
Therefore, we ask for your support.
You met our wine growers.
This is what we are asking you.
This is our suggestion to you.
Do not penalise real wine growers.
Therefore, there is too much ambiguity.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
Commissioner,
Democratic process in Turkey (debate)
Today the mood has changed somewhat.
Hasty comments should be avoided.
That would be really surprising.
The list goes on.
That should be clear to all of us here.
This has gone on for 35 years.
Therefore, let us be consistent.
We have had enough.
The time has now come to use the stick.
If no, why is it no longer concerned?
The jury is still out.
The debate is closed.
Is it possible?
This is contained in Amendment 28.
Now I will get to the point.
What should we do to change this?
My congratulations.
The first of these is money.
The debate is closed.
I will wind up there.
I have two or three quibbles, however.
Thank you, Mrs Frassoni.
The result of a vote must stand.
This is excellent.
This reform is essential.
. - (SV) Thank you, Mr President.
Why?
And quite rightly, too!
We have made it slightly more flexible.
This enables a restricted right.
I mentioned some earlier.
It is not a referral back.
It will be up to the House to decide.
The debate is closed.
I am going to talk about petitions.
You can understand both sides.
You can understand both sides.
It is a compromise.
(Applause)
Firstly, minority languages.
Secondly, admissibility.

Closure of the sitting
Opening of the sitting
(The sitting was opened at 9 a.m.)
The next item is the joint debate on:
The package consists of three parts.
This risk remains high to this day.
This is clearly the case here too.
We expect nothing less!
I will now turn to my subject: energy.
(Applause)
It is very kind of you to mention this.
Normally, they are the blockers.
This really ought to be self-evident.
Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you.
The tool, then, is inadequate.
This work should be our priority.
(Applause)
It is, to some extent, dubious.
Thank you.
In Germany, this affects the milk fund.
That is all well and good.
Thank you.
However, we must be careful.
It is very good.
This is a good sign.
Mr Paparizov mentioned Bulgaria.
There are many factors.

The next item is the joint debate on:
There are five points.
I ask for your support in this.
This needs financial resources.
This is a good signal.
We are not fully satisfied with this.
EFRAG is a European body.
Let me be more precise.
Much recovery is on track.
We should bear that in mind.
Own funds must be defined better.
We welcome this.
It is no coincidence.
I am pleased to have clarified that.
I would like to say the following.
This is a problem.
I doubt that.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.

The work will therefore continue.
The proposal is for a 5% retention.
Five per cent is not significant.
This has been required by the G20.

Written explanations of vote
I voted against.
Unheard of in a democracy!
That is a shame.


That is why we decided to abstain.
Romania supports this project.
in writing. - I congratulate Mr Karas.
This is unacceptable.
That is why we voted against.
Taxpayers' money must be used wisely.
It is important to bear this in mind.
I did not make my oral explanation.
For these reasons we have abstained.
The answer is patently obvious.
Voting time (continued)
We now continue with the vote.
Composition of Parliament: see Minutes
Why was Europe divided?
Why?
That is the problem.
That must be noted.
I am grateful for all your speeches.
Let this be a lesson to us.
The debate is closed.
We will continue to work on this.
These efforts will continue.
This is one of our top priorities.
This dialogue is valuable.
Allow me to give a few examples.
I will now turn to women's rights.
Compromises have been reached.
He is quite right to say so, therefore.
The same holds true for children.
Our policies are compartmentalised.
We have to put a stop to that.
I thank him for mentioning that.
That gives us hope for the future.
Let us take Russia.
The Khodorkovsky case is just symbolic.
It has to be a report for action.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
However, I oppose this amendment.
Let me remind you of two examples.
Secondly, Britain.

(Applause)
Thank you very much.

I will first turn to Mr Popa.
I turn now to the Dublin Regulation.
I will turn now to the support office.
I shall conclude.
This is an extremely dangerous message.
Everyone has to play their part.
Thank you.
We cannot deny that any longer.

Why?
That must be a fundamental condition.
I should like now to thank Parliament.
I insist on this.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
The next item is the joint debate on
The answer is simple.
That is very clear.

Subject: Climate change
We have a job yet to do in Ireland.
Again, thank you.
Many thanks.
Subject: European Employment Pact
Subject: Health care abroad
(Applause)
We are very pleased with this outcome.
That is not true of everyone, though.
We know why it happened.
(Applause)
This framework is becoming restrictive.
In my report, the number 7 is proposed.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
I think that is quite something.
Still, this is not enough.
It is a rum old world.
(Applause)
(Applause)
It is part of the process.
I find the idea very good.
You have our full support.
I thank you all.
We promise to continue their work.
It is important to remember that.
I find that really good.
Thank you, Mr Dehaene.
It is also a reformist treaty.
That was not the agreement.
We have come a long way.
It has been a great honour.
We really do need a major crisis'.
But we have it.
We have this crisis.
And the citizens' initiatives?
Why?
(Heckling)
I believe we should be more militant.
(Heckling)
(Applause)
And that is important.
Conditions have changed fundamentally.
Ireland has decided.
Thank you.
It should be complicated.
So much for democracy!
We are no better on the rule of law.
He is right.
Britain will vote 'no'.
Let me give colleagues due notice.
That is a very high hurdle to reach.
That is the way it is.
I have learnt a great deal!
This treaty gives us new objectives.
Mr President, I welcome this debate.
It would be foolish of us not to do so.
This Union of ours is unique.
It is a unique democratic experiment.
It is not without its faults.
But Europe also needs a new direction.
It is not certain.
There are also lost opportunities.
I hope that is only a technical delay.
It has been a very interesting debate.
You have a choice.
Not all.
Do you know what?
In the end they did what he said.


Why?
Please look around the Chamber.
(PL) Excuse me!
I must protest!

How did the crisis start?
How did the subprime problem start?
I think we can all learn from that.
There is a mechanism for doing that.
Are we also going to agree to that?
Is that our community of values?
We need to walk, not run.
We can work it out together.
The present situation requires this.

As a result, the Council is supporting:
There are great expectations of you.
One thing is clear.
Sweden was one of these countries.
We dared to be part of Europe.
Today that has reversed.

Our planet has a fever.
The effects will be dramatic.
That is the bad news.
So what is the good news?
We must act now, however.
Allow me to give a specific example.
(Applause)
So how do we get there?
The alternatives will not emerge.
That is not enough, however.
It is our task to answer them.
So what can we do?
There are now 27 of us.
Europe has been enriched.
Together we are strong.
We talk of membership 'negotiations'.
We will act as an 'honest broker'.

It will, unfortunately, get even worse.
This is what we are calling for.
You have a lot on your plate.
Prime Minister, a few important points.

It can count on our support.

My group rejects such strategies.
Iran is a sovereign state.

It is time for tangible action.
This regime has blood on its hands.
What a difference!
It is to this that we owe loyalty.
What does this mean?
We must not send out the wrong message.

What is your position on this?
How is it currently being dealt with?
The first one is fairly obvious.

China (debate)



I wanted to mention this first.
They pose no direct terrorist threat.




No.
I do not think so.
I do not think so.
We respect the Chinese system.
However, that does not mean ...
(Interruption by Mr Posselt)
We respect China's unified system.
It must be the other way round.
That is not the approach that we need.
This is deplorable.
We must condemn it.
We live in a small world.
We must live together.
The EU is a clear example of this.
That is the road to chaos and conflict.
Are we on the side of China or Tibet?
Where do we stand then?
That is the question.
It is obvious to me whose side I am on.
He spoke of separatism.
(Heckling)
Ethnic violence is always evil.
They are not there yet.

What is the truth?
What has happened to these farmers?
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is unacceptable.
Libya supplied weapons to the IRA.
For this they must be held accountable.
This is our common objective.
Thank you, Mr Batten.
(ET) Banking requires supervision.
Four months later: nothing.
Agreement was reached.
The Commission has been attentive.
I will come back to this later on.
The sales figures are catastrophic.
According to my information ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
You will have an extra 30 seconds.
It must not be obstructed.
That is, ultimately, the question.
What is it that we are discussing?
Let us make it real!
Grab the ball!
It must not fail on trivialities.
It was not self-evident.
It contained nothing new.
That was my first point.
US car makers are a case in point.
I say this entirely without irony.
It is not yet too late.
I am very pleased, in fact!
It is not - it is a European issue!
The Opel deal is a sham.
That is becoming ever more obvious.

I think he is right about that.
I can only refute this definitively.
Unfortunately, I disagree.
Yet why did you not do more?
Demand cannot keep up with supply.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Training will be hugely important.
I am pleased that the rescue succeeded.
Things have got out of control.
We need the facts and figures.
We are objective.
The debate is closed.
We owe it to our children.
It worked well this summer.
I presented this report on 9 May 2006.
I am thinking of the tsunami.
I believe that we must go further.
Even so, we still have fires.
(The President cut off the speaker)
There should be no recurring disasters.
Subsequently, we set up a fund.
Two points must be developed.
Firstly, responsiveness.
And then, there is prevention.
That is a criminal act.
(Applause)
We have here a good resolution.
Is that still on the agenda?
What is actually happening?
Two thoughts struck me.
Look at prevention.
Mobilisation is therefore immediate.

The debate is closed.

Thank you for your answer.
I trust that common sense will prevail.
So I will try and address the concerns.
Yes, I do.
Korea is a serious market.

Written statements (Rule 149)
That is not our job.
This shows just how much is at stake.
That does not bother me, however.
Moreover, it is irresponsible.
I call on us all to act together!
It is their responsibility.
I would even say, to the contrary.

I do not grasp that.

There is no alternative.

That is all as regards asylum.
I now come to the third theme.

There you have it.
Allow me to give an example.
We had called for an investigation.
This is international maritime law.
That is necessary and right.
This is pointless.
It is money down the drain.
Let there be an end to it then.
We shall be doing so, in any case.





The devil is in the detail.
It is important that you restated it.
This is not true.
Such disarray is unacceptable.
We need some obligation here.
(PL) We want to fight immigration.
It is a great problem.
Is this really advisable?
No, they should not have to do so.
They cannot hide from this any longer.
They also include Turkey.
Why do they not do so?
What can we do?

This is unacceptable.

When do you expect to conclude it?
Turkey's conduct is provocative.
The problem is very acute.
Today or tomorrow ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

The old and new Europe are no more.
This is our Europe!
We want it to be modern and strong.

(Applause)
We must meet those challenges.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
We are facing an energy crisis.

This is what our citizens expect of us.
So what are the most important goals?
(Applause)
But we must go further down that road.

I take great satisfaction in this.
It is, above all, about human rights.
(Loud applause)

Because this is our Europe.
A modern Europe.
A strong Europe.

Mr President, we wish you luck!
(Applause)
Thank you very much for your speech.
What is needed is that good will.
(Applause)
These are democracy and transparency.
We talk about democracy.
(Applause)

Equal rights are the key issue.
We sincerely thank you for this offer.
I wish you every success with this too.
It is not a Slovak-Hungarian dispute.
I am pleased that you mentioned it.
Why am I mentioning this?
Absolute terror reigned in the country.
That may be so.
I feel the same.
This is really what it was about.
We will work out an agreement.
I concur entirely.
(Applause)
I have already been to Sweden.
Let us remember this.
I like his offer very much.
Mr Siwiec mentioned Ukraine.
We will endeavour to achieve this.
I wanted to stress this very strongly.
This is extremely important for us.
You spoke very wisely.
I agree.
Thank you for your remarks.
It is true.
May God be praised.

They ran riot again on 23 October.
There were indeed problems.
From now on, think before you speak!
It is also a crisis of values.
For me, the choice is clear.
We have experience.
We have this unique experience.
We must have an agenda for change.
I received many points of view.
Solidarity must remain key.
It has clearly proved unsustainable.
But why stop there?
Why only defend the internal market?
We need solidarity.
(Sustained applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
What a risk for you, Mr Barroso!
(Applause)
We need more!
We need social impact assessments.
This strategy must finally be stopped.
You have failed to say it again today.
However, I expect you to say it once.
This is what we will judge you on.
(Applause)
There is a way to get there.
(Applause)
(Heckling)
He has been here for a while?
It is not very responsible ...
(Applause)

Wait for what?
They are there.
So be it.
Then, I hear what Mr Daul has to say.
You are going to get a roasting!
Jos√© Manuel Obama: Yes, he can!
No, but stop, stop, Mr Barroso!
We know what you are like!
The banks: why did they go crazy?
Why?
You talked about the Lisbon process.
You talked about research.
Mr Barroso, explain something to me.
Deregulation.
Not at all, not at all, Mr Barroso.
(Applause)
Why change the rules of the game?
But things went wrong, did they not?
And what about your record?
We will see.
Yes, he is very happy to go!
You did nothing.
Why not?
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is very important.
These are national decisions.
You have an obsession with me.
I do not have an obsession with you.
(Applause)
This is important.
You have even made T-shirts.
Listen!
I myself heard your proposals.
It is up to you to vote for me.
I am offering you loyal cooperation.
That is a shame!
(Applause)
(Mr Cohn-Bendit held up a blue card)
Who among us never makes mistakes?
We are all in the same boat.
All of us are jointly responsible.
How will we restructure the Commission?
What about the diplomatic service?
What about protecting the climate?
We are not quite sure what that means.
Three broad points on your guidelines:
That simply will not work.
Laval did not happen yesterday.
Why Mr Barroso?
This is why we also need to vote now.
Why Mr Barroso?
We want him to have genuine authority.
(Applause)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Others want to postpone the decision.
The world is not waiting for us.








Thank you for listening.
Thank you.
What would the citizens do?
I believe that is very, very little.
I want to make that quite clear.
Let us be frank.
That is not acceptable.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Apologies for cutting you off.
On the contrary, I recognise them.
I made that proposal.
So I completely disagree.
You are missing the target.
I am committed to social cohesion.
That is your choice, not mine.
I am committed to that.
Are you? That is my question.
(The President cut off the speaker)
It is a political issue.
The situation is clear.
You were minister from 2002 to 2004.
We grew up in peace.
We grew up in a welfare state.
But history is knocking on our door.
I count on your leadership.
Why do you not use plain language?
We need a leadership that listens.
You need to do more in this regard.
You need to do more in this regard.
Preserve us from that fate!
Europe has had enough of lame ducks.
Please God.
Are you that leader, Mr Barroso?
Will you meet the challenge?
Because you have not convinced me yet.
(Applause)
Many I agree with.
For this commitment I thank you.
We need strong institutions.
Our view remains strongly negative.
That is not enough.
You thrive when challenged.
I would like to highlight one point.
Good luck tomorrow.
(Applause)

(PL) Madam President, Europe is united.
However, Europe is also diversified.
I wish you every success.
These guarantees are important to us.
These warnings were definitely made.
It is as simple as that.
I went there for a democratic debate.
I like democratic debate.
Let us be clear on that.
I believe that.
What are the Chinese doing?
Immediately after, we reacted.
We reacted with concrete proposals.
That is the European position.
They are on the table.
That, once again, is what makes Europe.
Someone spoke of Guant√°namo.
Thank you, anyway.
That is obvious.
That would cause divisions.
I do not see what the point would be.
Let us be clear on that.
You are the only candidate.
Is that democratic?'
I lose to an ideal candidate.
That is the reason.
Europe is very diverse.
I can assure you of that.
Some of them are still here.
I am grateful to you.
Your support is not a blank cheque.
I think highly of Parliament.

All that is already in hand.
You must therefore be bold.
Be bold!
We cannot get out of this on our own.
I have several concerns.
I quote from that.
We know that this will not work.
Wake up, Europe!
Today we are talking about the G20.
It is a good process.
The de Larosi√®re report is too little.
The political will must not fail us.
Very well.
A great deal has happened.
The citizens are unsettled.
These are the people's real needs.
Guiding principles must be affirmed.
The crisis is not over.
There is not one word on Europe.
You must speak louder than them.
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner.
For this we need a consistent approach.
Firstly, we need more Europe.
Secondly, we need more State.
Finally, we need a better market.
I believe this is essential.
We cannot be the only virtuous ones.
What is your position on this?
What is the Council's position?
Our economies are still very fragile.

Finally, let me deal with transparency.
That is real transparency.
Which expert, though?
The debate is closed.
(Vote: 17 September 2009)
So what are the next steps?
I would like to make three points.
You have our full support here.
However, some questions do still arise.
That would be very important to us.
I do not think so.
No, this is wrong.
Let us hope that this one works well.
The second problem is overfishing.
That is the least we must do.
How will safety at sea be addressed?
(The President cut off the speaker)
It will be what we make it.
First, the shape.
Finally, the last issue is financing.

Developments are often very worrying.
That is positive.

It is not in their interests.
That is humiliating.
Please God.
That is not enough for us.
Why should they?
Albania will manage.
You have our support.
It is a very clear political matter.
The conditions must be met.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Will the Commission do it?
Will the Council?
Thank you very much.
I can understand that.
They have not been forgotten, however.
That is what we are doing today.
I hope you will help us to take it.
I would like to stress that point.
It is important, this Europe of values.
Thus, we are helping them technically.
That is what we want.
I am personally very committed to this.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The next item is the debate on:
It is about European values.
We cannot tolerate discrimination.
We are all Europeans.
What does that actually mean?
What are we going to do next?
And why?
That is a vile misrepresentation.

(Interjection from the floor)
OK, that is the case for you.

What are we talking about today?
We have worked for this for many years.
It does have a purpose.

We have ensured training for handlers.
We are gathering scientific evidence.
This is what I can say at the moment.
Subject: Child trafficking in the EU
Thank you very much, Minister.
Why is that?
Madam President, thank you, Mrs Hedh.
That is why they coincide.
It is indeed unfortunate.
Thank you very much for that reply.
We have the wherewithal there.
We really must act on it.
I do appreciate the detailed response.
We have done that.
Subject: Stability and Development Pact
I have just one other query.
Subject: Information about Chechnya
(DE) Thank you, Mrs Malmstr√∂m.
Thank you.
Subject: EU policy in Burma
To mention some of these actions:
I am sorry.
Subject: Closer EU-US relations
The US has a key role to play here.
Thank you very much Minister.
The EU stands united.
We know what we want.
But it will take time.
We are very process-oriented.
But it is on the agenda.

The dairy sector is in trouble.

We are all agreed on that.
Its experts got it very wrong.
Times have changed.
A laisser-faire policy is unacceptable.
They have to be controlled.
I consider it necessary.
There is no other solution.
(ES) ¬°Bon dia!
I am concerned by those comments.
I cannot see where the link is.
What could European producers do?
(The President cut off the speaker)
It is a short-term, knee-jerk reaction.
Perhaps you should do so now.
We must find common solutions.
They receive only 19 cents per litre.
The crisis has not eased.
We have to be careful.
This must be corrected.
They need strict quotas.
This has to change.
This problem has to be resolved.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
That must be very clear.
That is I think the right policy.

First of all, Nabucco.
We made a major breakthrough this July.
Where are the difficulties?
The philosophies are different.
We have launched a call for proposals.
It really is the biggest element.
CCS is usually needed for two reasons.
So, diversification also covers supply.
You also talked about Desertec.
This has to stop.
(The President cut off the speaker)
What is Desertec all about?
This is also an important task for us.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Well, it should be, and it must be.
Azerbaijan promises everyone gas.
Companies must be encouraged.
We just have to look at the map.



Many of you have spoken about Russia.
Much depends on relations with Turkey.
Thank you for your attention.

I am talking about the Arctic region.
It is not in Europe's interests.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I have a question for the Commission.

All technologies must be considered.
It is not a quick fix.
This is good news.

Kazakhstan is an important country.
This is actually a very difficult case.

I am very sorry about that.

It was decided democratically.

Another point is comitology.
(Heckling)
China has 1.3 billion inhabitants.
India has 1.1 billion.
There are two options open to us.
We need to ask Mr Klaus a question.
That is the crucial question.
We have to thank Brian Cowen.
So I am happy.
What do we do in the meantime?
That was your argument.
So you react depending on your mood.
That is life; that is how it is.
That is not a public democratic debate.
Put your proposals on the table.
I have one thing to say to you.
It all depends on the Czechs.
We should all reflect on that.
Now they have the result they wanted.
We must combat wage dumping.
That is politically absurd!
The whole thing was a travesty!
(Heckling)
Oh, so you respect this vote, do you?
The whole thing was an outrage.
That was what it was all about.
I suspect that it is all over.
(Mixed reactions)
What is the point of any of it?
That is good.
Ireland has not ratified.
(Applause)
We have to respect the institutions.
There is indeed unity in diversity.
I repeat: unity in diversity.
And I mean all of them.
Please could you answer this?
I accept that.
It was not.
I find this regrettable.
Ireland is a democratic state.
It is an independent democratic state.
That is not democracy.
He thinks it is we parliamentarians.
If not, we will not be taken seriously.
That is absolutely clear.
That is my, and our, opinion.
You must be aware of that.
Today, however, it was not amusing.
Is there enough democracy in Europe?
Is the democracy in Europe perfect?
That simply did not work.
We cannot pressurise our Member States.
That is a positive thing!
European solidarity is a good thing.
The treaty opens up new opportunities.
We must speak with one voice.
All falsehoods.
What is your answer to that?
Under no circumstances can he be -
(The President cut off the speaker)
I can see a blue card.
It was won by foul means, was it not?
I became a Catholic in Ireland.
It is not about that.
What happened and why?
I maintain that it was fear.
Thank you very much.
We have certainly lost time.
We have lost years.

Mr President, the decision is made.
I wish to say no more about it.
Therefore, many voters stayed at home.
EU democracy is a one-way street.
There was no fair campaign.
The voters were intimidated.
That is not possible.
Ireland should be thanked for this.
What has changed?
The text?
Very little.
The context?
A lot.
That is what matters.
Allow me to make an observation.
Why might this be?
The Czech case is a different one.
It did not happen.
It will never happen.
Thank you for your attention.
We can never take them for granted.

There were perhaps four key factors.
The Irish people responded.
That would be totally unacceptable.
Will Europe be ready to do so?
It is still hard to say.
We should prepare for the future.
Europe is our home.
This treaty has come a very long way.
What can this be attributed to?
But who in here really cares?
Well, I do.
It is quite likely to be Tony Blair.
God save our Queen!
Please help save Romania.
Well yes, it is.
It is very democratic.
There will be.
We need to do that.
Could I just start with some facts.
And why did they do that?
And this is what was done.
Why do we have to explain?
So they looked at the reasons.
I was there myself.
What kind of statements are these?
Should I believe in them?
This is what happened.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)

We have not been alone.
This is not true.
France has not humiliated Africans.
Let us hope that it will be effective.

Could you tell us more about this?
We have stuck to this all year.
They related to the previous regime.
Thank you very much, Mrs Malmstr√∂m.
The debate is closed.
Many others are at risk of closing.

Welcome to Absurdistan!
This gives a ratio of 300 to 1.
This is extremely urgent.
He needs immediate medical attention.
None of this is true.
This is no coincidence.
It has instilled fear in people.
Parliament has a medical service.
I regard them as the biggest minority.
Minorities are entitled to feel safe.


That concludes the item.

No.
This is why we have elections.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you very much for your question.
It is my decision.
Please behave properly.
(Applause)
Mr Napolitano is right.
Why do I say that?
How?
I completely disagree.
I protest.

That cannot be true.
This is one of the Copenhagen criteria.
(Applause)
That is fundamental to democracy.
(Applause)
We are all educated people.
Let us get something going.
(Applause)
I am talking about double standards.

This is a highly dangerous development.
Where is this directive?
Mrs Reding, what are you afraid of?
What forces are at work here?
So, who controls it?
Simply lost.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(Applause)
I, too, am not an Italian speaker.
(The President called for order)
That is an interesting question.
That is my opinion.
It would make the debate overrun.
I am sorry.
The Soviet Union of journalists.
What fine freedom fighters!
Shame on you, cowards!
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is not the problem, however.
However, this is not the issue here.
The answer to that is clear.
It certainly is.
It certainly is important.
Italy's concerns are also our own.
One of these is the United Kingdom.
(BG) Thank you, Madam President.

These questions must be fully explored.
The debate is closed.
So that is the first response.
His colleagues voted against that ban.
We need to face up to these challenges.

Much remains to be done, however.

The Commission is right to worry.
I hope you are proud of yourself.
And when we fight back, we win.
This, too, is Schengen.
I would like to evaluate this.
I very much regret this.
I now come to Parliament.
There is a misunderstanding here too.
This was no surprise to me.
All parties must be involved.

I come firstly to SIS II.
Thank you again for coming here.
The new system is still not working.

The Commission talks of restructuring.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We need to get everyone on board.
We have to combine our efforts.
Expectations are very high.
Second, offers in terms of financing.
Enough has been said about the crisis.
Go forward positively!
So, what are we calling for?


For what are we going to do with them?
We all know that it does no such thing.
I urge you to make the right choice.
No further time can be wasted.
We created it ourselves.
These two themes are intimately linked.
It is time to look at the facts.
The EU has a vital responsibility.
This is not simply a competition.
You can count on our support.
The Bali Action Plan put that well.
We consider this an essential area.
Without success.
This is, indeed, a key matter.
Inaction is a crime against humanity.
That is totally unacceptable.
A pollutant!
It is a life-giving natural gas.
Isn't this all about political control?
Now let us consider the hypotheses.
It was almost a carbon copy speech.
We heard something about polling.
That is 81%.
Why?
This is unjust and ineffective.
This is the fairer option.
(Applause)
Europe must help this come about.
I do still have one specific concern.
Have you ever played Russian roulette?
This must not just be a wish list.
Presidency, it is good to see you here.
There are no trees.
Climate change kills.
It is as simple as that.
That is EUR 30 billion per annum.
I hope that we all agree on that.
I have one final word to add.
That will not be enough, however.

What we do must be wise and effective.
Science is not a totem.
These are key points.
I agree with Mr Carlgren.
I think the answer to this is obvious.
These are very complex issues.
I have no doubt about that.
They have to come forward.

Free questions
Let us be realistic about it.
There either are or there are not.
Mr Verhofstadt, let us be clear.
These are the three stumbling blocks.
I have good news for all of you.
Is that your idea of a social Europe?
So you have almost got your Treaty.
Was this agreed all along?
(Applause)
If there were, I would already know.
You chose not to.
That is precisely the logic of it.
(Applause)
If not, I have been misinformed.
So we have a system of human rights.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
I would also like to thank Mr Barroso.
So thank you very much, everyone.
We are linking those two issues.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is 16% of all new jobs.
What are your proposals?
This is very important.
This is a good example.
What happened to them?
That is a very specific question.
(Applause)
Let us see how it works in practice.

I really enjoyed it.
I think it is a good exercise.
Anyway, you decide the format.

That concludes the item.

Section IV - Court of Justice
Section V - Court of Auditors
Section VII - Committee of the Regions
Section VIII - European Ombudsman
(C7-0128/2009 -.
Is it able to protect the EU's borders?
We have a common pot of funding.
Major issues remain.
It wants financing for administration!
You see, it is the same every time.
Why are you cutting back on that?
We also want to redistribute money.
It is a business-as-usual budget.
What we really need is courage!
(FR) We are Europe.
It has been a good debate.
Many good suggestions have been made.
That is not something we can ignore.
Our goal is excellence in lawmaking.
We are prepared to fight for this.
It is an important contribution.
I am going to mention two of them.
This is a disgrace.
The second matter is the Dairy Fund.
We played our part in attaining that.
Thank you very much, Mrs Gr√§√üle.
I think Members should resist all this.
My time has run out.
Written statements (Rule 149)
It also needs more resources.
That is undisputed.
We are not starting from scratch.
We have already achieved a great deal.
We can do more.
We can do better.
How can we do this?
We must be humble, however.
I want to make myself clear.
Naturally, this is a sensitive issue.
Where are we now?
This is a thankless, difficult role.
No.
Can there be freedom without rights?
Of course not.
No.
It means supporting a civilian surge.
We are working intensively on this.
Perhaps we can find other ways.
Shortcomings exist.
Democracy is a universal value.
Question Time (Commission)
Part one
There is no doubt at all about this.
Part two
Could you also support nurseries?
Thank you for the additional questions.
This is the general picture.
That is the feeling.
I want a specific answer.
OLAF has a clear strategy.


Thank you for your words.
What should be the priorities?
Where should we place our emphasis?
Subject: Volunteerism in Sport
Subject: White Paper on sport
Here is an example from Italy.
That is positive discrimination.
That concludes Question Time.
Is that why you require the powers?
I think that is the challenge.
Have we learnt any lesson from it?
What does this mean exactly?
Perhaps it will not be dairy next time.
I stand by that view.
So what do you mean by restructuring?
We demand common, European solutions.
I therefore reject this amendment.
I therefore reject this amendment.
At present, there are two approaches.
I firmly believe this.
Commissioner, support the dairy fund!
I was very pleased about it.
That is most important.
Let us look at the lessons.
This is the wrong approach.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I am sure that is not what we want.
Nothing could be more wrong.
This was one part of the discussion.
So it is not a blank cheque.
So it is not restructuring.
How should it be distributed?
It is actually necessary.
It was quite smart, I would say.
(Applause)
That concludes this item.
The vote will take place on Thursday.

(Applause)
That would be much more appropriate.
That is not true.
(Protests)

I certainly would.
So please appoint Tony Blair.

So, what do we do in this case?
There are also positive aspects.
(Applause)

So much the better!

If we do not do this, no one else will.
It is not a bazaar.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
From that, there will be consequences.
These are not new subjects.
I agree.
That is absurd.
We need to have extra finance.
Who will represent the EU now?
There is certain to be chaos.
That cannot be allowed to happen!
That is democratic legitimacy.
So let us deal with the real world.
We want a citizens' Europe.
This is what I believe we are lacking.
What are we going to do?
The deadline is 1 November.
What action are we going to take?

The damage is not inconsiderable.
First point: the economic crisis.
Trust is good, control is even better.
Second point: climate change.
Third point: immigration.


That is what we are here to do.
That is very soon.
It may, therefore, take some time.

We will learn together.
But we need to look further.
For this, training is essential.
These are matters for the future.
Please forgive me, Mr President.
It is a very important topic.
This proposal is uncosted.
The GUE/NGL group is opposed to this.
It is never ever based on demos.
Not, I think, the Council.
That has to act unanimously.
What about the Parliament?
No, that is limited to consultation.
My speaking time has run out.
I digress.
I am absolutely delighted about this.
But how will that role develop?
Where will its limits be?
They are creating a new Yugoslavia.
It is not pretty.
My response is a clear 'No'.
This must not happen!
Really interesting.
To deny that would be naive.
What is the reason for this position?
It is a two-way process.
That is sui generis.
One Europe, one voice!
People outside Europe expect this.
Let us make sure that it works.
What will happen to these ministries?
Will they dissolve?
That seems unlikely.
We ought to draw on this experience.
Thank you for your question.
This is outrageous!
We do not agree with this.
Do you believe it is a state?

This is extremely important.

That is a good thing.
I am quite convinced of that.

Three quick points.
It is actually a major opener.
The study was paid for by Parliament.
Peace in the Middle East?
Peace in Afghanistan?
It ought to be developed.
The second area is security.
Europe must hold its own in this.

Subject: The EU's alcohol strategy
Thank you, Mrs Hedh.
We will monitor progress.
I am very pleased about this.
The main cause is alcohol.
Would Sweden like to initiate this?
There might be.
I can understand this.
The reasons for this are clear.
Is the Council aware of this incident?
What are its comments?
That is very positive.
I do apologise.

Let me point out the highlights.
Let there be no illusions.
The year 2020 is only 10 years away.
It is up to us to change this trend.
It still is.
Now to the question of names.
We all know these are difficult issues.
The same is true of others, like China.
We need to rekindle this flame.
We need to have the spirit of 1989.
My thanks to Mr Reinfeldt.
The two are linked.
You mentioned the High Representative.
This is absolutely necessary.
This causes me serious concern.
That is what we have been trying to do.
We are now EU-27.
We have many examples of that.
That is the tough thing with this.
Is that what we want?
I do not think so.
In my view, this is an anticlimax.
I think this is worrying.
I think that is absolutely right.
To Mr Reinfeldt I would like to say:
Welcome
That is not the spirit of the treaty.
We should applaud it.
We should be happy about it.
A treaty, however, is not enough.
What do we need?
In fact, we need more effective tools.
An excellent job has been done.
Listen carefully.
We are the closest to our electorate.
We are directly elected.
You know what I am referring to here.
We can do both.
Well done on what you have done so far.
I am delighted about that.
(Applause)
It is difficult, but it is his goal.
I also read the papers.
I deplore it, but it is a fact.
Europe is still in the lead.
We will keep on being in the lead.
We have the highest ambitions, so far.
We are ready to play our part.

There is no time to be lame ducks.
It is time for women!
Of course we do.
The situation is definitely not ideal.
I must mention two additional facts.
It is indeed right to do so.
The final matter concerns security.
I have two brief points to make.
This is why Russia attacked Georgia.
Should this really be rewarded?
Yet it does not stop there.
China commits genocide in Tibet.
Turkey denies its Armenian holocaust.
I have no time for that kind of talk.
Russia is an important neighbour.
That would be a positive thing.
This is, so to say, the general line.

The next item is the debate on
This is a very wide-ranging directive.
It has many new features.
It is complicated in many areas.
It has needed a lot of attention.
This has to be done consistently.
Otherwise, those barriers will remain.
We want to see that list.
That is not good enough.
What are the biggest challenges, then?
This dialogue has been a key element.
This was already mentioned.
So where do things stand today?
And will Member States deliver?
Some Member States might be late.
Some are still working on it.
I would like to come to my last point.
Anything else would not be sufficient.
Will they have language skills?
We very much doubt it.
Are there any new ideas on this matter?
Why?
Which ones are they?
There is still time.
There might be some delays.
The Services Directive is important.
So we have been very active on that.
I would like to say that very clearly.
That concludes the item.

I fear that is not what is happening.
But that is not what we are getting.
We are fully in agreement with them.
That is the problem.
We do not have that ability.
That is the situation.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
What has happened, though?
That hope is now dead.
The GSP+ agreements must be suspended.
They were not democratic elections.
I am sure that we want this to happen.
As I said, this is a poor country.

This is what we are asking for.

It is not about any link to anything.
It is about the level playing field.
It did not find favour.

Many thanks to your team.
Congratulations Mr Diamandouros.
The service is improving year on year.
A job well done.
The first problem is information.
The facts are relatively clear.
The second problem is costs.
In my opinion, that is excessive.
The third problem is subsidiarity.
I deeply appreciate this.
That is certainly the case.
There are two points here.
The debate is closed.

The EU has remained silent.
That is a very long time.
This will take time.

Listen to Aminatou!
Save her life!
I think we must be very clear today.
The Czech case was another example.
Let me give you just a few examples.
He died on the way to Catania.
There is no unified approach in Europe.
Some of them gave their lives.
Let us revere and honour them.
Agenda
(Parliament accepted the proposal)
It is a negative development.
And what did I read?
I do not think so.
That is the appeal, Mr President.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Let me now move to another issue.
Two things need to happen.
Are these reports true?
(Applause)
It is not perfect.
This is all part of the same issue.
An important decision has been made.
Thank you very much.
This is a chance we should take.
The road ahead is open.
That, however, is not enough.
That is all very important.
We have started to write history.
Well done!
Second, the question of cookies.
That is the way I see things.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
We want a strong Europol.
That is all for the moment.
This is a very serious matter.
Unfortunately, this has not happened.
The Commission is aware of these.
That is the reality: we have a problem.
That is all, nothing further.
We therefore all agree on that point.
Such is the case in Spain.
Thank you, Mr Vice-President.
Of course!
I just want to make a couple of points.
I agree totally with Sophia in 't Veld.
That is the reality as far as I see it.
This is not reasonable.
This proposal was not presented.

Written statements (Rule 149)
My view is that we absolutely should.
That is critical for our credibility.
(Applause)
We must find flexible solutions.
I think it is a misunderstanding.
Everything could be discussed.
What is it that you are doing here?
To what am I referring?
I am referring to Article 192(1).
This interpretation no longer stands.
I wrote a letter to you.
Please read my letter again.
This is a two-tier Parliament.
Thank you.
Let me quote just one example.
Let me explain what I mean.
The debate is closed.
Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes
Closure of the sitting
Opening of the sitting
Now it is time for an agreement.
This has also happened.
I look forward to the dialogue.
However, we face major challenges.
The clock is ticking.
We are your allies.
(Applause)
Someone asked about the practical side.
The EU has shown the way here.
Some people are saying 'go 10% further.
That is a disaster.
Nor do I want it to deliver it.
That is my appeal.
You can see it with the naked eye.
Per day!
It is not a faith.
We are delighted with this.
The question is: is it enough?
The situation is fluid.
Are we strengthening this?
The science is clear.
This is essential for our climate.
I should like to give an example.
What should we do, then?
This House needs a reality check.
She is alive (remember that one!)
She took a shower.
She drove her car to work.
She had her laptop on the whole day.
Everyone does not agree.
There is no room for doubt there.
Mr Florenz mentioned Borneo.
However, he is still very much alone.
That is unacceptable.
Let their journeys not be in vain.
It is an absolute disgrace.
This should be our guide at all times.
We will see you in Copenhagen.
Let us aim for this.
An agreement is a good thing.
We must take this into account.
What a giveaway that was!
This is just enviro-imperialism.
What can we shrewdly achieve?
We need to also take that into account.
We have done a great deal in Europe.
It is not enough.
We need action on a global scale.
(The President cut off the speaker)
First of all, Kyoto was a failure.
We need to go further than that.
Rail transport has been mentioned.
He has been indefatigable.

Biofuels are not a clean alternative.

The point about funding is simple.
This is the time it must be done.
This is a key part of our concern.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We should also set an example.
That is sometimes called into question.
The world has waited long enough.
And yet, I have heard even that today.
The debate is now closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
The climate is changing.
The wave of migration is growing.

When did we ever vote for this?
Written explanations of vote
It is, however, better than nothing.
A conviction was not made.
A conviction was not made.
A conviction was not made.
Free questions
What more can be done?
Thank you for your question, Mr Schulz.
I sympathise with that position.
We all have demands made of us.
You are quite right.
I would very much like to achieve that.
This is the first thing.
That is the second thing.
There is no problem about that.
We cannot act on suppositions.
I would add a further question to this.
I know she will do a fantastic job.
We all know that this in an innovation.
Now for my question to Mr Barroso.
We are at a preparatory work stage.
Only today.
I share your concern on this issue.
You will therefore have more time.
I myself am ready to make a commitment.
How would you defend this decision?
Mr Portas, thank you for your question.
So far, that position has not existed.
That is a competence of the Commission.
We have to look at this.
We have promised it to Parliament.
My first question is as follows.
Is it prepared to be more flexible?
Frontex takes care of this.
Symbols and tears are no longer enough.
(Applause)
There are no simple solutions.
Thank you very much for your attention.
You emphasise child protection.
This hinges on training.
We share your view on this point too.
Thank you, Parliament.
They are making demands of us.
They want answers from us.
'What seems to be the problem, Madam?'
Find me another seat!'
Now, what has this got to do with us?
Do we consider others inferior?

This is where Stockholm fails.
We need to move from words to deeds.

One example is the immigration policy.
How are we going to get there?
Why not?
Think of Guant√°namo.
Europe is the fatherland of rights.
That is the citizen's Europe.
Mobility is now a right.
Thank you, Zita.
They are the future.
What are we doing to protect them?
Let us give it a chance.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We find that balance a bit misleading.
What do you mean by that?
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Allow me to comment on two areas.
The first one is the question of form.
I believe that this is important.
Many people mentioned subsidiarity.
We must retain the benefits of this.
Mr Billstr√∂m has covered this.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
However, a ban does not go far enough.



So what can we do?
They are obliged to do so.
Questions have already been asked.
Is Afghanistan a safe country?
There are limits!
And what are those limits?
Let us stop playing with words.

Why are the people here illegally?
It is very, very difficult.
What I want to do firstly is respond.
I wish to thank the Swedish Presidency.
And we have some problems.
That is what I wished to say.
That concludes the item.
Rapporteur: S√∏ren Bo S√∏ndergaard
Thank you, Mr President.
Why?
In reality, this was nothing new.
The ball is now in the Council's court.
This will be the case in future, too.
(Applause)
No, not this time.
We have made interesting beginnings.
This represents a breakthrough.
Four reasons were cited for this.
Can you tell me that?
No, you cannot.
There is still a very long way to go.
We must change this state of affairs.
Progress has been made in these areas.
(Applause)
Thank you very much for this debate.
That was the position we started from.
We have come a step closer, however.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
That would be completely absurd.
Question Time (Commission)
Self-regulation is not sufficient.

Subject: Food labelling for consumers
What will happen then?
It is about the origin of the product.
We are talking now about health claims.
Subject: Varying consumer rights
We have a network of such authorities.
Subject: Car rental companies
I personally receive many of them.
I think this is a major problem.
I had to return it full again.
That is straightforward best practice.
Subject: Tourism under Lisbon

Thank you for that remark, Mr Posselt.
The next item is a joint debate on
What conclusion can be reached?

That is the principle issue.

This will be very welcome.
We therefore support this report.
There are two caveats I would add.
Thank you very much indeed.
Firstly, I am glad that it exists.
The answer is 'no'!

That is simply not true.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The deal was sealed in December 2008.
The first factor is time.
Therefore, we do not have much time.

But it is not just light bulbs.
They must be about providing security.

If so, how long will it take?
The debate is closed.
Hence this oral question.


I will now start to conclude.
Are there adequate controls?
Why not?
It must be given absolute priority.
This state of affairs cannot go on.
The money is available.
That is not enough, however.
There is always a need for more profit.

We have gone down the wrong road here.
It is the opposite route.
I am therefore in full agreement.

The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
I thank him for making this point.
Mr President, just a final word.
That must be our concern.
Together, we have a range of problems.
Why?
Those were two good reasons.
Does it matter?
Is a minority of value then?
Is a minority language of value?
What is this agenda item dealing with?
This is totally unacceptable.
We cannot have double standards.
(The speaker spoke in Welsh)
(HU) Thank you for the floor.
So, what about Hungarians?
The language law creates an imbalance.
(HU) B√©kess√©g Istent≈ël!
Pace vou«é!
Bo≈æ√≠ pokoj s Vami!
Peace to you from God!
There are problems with a certain law.
I say this in all seriousness.

We have no barriers.
The debate is closed.

Opening of the sitting
Documents received: see Minutes
Progress has been made in many areas.
It includes cooperation outside the EU.
First, climate change.
This is essential.
The agreement should be precise.
I will attend myself.
Indeed, I expect the Council to evolve.
The second topic is climate change.
This is essential.
Nevertheless, this is not enough.
That is much more important.
(Applause)
First of all, Copenhagen.
We have to make a success of it.
That is my fear for the moment.
We are going in the opposite direction.
We do not want mere token gestures.
That was my look back at last week.
The next summit will soon be upon us.
But this misses a vital point.
It is go, go, go all the time.
They are pro the EU.
We also need to discuss this subject.
In some ways she is ideal, is she not?
I mean, no one has ever heard of her.
She has risen without trace.
(Interjection from the floor)
But just hear the next bit.
That question must be asked.
That question must be answered.
Well, we have our two pygmies.
The European state is here.
I think this is the stake.
We have to stand up for them.
They have not been elected.
Could you please explain what that was?
I want to know.
(Protests)
That is my opinion, colleagues.
I think that is very good.
Thank you very much.
We are talking about actual cases.
I can give you concrete examples.
And we stand by it.
I would like to buck the trend.
Life is not going to be easier for us.
This is a major achievement.
I think that this is a very good idea.
We only need to listen to Mr Farage.
How is the EU responding to this?
Will this be on the Council agenda?
I very much doubt it, but it should be.
They do, indeed.
Today, however, things have changed.
Let me explain what I mean.
Firstly, the issue of appointments.
Let us move forward!
We owe it to them.
I believe that is a mistake.
Finally, I would like to say one thing.
Its time will be up.
(LV) Thank you, Mr President.
This process was untransparent.
Transparency must rule in the future.
This is in our common interest.
This fact speaks for itself.
Why should they be famous?
However, it is not just God's gift.
Thank you.
I think that this criticism is unfair.
What do we want?
A destroyer, a disrupter?
I wish him well.
Those days are over.
Times change.
I wish you all the best.
Europe has changed.
I wish you all the best.
Let us not disappoint them.
There was a question about Turkey.
This is an important step forward.
I think that is an excellent idea.
That concludes the debate.

That is not the society we want.
We have achieved a good result.

I therefore voted in favour.

Telecom (signature of acts)
I congratulate you all.
Our magnetism is still there.
This will be neither fast nor easy.
ICTY cooperation remains a must.
There has been good news in Serbia too.
He merits our full recognition.
That is a great pity, in my opinion.
We do not approve of that.
Let us be honest with the Turks.
I would like to make a few comments.
We think too much about this past.
There is one more thing.
So let us all work on them.
We need institutional reforms.
This is not right.
I will not even try.
It was rejected by the South.
The EU has a moral duty here.
That is what it is about.
I am about to conclude.
I would like to repeat that here.
That is not the problem.
It is not a path paved with roses.
The reason is simple.
A lot of the work is already done.
That is what Europe is about.
I am of exactly the same opinion.
It has done nothing.
Much has been achieved.
I think that is a source of strength.
I did listen to the debate.
I am sorry about that.
We won that narrowly.
It does not happen by itself.
It requires reforms.
It requires reconciliation.
And that applies to each and every one.
It applies to each and every one.
(Applause from the centre left)
So that is what we have to abide by.
I think that would be a mistake.
(Applause from the centre left)
I do not like the word.
Article 49 applies.
That is true.
Together we have made a difference.

The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The next item is the debate on:
That is not the case.
This is a public health problem.
It should be time for this now!
It is not only an equality issue.
There is no such thing as a stereotype.
The figures are alarming.
Talking about it is not enough.
It is time for action.
Apparently that is not enough.
This is not just a problem for women.
How do we combat sexism?
2.
It was horrible, simply horrible.
But it is also the truth.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Piracy is a very serious threat indeed.
This has proved helpful.
Much remains to be done.
No, that is certainly not the solution.
We think this is essential.
What is the real goal of this mission?
Why are we supporting it?
The first area is humanitarian aid.
Somalia is a big problem.
It has been a big problem for 20 years.
We discussed piracy.
But let us also be realistic.
Results have been fairly limited.
We are trying to do certain things.
No, there is not.
So it is indeed a very complex process.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
‚Ä¢ strengthening the AMISOM mission,
Smoke-free environments (debate)
They have all been outstanding.
The Council shares this view.
To legislate does not mean to oppress.
It is a completely absurd situation.
We can only protect workers.
They were furious about the ban.
People have come to live with it.
But let us not demonise smokers.
I agree with the points that she made.
There is a complete change.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
This is where the question arises.
Surely we can manage that in the EU.
Why? For two reasons.
We should practise what we preach.
We will therefore also support this.
The EU must take the lead.
The debate is closed.
The priority now is to honour them.
What has happened since then?
End of quote.
I will give but one example.
That country was Ukraine.
It happens in Madagascar, for instance.
Why did you not do that?
We produce a lot of food.
We accept that.
The rest of us will talk about it.
However, it is not just about money.
I think this really is an innovation.
The debate is closed.
Let me take traceability as an example.
This brings me to my next point.
This situation is simply unsustainable.
It is simply unfair.
That is what it is about.
I want to make it very clear.
Madam President, I will answer that.
It is quite simple.
That is clearly the case.
We are on the same side with this one.
I will be blunt.
This is not acceptable.
How can the consumer see any logic?
She could have answered more concisely.
You can be sure of that.
These two debates are linked.
But beef is a cash crop.
We have nothing to be ashamed of.
This is what we are doing.
We applied very strict rules.
I gave you the figures.
Problems were identified in Brazil.
They know that they will find defects.
We shall remain vigilant and strict.
If they do not, then they will not.

But all this is not enough.
My party considers this sordid.
If not, why not?
They are the easiest.
Congratulations!
This is where the problems lie.
That is not correct.
I agree with this.
I am not sure what this achieves.
We welcome this.
The final aspect is agriculture.
We must clean up their acts.

The audit opinion would be clean.

We must also look at the good news.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I thank you for this report.
You have the tools.
You need to react more rapidly.
This is my proposal.
That is my opinion.
Mr President, please do not give in.
(Applause)
Madam President, a simple question.
Do you accept that this is the case?
The answer is yes.
(Applause)
This is lost.
Now some points for the future.
That is a key issue.
That is normal life.
(Applause)
However, I will not need three minutes.
We will stop there.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
How should we react to this?
The interests of consumers are clear.
Do we still need them?
This brings me to your second question.
Europe has to act swiftly.
This is the central issue today.

The means therefore exist.
The legislative process must speed up.
Let us continue this discussion.

This is a step backwards.
and
I do not see any alternative to Doha.
That must not happen.
We call for a new start to the process.
Might you work towards a solution?
Blame the crisis.
(Applause)

The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Thank you very much.
We must dare to make real choices.
Firstly, this is an unjust measure.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Car sales have fallen by 59.4%.
That is very much to be welcomed.
The future of the sector is at stake.


If they are helped, they will deliver.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday.
That is the current situation.
They employ a huge number of people.
Madam President, I am rather surprised.
The issue of funding is more serious.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We cannot agree with this proposal.
Private capital has also dried up.
However, that is not enough.
That is two thirds!
It was refused.
This is not about a begging hand.
(The President cut off the speaker)
My conclusions are as follows.
We need new money for new ideas.
100 million is the very beginning.
I think that this is unacceptable.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.

Toy safety (debate)
The second question is simple, too.
I am talking about China.
The letter concerned cadmium.
This is where the problem lies.
Children ask for toys in these letters.
So we need to bear that in mind.
That was the background to this.
I believe that is urgently needed.
These substances can be avoided.
It must be done quicker than that.
I want to make that point here, too.
Allow me to make a preliminary comment.
You can judge that for yourselves.
You cannot do that.
I cannot do that and neither can you.
I cannot assume this responsibility.
Not one of you can do that either.
Tests are needed.
I am sorry, but that is not possible.
I hope that makes it clear.
That is something we can take pride in.
It takes time.

Thank you for the floor, Mr President.
What did we want to achieve?
This facility is worth EUR 36 billion.
The outcome has been beneficial.
This is exactly what has happened.
This is where we are now.
We have an exciting time ahead of us.
This was indeed a difficult constraint.
There are barely any margins left.
Now comes the moment of truth.
It is five years since enlargement.
This was a motto coined by Mr Surj√°n.
We must become a low-carbon economy.
What is it that I want to say?
It is too big and it keeps growing.
The EU budget is an exception.
It was a sign of bad planning.
We all know it would not.
That is the crucial issue.
Does this say something to you?
May we thank them all.
What risks and problems can be seen?
Where is the risk?
This is a successful set of priorities.
We should have been rather stricter.
This is objectionable and unacceptable.
I will give you an example.
The answer is 'no'.
Let us not fool ourselves.
We are at a turning point.
My answer goes without saying.
I am looking forward to this.
This has become a very urgent problem.
They have become our sacred cow.
However, our margins are dwindling.
Thank you for your attention.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We have pulled in our horns.
Thank you Mr Gallagher.
I have five observations to make.
We have achieved a lot.
Everything else becomes secondary.
This will improve our competitiveness.
That is not the case, of course.
It is all about choices.
However, they are key people.
I would like to thank them all.
Thank you very much.
We cannot wait until 2014 for reform.
We know how to stop this happening.
The joint debate is closed.

Open questions
Will you take the initiative?
Are you Mr 2020?
The situation today is different.
I expect the Commission to do so.
Let us be honest about it.
We need you to explain this.
That is the task.
Because Tata owns Corus.
(Protests from the floor)
You did not answer the question.
Would you please answer it?
I am sorry about that.
Do they have the right to do so?
The question is clear.
(Applause)
The reality is already complex enough.
That is our position and it is clear.
It was refused by the Member States.
Unfortunately, it was not possible.
Thank you, Mrs Ries.
It is only natural!
(NL) Mr President.
Colleagues, this is very important.
(Laughter)
I will try to choose the best question!
Let me tell you my personal opinion.
That is an interesting debate.
Let us see if we agree on this matter.
I think it would be a good idea.
(Applause)
I would like to underline that point.
There are several ideas.
I am aware of your report.
This is my personal thinking.
There are 750 Members in this place.
I think 30 minutes is ridiculous.
Can we not have an hour and a half?
Come here for 90 minutes, not 60.
We must decide about that.
Thank you for your proposal.
We have fulfilled this promise.
This causes us concern.
This is an area of deep concern.
That was 16 years ago.
They should be part of the solution.

It is very important to emphasise this.
What does Israel have to hide?
We must give this our clear support.
I believe we all agree on this.
Absolutely not!
We will see where she sits!
Nothing is new under the sun.
That is the choice we have to make.

We must vigorously defend human rights.
We must act.
I am not talking about sanctions.
Let us not beat about the bush.
Nothing new, they said.
They treat us with contempt.
Well, we have the policy.
It is in the conclusions.
Now what about the action?
On this basis, I have two questions.
The first is:

May I say one more thing.
I agree with what has been said.
Therefore, I congratulate the Council.
I hope that she will continue to do so.
What lies behind this?
It is a serious report.
This must include all of the issues.
The solution must be comprehensive.
The nuances are important.
What is our relationship to be?
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The next item is:
Take the UN blacklist, for example.
No.
This was not the case previously.
Our view is as follows:
These fundamental rights are important.
That is all for now.
But I take the point very well.
At this stage, I do not know.
The advice we have is clear.
The debate is closed.
The vote shall take place tomorrow.
The next item is the joint debate on
It allowed accountability.
Now we need another commitment.
We have a register of documents.
We need to enhance access to documents.
We welcome this.
That is not always easy.
That is my starting point.
They want rapid delivery.
Real concrete and direct delivery.
You have tried to bypass us.
I do not want to discuss the content.
You fail to provide this.
We should not adopt this resolution.
What is the document number?
The focus must be on citizens.
She made a series of accusations.
One that I had not been transparent.
Finally, it was remiss of me.
This is a very positive thing.
Pending this, there is much we can do.
Let me just state some basic facts.
It is the only proposal on the table.
This is where we will continue.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Situation in Georgia (debate)
We will help them do this.
We also need to look forwards.
No, it is an act of brutal imperialism.
What did she do wrong?
Did her behaviour irritate the rapist?
Did she oppose his demands?
The situation is, indeed, dramatic.
It means that success will never come.
Thank you.
Therefore, the Union must try harder.
The youngest is barely 14 years old.
What will be the timetable?
Please answer this question.
It seems that this is a problem for us.
This is not true at all.
This is absolutely clear.
This is the number one political issue.
This is the first point.
Absolutely.
We cannot.
The debate is closed.
We are already seeing positive signs.
This means that we have not finished.
This is what these countries need.
That is the request we are making.
Yes, I do.
The number of suicides is rising.
The lesson from this is obvious.
The situation was exactly the opposite.
The Commissioner mentioned Estonia.
This only increases the disproportions.
(The President cut off the speaker)
My country, Portugal, is an example.
Several different paths can be taken.
Cohesion has to be effective.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
You know what I am referring to here.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is not the problem.
Do we need to cooperate more?
Of course we do.
Of course we do.
I shall continue in my mother tongue.
(ES) I agree.
We agree in many respects.
We are going to continue to do this.
I really hope not!
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The debate is closed.
Finally, de-politicising the debate.
The next item is the debate on:
It does not deny it at all.
We cannot explain that to our citizens.
Let the judges do their jobs.
I will now conclude.
This is a good thing.
We are proud of our religious freedom.
This is unlawful.
I must warn you of this.
The cross does not bother us.
I say: shame on the Commission.
I am obliged to say this, quite simply.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The answer is quite simple.
It is the freedom to practise religion.
Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes
Closure of the sitting
Opening of the sitting
There is no final decision.
So we must wait.
That understanding is in force.
It is too early to discuss this.
We are going to hold talks about this.
The matter is absolutely clear.
The next item is the joint debate on:
I know that this is not enough.
I know what they say about this.
Then the drama unravelled.
But then the unexpected happened.
Thank you for giving us that help.
This unity is our strength.
Let us be frank about this.
It is now for others to match it.
There is a huge amount at stake.
That is definitely one benefit.
(Heckling)
Thank you very much.
I will gladly admit that here.
The reduction target is inadequate.
I will say one last thing to finish.
I will try to observe the time limit.
This is why we are for peace.
I have not seen it.
What conclusion can be drawn from this?
That is what the European public wants.
Please respect us as well.
We have taken that time.
My second comment concerns Copenhagen.
Then show me who the leader is.
I have not seen that yet.
We are now down to -12%.
(Applause)
Is this enough to reach the 2 ¬∞C?
No, it is not enough.
So let us be honest with each other.
Please tell us the truth.
There are two reasons for this.
What happened to the emissions targets?
Stop Vattenfall's legal proceedings!
You have power over this enterprise.
I would like to single out two issues.
The second area is climate policy.
Europe has achieved results.
We must remain realistic!
What is the point of that?
I can only reject that argument.
This was very important.
Certainly not.
Why?
(Applause)
These events have created hope.
There is still work to be done.
A lot has been done.
You all deserve a Happy New Year!
(NL) Mr President.
This is a blemish on your Presidency.
Let us look to the future.
Good luck!
My third point is financial regulation.
I apologise once again.
A job well done!
I thank the Swedish Presidency.
Thank you very much.
We will remember your presidency.
Let me be clear on this matter.

This prize belongs by right to them.
He advanced two major propositions.
What is there to say in this regard?
A mere handful.
Where are they all?
Murdered.
And this is a basis for hope.
Yet what happens?
Nothing.
How is this opportunity used?
(Applause)
Such fear can spread throughout Russia.
Yet what can stand up to fear?
We are proud to receive it today.
An overall initiative is required.
This was adopted in October.
The basic strategy is already in place.
That is behind us.
By this I do not mean withdrawal.
Nobody would question this.
The international community is there.
That is the core of our action plan.
We are ready to put in more resources.
But that is all just the start.
The Afghan GDP is just EUR 6.9 billion.
We need someone more experienced.
Come on!
Why is Europe in Afghanistan?
It is too serious for EU posturing.
Time is running out!
Today, those camps no longer exist.
Today, Kabul is a huge entrenched camp.
What are the consequences of all this?
Can we pull out straight away, today?
We must accept that.
This has been done today.
Is that really the case?
Are we being honest in what we say?
We cannot fail.
That was in 2001.
What, then, is the goal?
These questions need to be answered.
It always wins!
It is much more complex than that.
Thirty years of war is a huge problem.
I will answer some of your questions.
It is absolutely central.
This must continue.
These are the Afghan priorities.
The EU is one partner.
That is the signal we must send out.
This is going to take time.
We have to be realistic.
There is always room for that.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)

Belarus (debate)
It has three main elements.
Our full support is therefore required.

This is the issue.

This is not a contradiction.
They, too, are waiting for this signal.
I know this from my own experience.
They deserve a clear and plain answer.
Today, I have another idea.
Please say this publicly.
It will be a Christmas present for us.
This is good.
Why was her name removed?
Now it is up to them to respond.
What could the EU do for Belarus?
What is on offer?
This is what I mean by pragmatism.
Our message to Belarus is clear.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
That is to be welcomed.
These now have to be implemented.
The situation is unstable in many ways.
This approach must now be applied.
It can be a normal country.
I remember the optimism of 2006.
So what is being defended in the Congo?
Humanity?
Embargoes have been ineffective so far.
The fronts are always changing.
This is important work for Mrs Ashton.
The phenomenon is not new.
They are the future of Congo.
But, nevertheless, that is the reality.
They did a tremendous job.
We did excellent work in Chad.
They must be brought to justice.
In such a large country, it is modest.
Let me just focus on three things.
That is a very interesting question.
There is no such thing as a free lunch.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
Subject: Ethnic minorities in Serbia
They will do that, of course.
There are still difficulties there.
Subject: Unemployment levels
Thank you for your answer.
Maybe there was a translation problem.
I did not refer to any micro-authority.
Do you have any comment on this?
Discussions are ongoing.
They have been mandated.
This is the usual procedure.
They are being followed.
Some are more successful than others.
You have been a star performer.
There is no way we will give up.
The world is expecting results from us.
Some countries have made a mixture.
If so, why?
This needs to be discussed further.
We have had negotiations.
We wish him well in that.
Questions 8 and 9 have been withdrawn.
This is a very important statement.
Thank you for this.

Let me now turn to the first question.
But there is not only Solvit.
In 2007, it was implemented.
This is a very serious matter.
This shows contempt for Parliament.
(Heckling)
Yes?
Yes, he did not get up.
Well, I am sorry. I cannot accept that.
There are a number of causes.
This could have been done much earlier.
However, I do welcome the guidelines.
That will be the second important step.
Why is that?
This is a responsibility for all of us.
That has already been mentioned.

Subsidiarity works for Europe.
For me, the answer is clear.
We are familiar with this process.

This is a fundamental issue for us.
Such a reform is simply unimaginable.
My second point is about secrecy.
We do not need renationalisation.
The debate is closed.

I think this is immoral.
I repeat, it is utterly immoral.

I hope it is successful.
Globalism has destroyed our industries.
The banks have ruined our economies.
We must beat fate.
That has been conclusive up to now.
That is enough.
When is this going to end?
We just need to use them.
Parliament will follow you.
Do not wait for the next disaster!
None of this was foreseeable.
Shame on you.
Let us make sure that we coordinate.
Forget the political rhetoric.

I await your answer.
Why did we not seize this opportunity?
Why should we continue to do so?
The question is: how to deal with it?
It would have strengthened them.
They wanted that.
Enough is enough.
No more talk; no more appeasement.
We need tough sanctions.
(HU) Three short questions.
I deplore that fact very much.
Many of them were blinded.

We should seek talks.

Situation in Iraq (debate)
I look forward to our debate.
There are, indeed, positive signs.
Why am I worried?
I would appreciate a response from you.
That is a fact.
Iran is threatening Iraq.
Is this being taken into consideration?
Thank you on behalf of the ALDE Group.
Suicide attacks continue.
That is the plain truth of it.
That is the plain truth.
The picture is therefore very gloomy.
Many will never be able to return.
These decisions are difficult.
That is clearly of great significance.
It is for Iraq to deal with.
That point was well made.
How long?
This we still do not know.
This must change.
We see our contribution in all of that.
I would like to stress two points.
This is the 10th EDF.
Mr Michel spoke about this.
I would like to stress three points.
Thank you.
However, much remains to be done.
Let us, therefore, support self-help.
Let us promote self-sufficiency.

No, it was possible to implement it.
In reality, it was an old nag.
You have our greatest respect for that.

It is destroying social cohesion.

So, I wish you good luck, Mr Zapatero.

We all agree on this.

Where needed, we must have sanctions.
It must be a good omen, though!
It is either one thing or the other.
One cannot have it both ways.
We must say it, we must recognise it.
No, it was not the right method.
Therefore, the strategy has to change.

We must be realistic on this matter.
That must be the aim.
With whom?
With the United States and with China.

You see, I am no sectarian.
You talk of growth, but what growth?
What type of growth?
We can do it, if we want to.

Fine!
Socialism does not do that.
That issue is Iran.
Welcome, Mr Rodr√≠guez Zapatero.
This is the actual reality.
They are damaging!
We need civil protection.
We do not agree with this summit.
I will now refer to a reality.

Mr Zapatero, we want a solution now.
I would like to clarify something.
I am therefore a convert.
This is not an ideological problem.
It is a problem of reality.
This is something different.
I think this is an important matter.
That is my opinion.
Mr Schulz, thank you for your words.
We are aware of this.
Government requires a Community method.
Also, it works.
(Applause)
It is for us to join forces.
That is not what we are debating.
These are the objectives.
I have taken note of your suggestions.
(Applause)
We do not have to go very far.
That is all on the first question.
The Commission.
Let us be clear on this point too.
That is not the case.
There is, therefore, joint monitoring.
(Comment made off-microphone)
A stronger Europe!
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Barroso.
Transitions are always an opportunity.
(Applause)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Does this not seem a bad symptom?
(ES) Prime Minister, welcome.
What is your message to us?
What is the substance of what you said?
How have you responded to the crisis?
How can you coordinate things here?
We call for your leadership.
Then we will support you.
He is the example you should follow.
(ES) Hello, Mr Rodr√≠guez Zapatero.
What has happened, Mr Zapatero?
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Here is the first challenge.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is a very ambitious aim.
That is a good thing.
I wish you much success!
Forewarned is forearmed.
Why was nothing said about tax havens?
Let us consider the following.
Haste comes at the expense of quality.
I have two questions.
It is a European problem.
It is a problem of free movement.
I am sorry, Prime Minister.
Welcome

It is a real problem.
We have that right.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We really do need action now.
You have committed yourself to this.
You can count on our solidarity.
Women for Zapatero!
I think it was an exceptional speech.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I have two questions.
One relates to foreign policy.
To what interests do you refer?
Another question.
We need a programme...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Your response would be most welcome.
I wish to refer to immigration.
(Applause)
(Applause)
This is a fundamental conclusion.
Secondly, subsidiarity and languages.

SWIFT (debate)
It is a provisional agreement.
This is the present situation.
There are two sides to the coin.
However, we cannot take that seriously.
Why is that?
So there is no hurry.
I would like to ask you one more thing.
Only one MEP was present in Brussels.
That MEP happened to be me.
How can a European citizen feel safe?
Therefore, it is valid.
That is the reason it has arrived now.
I agree absolutely.
This will depend on you.
The debate is closed.
Please proceed.
Please proceed, Minister.
I repeat what I said.
Please proceed, Mr Schulz.
This is not a sound procedure.
The facts will show this.
It is as simple as that.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
We have shared goals and strategies.
This is no small task we are facing.
Our credibility is at stake.
We have to stand our ground.
We are indeed at a crossroads today.
The Copenhagen Summit was a failure.
That would be regaining the initiative.
A figure of 30% has been mentioned.
Mrs Hassi just mentioned 40%.
I am fully in favour of that.
Clarity is needed.
The world is cooling.
Global warming is a fraud.
This is not a victimless crime.
That is why it is a disappointment.
It is not.
That is not a good sign.
The truth is we do not know the way.
We are stumbling around in the dark.
Thirdly, the climate.
Therefore, the EU must now promise 30%.
And what were the lessons?
What should we do?
When are you all going to wake up?
Scam, scam, scam!
It ended in failure.
Why should this be?
Of course you would.
Obviously, we can criticise the US.
He is quite right in his conclusion.
We need a climate jobs strategy.
We currently have a 20% target.
It is even worse than this.
Time really is running out.
So what should Europe do now?
So what needs to be done?
These cannot be seen as a consolation.
I was right, like 92 others here.
(Applause)
They are both, of course.
(The President cut off the speaker)
It all went wrong in Copenhagen.
It could also be called a defeat.
This is a rather bureaucratic approach.
Firstly, do not walk alone next time.
Secondly, no one size fits all.
We have nothing.
We need a univocal mandate.
Europe really needs one voice.
That mandate was not successful.
We cannot pursue an ostrich policy.
Thank you for your attention.
One thing is clear.
Let us look at solutions.
We are lacking that vision.
We are miles away from our objectives.
I am thinking here of Japan and Norway.
What will be the impact on that system?
Can you tell us that?
Copenhagen was a failure.
That is true.
Thank you for your attention.
So what are we to do now?
It will be similar in Mexico, too.
Positive results should be achieved.
What exactly is happening?
That is part of the problem.
How are we going to resolve this?
It is a big problem for the EU.
This is how not to do things.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)

We have concluded this session.
We must learn and move forward.
We must not succumb to complaining.
I count on your support for this goal.
This is an important sign.
Some progress has been made, however.
Question Time (Council)
There are no restrictions to supply.
I suggest that you look at the Rules.
President-in-Office of the Council.
Subject: EU integration of Kosovo
I referred to the visa system earlier.
Is it right to keep troops in Kosovo?
So, ¬°viva Espa√±a!
I agree with the first speech.
I do not know about the rest of Europe.
The Council spoke about guidelines.
That is what it is there for.
Some of them are already operating.
Subject: EU financial supervision
This is the Council's objective.
Parliament knows these articles.
Hence, there is solidarity.
That concludes Question Time.

Democratisation in Turkey (debate)
Hence I conclude, Madam President.
My very warm thanks to you.
These promises must be realised.
We must make an unambiguous commitment.
That was explicitly the second strand.
That is a big question.
Yes, Turkey is making progress.
Much of it is noteworthy.
We should tell it as much.
Let us play it by ear.
It needs and deserves democracy.
The EU should do something about it!
Our uncertainty has a cost.
These must be met.
Democracy is vital, of course.
This was a courageous step forward.
This development must continue.
There are still major shortcomings.
Women have also been treated unfairly.
We expect a rapid response.
Therefore, stop the negotiations!
Secondly, negotiation.
That has been irrefutably demonstrated.
We must be very clear with Turkey.
That outlines the situation.
It depends on how you see it.
I will not repeat it now.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
They call it 'soft power'.
Now there is yet another party ban.
However, this applies to Turkey, too!
Thank you for your attention.
Financial resources are also needed.
Common areas of activity exist here.
There are many ways to go about this.
The Danube is a natural treasure.
Thank you for your attention.
I am Dutch.
How can there be too much water?
Thank you.
There are many common topics.

No.
No.
I repeat, these date back to Bourguiba.
I will end there, Mr President.
Economically, they are progressing.
But look at what Tunisia did.
There has been mention of equality.
There are problems.
Firstly, reinforced institutions.
The project has many components.

The Egyptian authorities react quickly.
There are three points I want to raise.
Do we really want this?
They were kept in inhumane conditions.
(Applause)

At stake is our credibility.

That was not a point of order.
Thursday:
I think that we can save Madagascar.
(Parliament rejected the request)
(The order of business was adopted)
(The President cut off the speaker)
They also discussed other major issues.
But why am I telling this House?
This does not improve airport security.
There are two new challenges.
However, the second matter is Belarus.
It is, indeed, a tragic case.
Thank you very much.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The Prophet says: kill the Jews.'
Such a situation was incongruous.

We welcome all this.
We have here:
Amendments have been drafted.
All this is important.
The other concern is transfer pricing.
Thank you, Commissioner Kov√°cs.
No.
Yet that is not the case.
I wish him a happy retirement.
Have a happy retirement, Commissioner.
CCCTB is one of those proposals.
I was not here when you arrived.
I wish you all the best.
Tax competition is a jolly good thing.
I did not do it, but others did.
Why do we need another 200 new jobs?
What is all that for?
These are matters of great importance.
There remains much to do in this area.


The Member States' coffers are empty.
It relates to fundamental choices.
Thank you and good luck.
Firstly, high rates of tax.
The more exemptions, the more fraud.
Of course we are in favour.
Unfortunately, this is an upward trend.
Thank you.
However, I do have three concerns.
This is a matter of public ethics.
Laws must be straightforward.
Tax competition is a good thing.
I have been known to do so myself.
Thank you and good luck.
It affects countries across borders.

We have to consider that.
No, they are not.
We really cannot afford this.
That might be the PIGS.
Only that will lead to progress!
I would just like to make two comments.
The joint debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
GM/Opel: current developments (debate)
What does this mean in specific terms?
Do they have good reason to hope?
Perhaps.
This is the way people feel.
Let us look to the future for once.
It is even a threat to driver safety.
Radical change is now required.
Nobody will understand that over there!
That is absolutely crucial.
I endorse it completely.
What does this have to do with justice?
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
We must keep them in mind too.
Let us turn to employment.
Let us turn to paternity leave.
Some progress has been made.
The opposite is true in fact.
No.
It was not around when I was young.
We should look at that seriously.
I wish you every success Commissioner.
No!
I have some questions.
What added value would it bring?
There is none.
The charter is the main issue.
We can no longer change that today.
We have to change that.
Thank you and good luck!
We must, together, make such proposals.
Equal opportunities do exist on paper.
Then there will be no need for quotas.
I have heard this question many times.
(Heckling)
Yours has?
That is not equality, either.
Equality does pay off!
This must be changed.
There are three conclusions.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The reason is tradition.
It is cultural.
I wish you all the best and God bless!

Welcome, everyone.
Welcome to our guests.
The vote will be held at 12.00.
We all believe this.
And then?
Then what?
This is a time for boldness.
And the answer is 'yes'.
The answer is 'not yet'.
Frankly, I believe we have to do more.
I said we need to be bold.
(Applause)
Welcome.
Legislation is not everything, however.
However, we must be ambitious.
(Applause)
(Applause)
This, however, is the wrong approach.
They do not require renationalisation.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
That is the most important task.
Be ambitious on this point, Mr Barroso.
Come armed with ambitious projects.
(Applause)
So, this is really ...
(Applause)
Calm down, my friend, calm down!
Incapable!
Why?
Me?
No, there are none.
This is not the way we do politics.
What has been said is true.
No, it does not work like that.
Solidarity, where is it?
In Spain, where is it?
Let me give you a piece of advice.
4.3% of Greece's GDP goes on defence.
What is the problem?
We will not make progress like that.
We want a political Europe.
Mr Verheugen is leaving the Commission.
There are enough of them.
That is unworthy of this Parliament.
(Applause)
I wish you much success in this.
Mr Barroso himself was a Maoist.
Today we have 'shared values'.
You can laugh, you can smile.
It will not work.
It cannot work.
We need democratic solutions to this.
We must vote against this Commission.
(Applause)
We are counting on this.
That is the bottom line.
This is not the case here.


Let me give an example.
Words are not sufficient, however.
So that has got worse.
Quite simply, it is not good enough.
Nowhere.
How can they be dismissed?
They cannot.
What lies at the heart of democracy?
It is national sovereignty.
This is a basic principle.
(Applause)
This will be a difficult policy.
We all need to change our attitude.
The shortcomings are clear.
Greece needs help, of course.
For this, we need a strong Europe.
You have our support to do so.
The single vote must end.
We need clear areas of responsibility.

On this, Parliament will support you.
They represent barely 13% of Members.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Can we trust the Commission?
That is not how things are, however.
My best wishes, President Barroso!




He has succeeded in this.

(Applause)
Now, all of them will do so.
That is a good thing.
I am completely happy with this.



At the same time, there are worries.
I hope it will be sustainable.
They expect bold and clear projects.
Take foreign policy, for example.
Present these proposals to the Council.
You do not have it yet.
They enjoy working extra hours.
It is up to them.
We have good reasons for doing so.
Anyone can see what the reasons are.
We need to take this action now.
No!
We need strong institutions.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Then we will have overcome the crisis.
I would like an answer to that.
We should have a real economic union.
There is no point in denying it.
Let us also recognise that.
By its nature, it is a European policy.
I disagree.
That is not what we are proposing.
(Applause)
We are living in unprecedented times.
Where in the world does Europe count?
We have a common policy.
We have institutions.
We have the basis on which to act.
We need the various institutions.
That is our system.
With power comes responsibility.
Let us be clear on this point.
I do not need that kind of support.
That, I do ask of you.
What is the real problem?
Let us be clear on this subject too.

No true European ...

There is also another fact.
Many have called for a strong Europe.
That should remain the goal of Europe.
Written explanations of vote
They are internationalists.
This is a dangerous tendency.
None of this happened.
That explains my 'No' vote.
We can be truly proud.
It has no democratic legitimacy.
That is what we are concerned about.
That will need to be organised.
Action was taken far too late.
We have heard it all.
What does this mean?
If so, which ones?
They have failed resoundingly.
There is a huge difference.
Yet what are we seeing today?
The budget deficit is approaching 13%.
Europe had to and would expand.
What is happening now?
Join us at your peril.
Europe cannot be left behind.
This is the wrong message.
Euro-philanthropists?
A duopoly will always be unstable.
Greece or the United States?
No one!
Is this really the European dream?
And yet the spreads increased.
And what about the European Commission?
How can we fight this?
It is a test for the euro itself.
I wish you well.
The result is bankruptcy.
The same applies to governments.
Thank you.
This is not a statistical matter.
Eurostat does not compile the data.
That is all I ask.
The support cannot be free of charge.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Several questions arise:
Others gave background support.
Others pretended not to see.
Europe must do more as well.
It was made in the EU.
I therefore welcome this step.
It should be praised to the skies.
It is exemplary.
It must serve as an example.
It affects all of us.
That is my first comment.
The first matter is Yemen.
They were mentioned by the Minister.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the debate on:
Firstly, there is the African Elephant.
Secondly, there is the Asian tiger.
I now come to the controversial issue.
That is the conflict that we face.
The first is Atlantic bluefin tuna.
Tuna stocks are collapsing.
Japan is stockpiling en masse.
'Conservation of tuna'!
Species have dropped by 80 to 90%.
It has failed completely.
Appendix II will make no difference.
There will be no tuna left.
That very biodiversity is crucial.
I agree.
The instrument works.
That is the current reality.
The statistics speak for themselves.
These include tuna, cod and salmon.
But it is clear that it is not enough.

It is possible to reconcile these two.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
But do we have the same situation here?
Of course, we have to be pragmatic.
- C7-0095/2009 -
I am looking forward to the debate.

We do not have the room.
It is about space, not race.
Immediate and joint action is needed.
This is an alarming figure.
This is an eminently European issue.
It went, 'Oh, to have a little house!
To own the hearth, the stool and all!
The new text stipulates a rate of 4%.
I much appreciate it.
The second comment on the substance.

I hope this will also be this year.
Where is Turkey heading?
We agree.
I would like to emphasise two things.
This is terrifying and it is a crime.
These are absolutely crucial elements.
Why are so few chapters open?
Why is this important?
We in Parliament should welcome that.
That seems rather strange to me.
This is a good thing.
That, of course, is not a good thing.
We think that is very good.
All of this is very unfortunate.
I do not think that this is the case.
This seems to me very strange.
This is very important.
That is European law.
Your hearing was truly superb.
This is a political reality.
Some of the amendments are positive.
Greece must strike its own balance.
We must give a clear 'yes' or 'no'.
Confidence-building is sorely required.
Turkey should send signals.
The time to act is now.
This is a very important issue.
(Applause)
Let there be no illusions about this.
I wish you every success in your work.
Croatia is in the home straight.
However, one thing is clear.
The process will never be linear.
We should be aware of this.
Turkey and Cyprus are neighbours.
That policy should not be held back.
We have not kept our promise.
The second factor is privatisation.
What can we do?
We need instruments in this process.
Can I ask Mrs Flautre a question?
Addressed to whom and for what purpose?
I mentioned this just now in my speech.

It does not avoid taxation.
It is time to stop this imperialism.
Thank you, Mr President.
I wanted to stress this point.
It is the main international donor.
And what thanks did they get?
If he intervenes, he is imperialist.
If he does not, he is isolationist.
The first reason is specific.
This has not been done so far.
We took a firm stance at Copenhagen.
Maybe we should consider why that was.
Glaciers are not melting everywhere.
So, really, what should we be doing?
We do not agree with this.
I think human life deserves better.
Perhaps they have not read it.
Result - explosion of elephant numbers.
(CS) I will be very brief again.
Written explanations of vote
However, I discern an error in it.
Thus, the Member States loses twice.



I therefore voted in favour.
Haiti will need help for a long time.
You cannot tot up pain.
Therein also lies hope.
We must act cautiously in this case.
I am in agreement with this.
For these reasons, I have abstained.
There are national embassies.
This is a first step.
You are irresponsible!
I have voted against the resolution.
A CCCTB is not about a common tax rate.
That is why I voted against recital 25.
It could become a European resource.
Malta is against abortion.
We must reveal it for what it is.
I voted against this resolution.
I voted against the resolution.
I voted in favour of this resolution.
That is indispensable.
That proposal was not adopted.
It is aimed at protecting this species.
All the Member States are party to it.
I voted against this paragraph.
I sincerely hope that it will.
There are other basic issues.
Mistakes have to be admitted.
These are dreadful developments.
We are fully aware of this.
This is important.
Why hide behind the Commission?
Tell me; I am all ears.
(Applause)
That was the decision taken.
It may not have been the best decision.
Thank you, Mr Rubalcaba.
It is very important to us.
This is important.
It can - and it will - be improved.
This is important.
We wanted it to be a strong signal.
I would like to make that very clear.
That is a mistake.
You have done so yourself.
How long will the data be stored?
Who is storing it?
Who is passing it on to whom?
It is a pleasure to see you here.
That, Council, is the only way.
(Applause)
We must take action now.
But you could not do even this today.
SWIFT tells us that is not the case.
Where are they?
(The President cut off the speaker)
There are 11 people on the list.
We must not do this.
It is a poor agreement.
I would like to raise two matters.
I strongly emphasise the word 'all'.
Once again, postponement will not help.
Council, let us step back.
We have time.
Let us defer.
We cannot allow this.
How can it be negotiated?
This is just one example.
Why do we have it?
This is important to recall.
We must take a decision tomorrow.
This is precisely what I am asking for.
It is very non-committal.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
There are five conclusions.

We cannot ignore this fact.
The Denver flight showed that recently.
I will do so this year.
You gave us a very hopeful prospect.
Now we must look to the future.
That is where the problem lies.
This is another thought for the future.

We need more security in this area.
What type of technology is being used?
What type of radiation do they emit?
Can they cause damage to health?
What do they allow people to see?
Also, these scanners are expensive.
No surprise there.
Each machine cost EUR 250 000.
Is this where we want to end up?
We are very happy about this.
This is a serious fight.


Mr President, back to body scanners.
I fundamentally object to that policy.
So much for body scanners.
What do these figures tell us?
Secondly, the war on terror has failed.
Is this really the case today?
Nothing is less certain.
What utter nonsense!
Firstly, is it necessary and effective?
There are, however, other concerns.
These are the names I will call out.
Mr Zasada
Mr Iacolino
Mr Matula
Mr Leichtfried
Mr Enciu
Ms Fla≈°√≠kov√° Be≈àov√°
Mr Tannock
Ms Ernst
Ms Rivasi
and Mr M√∂lzer.
One minute each, and that is it.
Apologies to the rest of you.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
The only aim of terrorism is death.
We need to ask ourselves two questions.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is not the case.
So do not demonise new technologies.
This is totally natural.
We will do this.
The debate is closed.
Many possibilities exist.
You would agree this is an abuse.
Situation in Ukraine (debate)
Elections have winners and losers.
It is the electorate who decides.
Action is needed at many levels.
We have many tools to do so.

We must give them perspectives.
Now to the matter in hand.
And all of this is very important.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Have we answered that question?
Mrs Ashton has not come, today.
What would we expect from the EU?
Solidarity.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Election promises must be fulfilled.
Question Time (Council)
Subject: Freedom of religion in China
I have two brief additional questions.
I thank the Council for its reply.
A lot done; a lot more to do.
It is very carefully phrased.
This continues to be our opinion.
Question Time is closed.
Composition of Parliament: see Minutes
It is a pleasure to see you here.
A year ago, I was extremely concerned.
However, no trade war came about.
The crisis has not passed.
I would like to return to these ideas.
This is the other side of the coin.
(The President cut off the speaker)
But what does the Commission do?
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
We have one result in South Korea.
How can this be achieved?
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
We are also facing a new world order.
Hopefully, the major part is behind us.
I think that is the only good response.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
That is a very good thing.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We want a decision quickly.
The FTA is currently being translated.
Mr Caspary also made this point.
Is this a perfect deal?
Well, of course it is not.
Yes.
Is it a good deal for Korea?
Yes.
Yes.
This is the first major FTA.
This is a template.
We need to do it right.
Please do not get me wrong.
I am a strong proponent of FTAs.
Employees in the EU deserve better.
Allow me to spot a connection there.
Where does this figure come from?
On what study is it based?
Who will benefit from this?
That is very much the case.
I am not able to understand this fully.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We realise, however (...).
(The President cut off the speaker)
The safeguard clauses are a proposal.
This is what really matters.

Take the case of Juliet Young.
We took a while to persuade him to act.
They formulated that agreement.
I am glad that they have.
We cannot amend it.
Council cannot amend it.
It is their agreement.
They are not covered by this agreement.
I congratulate Commissioner Andor.
An issue was raised about the cost.
I will mention some statistics here.
This is very important.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Let us hope that things improve.
The debate is closed.
That cannot be right.
Let me start with your first question.
You simply have to face this fact.
It means that gamblers usually lose.
In addition, gambling is addictive.
Is it parents or someone else?
This beggars belief.
That is the most important point.
Good luck.
We are in a state of tension.
We must accept our responsibility.
If so, how will it be tackled?
There are upsides and downsides.
Otherwise, they are mere aspirations.
It is a complex problem.
What direction should we take though?
Ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake.
I think that it is impossible.
I shall continue to listen to you.

Democracy simply does not exist.
However, this is not the right place.
Let us also be more consistent.
This is unacceptable.
Let me be very clear.
I am not a Ch√°vez follower.
However this is not today's debate.
Therefore, there is not even a case.
There is no point.

This is the place.
I simply had to ask that question.
Why, therefore, should we not react?
We are talking about freedom.
The debate is closed.

Order of business
Thursday:
(DE) Mr President, I will be brief.
(Applause)
So what has changed?
In reality, it is neither.
Where are we going?
How to deal with our neighbours?
These are vital issues.
(Applause)
This requires a joint effort.
These priorities are not unfamiliar.
What do we need in order to succeed?
That is why we need to act together.




Can we tolerate this any more?
The PPE Group does not think so.
What answers can you give them?
We have to find solutions to that.
(Applause)
Is that what you are advocating?
(Applause)
Be sure.
(Heckling)
It is definitely in need of reform.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Europe 2020 must not go the same way.
The stakes could not be higher.
We are now entering a new era.
We hope those states will liberalise.
(Heckling)
Well, I am afraid what we got was you.
(Protests)
(Loud protests)
Is this European democracy?
(Reactions)
I prefer to go ahead.
That way, you will be happy.
(Applause)
(Applause)
You know, it has to be...
It cannot be one way ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
The solution is not 'more Europe'.
This needs to change.
Freedoms also bring responsibilities.
Not even 30% is ambitious.
(The President cut off the speaker)
There are no really new approaches.
How do we solve this dilemma?
This is the question I put to you.
It depends on two elements.
It is you we are counting on.
They have both feet on the brakes.
The alternative is that dramatic.
We should be looking at 40% by 2020.
The monetary union is not enough.
We need political union.
Europe does not expose, it protects.
Europe does not suffer, it acts.
You are a man of great quality.
Love them and they will love you back.
No, as yet we do not.
How to accomplish this?
Greece is not asking for money.
It is asking for something else.
We must not bury our heads in the sand.
(Applause)
One example is the social aspect.
I will explain.
That did not happen during the 1930s.
Because we have taken measures.
We have not had them today.
I would even go a step further.
This is where it gets difficult.
However, we should think about this.
One final word about Greece.
It is taking some brave measures.
In fact, every crisis is a challenge.
Well, we will learn them.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Who is responsible for this?
Furthermore, what about hours of work?
The first concerns thematic issues.
Welcome
Firstly, Belarus.
Book-burning is alive and well.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Gaza has not changed since then.
Light and justice, nothing else.
That is indeed very disquieting.
We should not let it pass.
That is what we need to answer.
Israel, too, has that right.
You only need to visit the Middle East!
It is beneath any acceptable standard.
Not a word about that.
This is part of a political process.
This cannot carry on.
Europe must not continue to look away.
I believe we most definitely do.
We should ask further questions.
(NL) This report is one-sided.
That is to be welcomed.
This is scandalous!
There are witnesses to this.
We must not turn a blind eye.
The Palestinian people are suffering.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
A dialogue must be mutual.
This is the starting point.
How is this possible?
This one-way street leads nowhere.
Therefore, it started with us.
I would like to ask what we should do.
We, too, should proceed like this.
This is certainly not acceptable.
Let me make my fourth and last point.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Thank you very much.
That is why we debate and discuss.
We have come full circle.
We will do it together.
All of us will be behind you.
I could list many other cases.
Could we be here if we had?
That is a good thing.
The debate is closed.

However, Vilnius is not doing this.
However, dogs are guardian angels.

Those are the criteria that we use.
I ask you.
Are they written down anywhere?
This is what happens.
I will inform you right now.
Mr President, on what grounds?
Chronological order - time order.
On this list, you were number nine.
I shall continue with the sitting.
(Intervention from the floor)
I have explained the criteria.
What else do you want to know?
It is now 10 o'clock in the evening.
This is an absolutely travesty.
Thank you.
I understand your frustration.
That concludes this item.
Written statements (Rule 149)
In fact, it has worsened.
Why are these changes not in force?
Why are they not being applied?
We also need to look to the future.
We need to look at that.
That should not be an issue.
Analyses will also be necessary.
We offer our help in doing this.
The Commission is prepared to do that.
It is currently still with the Council.
The debate is closed.

That is not a view I share.
Mrs Damanaki, we are counting on you.
Most fish stocks are collapsing.
The good are the victims of the bad.
This is remarkable.
Overfishing is an undisputed fact.

The issues are similar.
That is what is needed.

International Women's Day
Is this cause for celebration?
Only 5% of world leaders are women.
Yet this is not just about poverty.

We can still make up for this.

Obesity is a disease, not a problem.
Yes, believe it or not, a referendum.

Is it the travel agent?
Is it the airport or train station?
Updating this law is not enough.
That is an important right in Europe.
That was 20 years ago.
This kind of thing is unacceptable.
Why are we not taking a decision now?
We have already discussed bankruptcies.
Do you share this view?
We should fight this.
We need transparent systems.
Thank you.
Why is it out of date?
Finally, another small problem.
This directive is twenty years old.
The second is prices.
The third is quality.
Thank you very much.
The debate is closed.
Some may say that does not matter.
Are these truly complementary?

This is our first and preferred option.
I cannot believe that.
Take action.
That is what Parliament wishes.
We must bear this in mind.
It is going to be interesting.
If they have, no problem.
What is needed is the political will.
It must be worldwide.
I have an entirely different view.
That is true.
That is not what it is about at all!
That must be paid for another way.
We must be clear.
That is going too far.
That is the right approach.
Should there be earmarking?
I would say yes, but what for?
We must resolve all these matters.
Please give us an answer quickly.
It is a mistake.
It also avoids resolving the issue.
Those that do not matter.
How can all this be controlled?
I doubt the new tax is the right one.
This, as we know, did not materialise.
Thank you.
I have to say that it is not so simple.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Those are the Commission's own words.
That is the fraudster's charter.
That is what I believe.
A deadline presupposes legislation.
We did the same for Visa.
There is an explanation: the cost.
There are two issues involved.
That is our approach to the discussion.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
We should adopt this report.
So, here we are.
Why is this measure important?
We are all in favour of simplification.
What is the outcome of this situation?

Youth unemployment is 20% in the UK.
In France, youth unemployment is 24%.
Micro-entities are often not so tiny.
None!
And look at our tradespeople.
How do you make it work?
There are reasons for this.
I share this fear.
There are various reasons for this.
Thank you.
I have spoken with many micro-entities.
I would like to restate my conviction.
I have noted your reasonable remarks.
Let us not wait.
We need time for that.
I have six basic comments.
All the others are in favour.

It is all about people.
This will be our working practice.
European solutions are needed.
The situation in France is far worse.
This is the wrong approach.
That is not the case.
Not any kind of consumption, however.
(The President interrupted the speaker)
This is still lacking at many levels.
It must be a comprehensive review.
We can come back to that, however.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We are Europe.
We also have a few tensions to resolve.
Of course, promotion is not everything.
That is often the case, but not always.
We need better information.
We need continuous information.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you.
That is an impressive statistic.
That must be dealt with.
They must have proper resources.
The second point concerns SOLVIT.

You have not said anything about this.

I hope I succeed.
How is that?
That is new, I think.
The year 2020 is only 10 years away.
That is why we must be practical.
My fear is we cannot do it twice.
That is the thinking.
What is going on in Beijing?
What is going on in Delhi?
What is going on in Washington?
What is going on in the US Congress?
(The President cut off the speaker)
How and when will it be provided?
That is, of course, a key issue.
What would it require?
Of course, nobody should be naive.
That is what we will be looking for.
I am not saying it is going to be easy.
This is not science.
My second question is as follows.
Do you have an opinion on this?
That is not my approach.
I am the politician.
I think that is a very good point.
We should be careful.
I think it is a natural thing.
I understand your point on big cities.
Is it the Heads of State?
Secondly, your paper is remarkable.
That is the thinking behind this paper.
We are dependent upon others.
That is my concern.
We cannot just put it off.

Subject: Road deaths
Drug driving is an increasing problem.
We do, of course, need more.
How?
Which countries score best?
This is a very complex question.
Subject: Daylight Saving Time
People did not like this at all.
It can become more complicated.
Subject: The freedom/security balance
It is imperative that this is included.
Subject: Green Paper on volunteering
Subject: Long-standing minorities
That concludes Question Time.
Today, we need to know many things.
That was the theory.
That is completely the wrong way to go.

I have not heard one yet.
What is he calling for?
He is calling for privatisation.

This applies to quality, too.
I am thinking of the matter of safety.
As for me, I am pleased about this.
I just want to reply to some remarks.

The negotiations must continue.
So why is this, Commissioner?
Will there be criminal sanctions?
Is the EU position to support this?

Parliament means business.
Is there anything more ridiculous?
Do you really believe this will happen?
That is also an unacceptable risk.
What have you done since then?
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

It is a time to be smart and ambitious.
It is that simple, really that simple.
My preference is clear.
We should respond as Europeans.
A huge chance for Europe.
The UN is another key partner.

The Lisbon Treaty gives us that chance.
We cannot say this any longer.
I admire you for taking it on.
We have promised to support you in it.
Thank you for your attention.
This week, we celebrated 8 March.
I look forward to your answers.
There are more general points.
Well, Russia I have already visited.
It does not have a staffing structure.
It is not there yet.
He was inaugurated on Thursday.
It is not the same.
I have one more comment to add.
We want this External Action Service.
It must be successful.
We hope for positive collaboration.
(Applause)
We are saying this very plainly.
That is not acceptable.
A clear line must be drawn.
(Applause)
Allow me to make a third comment.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is a dangerous development.
Such a view is cynical and inhuman.
I am, too.
(Applause)
Division makes us weak in their eyes.
I would like you to tell me that.
That is only partially true.
Now you seem to have changed your mind.

You have not answered that question.
She has three hats.
Our reports refer to the old times.
You can count on us.
I wish to raise four points:
Thank you.
It really is not.
Thank you.




Now for two points.
Europe needs you to be successful.
I will concentrate on two areas.
However, they have not stopped it.
All they did was delay it.
We need to take that forward.
It is simply that we have a clash.
I must obey and be present at that.
That is very much understood.
I agree too on the cyber threats.
This is a very important issue.
It is here now.
There are no favourites here.
It is on merit.
A couple of final points.
I cannot go to all of them.
There are simply too many.
I will be at some.
I will change sides.
(Applause)
Let us not forget that.
(Applause)
That concludes this item.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
We have some hard work ahead of us.
Let us change this.

Oral explanations of vote
Now to the matter in hand.
Thank you so much, Mr Uspaskich.
I have cut you off.
This is why we voted against.
That is, something that is not true.
I would like to comment on one point.
They have been stripped of all context.
Mistakes were made.
The opposite is the case, in fact.
It has our support in those efforts.
This is not true.
Certainly not!
We do not need a financial tax.
Shame on them.
Written explanations of vote
This measure is thus inappropriate.
I welcome the decision adopted today.
I voted for this resolution.
We shall vote against this text.
The carrot and the stick.
I abstained.
Unfortunately, this has not happened.
The resolution was unanimously adopted.
We are now awaiting a response.
We must show the way.
That is why we abstained.
This is considerable progress.
That is why we voted in favour.
The report calls for:

Europe is divided on this issue.
No other major changes were voted.
I have voted against the report.
EU policy on Arctic issues (debate)
You mentioned a number of key words.
But thank you for the start.
On the one hand, we are concerned.
A number of them have been mentioned.
We live there.
However, we already know all this.
It speeds up climate change.
That is certainly true.
This is undoubtedly true.
Most urgent in my view is the Arctic.
I wish you some idealism in your work.
This proposition is entirely bizarre.
And, by the way...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(Interjection from the floor)
Your speaking time has finished.
(Interjection from the floor)
We shall now move to the next speaker.
Fishing, too, has been mentioned.
Responsible - I stress this.
Thank you.
We need cooperation, not confrontation.
I wish to make two more points.
It will be my third trip there.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
A spectre is hovering over the Arctic.
The spectre of global warming.
Cuba (debate)
Firstly, there is political dialogue.
(Applause)
Let us be very honest.
This is part of the agreement.
I therefore appeal to you.
Is this being condemned?
No!
We will not be part of this hypocrisy.
Why is this?
(Applause)
And why?
Zapata's death is no isolated incident.
What fate awaits him?
They never require imprisonment.
This should be our commitment.
It is, of course, the same commitment.

Besides, it is in their interest.
Which path will Havana choose?
The key to this is to be found in Cuba.
(PL) Liberty will triumph in Cuba.
The same applies to Cuba.
Now we have 27 Member States.
The situation in the world has changed.
There have been no changes or reforms.
I will conclude with two points.
This is obvious.
Can anyone really say that?
The judgment of history is clear.
The ruins of the homeland are safe.
Do not worry comrades.
Now we are going.
It is important to make this point.
This death must not be in vain.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.

That is the effect.
Subject: Domestic violence
Thank you for talking about pensioners.
(HU) I have only one question.
Your Spanish is impressive, Mr Hannan.
Question 6 has been withdrawn.
Subject: EU-Russia visa regime
These are the biggest deficiencies.
That concludes Question Time.

We should not now lower this ambition.
The world's population is growing.
We must do better.
Substantial investment is also needed.
It should publish this.
That could be very lengthy.
This is the situation we must alter.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I am referring to the EU 2020 strategy.
Thank you.
I just want to make two points.
So these, then, are the sources.
Thank you.
What are the time frames?
Thank you.
Let me start with a short story.
This was a very serious piece of work.
If you add that up, it comes to 75.
I have to be fair.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 149)
The stakes are not negligible.
One such country is Poland.
That means before 9 May.
This is damage on a significant scale.

Thank you.

Thank you.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 149)



Why instead of her?
It is pretty clear and obvious.

We have all been moved by their plight.
These are truly worthy aspirations.
Which is the right direction?
The fallout is there.
The consequences are there.
The statistics are there.
That is a natural disaster in itself.

Welcome
They are with us at our sitting.
Please welcome them.
(Applause)
Once again, I warmly welcome you all.
We have challenging tasks ahead of us.
I will come back to this again later.
We need to keep this top of our agenda.
Solidarity is a two-way street.
The world economy needs stability.
That is the European way to do it.
(Applause)
Can this continue?
I do not think so.
(Applause)
That is the first point.
(Applause)
That is not the objective.
Interest rates are usually 2.5 to 3%.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Why not?
That is not the right way to go.
(Applause)
I shall go further, Mr President.
That is my feeling today.
(Applause)
It is not about that.
(Applause)
That is why Europe must intervene.
That is what we must hope for.
I think it is disgraceful.
(Applause)
What will we do then?
It is not yet too late.
Germany is in a decisive position.
EU 2020 is miles away from this.
It is the economy - yes, it is.
I realise that.
That is why I said what I said before.
We have achieved the euro.
No.
The 'Wall' street fell.
What else does it involve?
What does that mean in practice?
It is a recipe for disaster.
That can be avoided.
We have to avoid it.
(LV) Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you.
I should like to make two proposals:
How much of the Structural Funds?
That is the right path to take.
Not the others.
That is just an excuse.
(Applause)
That is the crucial thing.
We need a carrot and stick approach.
Nevertheless, we have a problem.
I heard Mr Langen interpret the treaty.
Madam President, two things.
Now we see the results.
We have seen the results.
No, she did not understand it at all.
There is no meat in it.
Greece consumed it.
I have one more thought.
We must act swiftly to help Greece.
He was right.
Surely Greece will be threatened today.
So let us not shoot Greece down.
Thank you for your attention.
That is incredible.
It is rapidly failing.
It is their case.
It is their cause.
The rollercoaster will start.
It is the problem.
It is truly imprisoned in the eurozone.
Join it at your peril.
The time has come for a decision.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The EU has credibility and liquidity.
It is even a matter of duty.
Greece is not begging.
Very clear.
I know that they will.
What were the major conclusions?
Be flexible, please!
This is by way of encouragement.
Why should we avoid the issue?
Are they mutually inclusive principles?
You did an excellent job.
Let us continue.
This does not compromise our rights.
I think it is not just a fig leaf.
Think about it.
For me, this is the key issue.
Many thanks for that.
(DE) I will now continue in German.
This is where the problems arise.
I would like to go a step further.
I think not.
And why not?
That is an important consideration.
Mr Kamall is not here...
We all agree on practicality.
We have also to bear this in mind.
The item is hereby closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Situation in Tibet (debate)
We respect the 'one China' policy.
We must not give up.
This is not true.
There must be no repeat of this.
Despite this, the claims persist.
This week, Google has abandoned China.
This is sad, indeed.
This is embarrassing.
Was that a joke?
Sadly, this is not the case.
The global public cannot remain silent.
Let us do this.
Let us do it now.
We must also be clear in this respect.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Thank you for your attention.
That will clearly not be possible.
I hope that you understand that.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Greece's problem is mainly political.
...
They will not flinch.
However, these measures must continue.
(The President cut off the speaker)
And why is that?
Because it has many faults.
That concludes this item.
The next item is the joint debate on:
Why else is 2011 so special?
The margins are very small.
What is important is implementation.
We are committed to seeing that it is.
So are those reserves or not?
How are we to implement it?
Many of them are fairly well educated.
They only lack job opportunities.
(The President cut off the speaker)
What is our problem?
Otherwise, there is no greater waste.
It should not be a unilateral decision.
I am counting on you.
To you, it is a budget.
They represent our suggestions.
Parliament should be taking a lead.
I now turn to Parliament's budget.
I have one further request.
My second point is about savings.
Thirdly, how is the money used?
I think we need courage.
Yes, that was low-level in 2009-2010.
I can only share this conclusion.
The fifth ought to be decidedly better.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Work on the 2011 budget is under way.
That is my intention, in any case.
First, the joint European Union logo.
The fourth element: the organic logo.
On this there is complete agreement.
It is surely a decision for consumers.
Otherwise, it is worthless.
I am an egg producer.
That is essential.
Now present us with a good text.
Do so quickly; we have faith in you.
I can recommend it to you all.
The same applies to the size of pizzas.
This leads to unfair competition.
We are thus in a right old stew!
You are right about that.
I would like to address two points.
Take China, for example.
Thank you for your attention.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.

Statements by the President
This is something to build upon.
We must strengthen that accountability.
(The President cut off the speaker)
It is a union of shared destiny.
Let me conclude.
Today, the worst may be over.
This crisis is far from behind us.
Those who do best cannot be penalised.
Where are we?
Of course.
What does that mean?
I mean, how come?
We need more integration.
Germany realises this.
That is preposterous!
This is what we are calling for.
(The President cut off the speaker)
On 25 March 1821, Greece was born.
Thank you, sir.
Your time has run out.
But this has been tried, of course.
(Applause)
That is turning the world on its head.
If not, should you not have known that?
It has been at 30-40% for years.
Nothing to do with the crisis at all.
A complete disaster.
It is already failing.
Just look at some economic basics.
There is no lender.
Far too many of us.
We need a more automated system.
This could be the result of the summit.
They have to export their goods.
That is not sufficient.
This is not a true European policy.
(Applause)
The deficit is still extremely large.
Only two are in euroland.
Does this mean we are lazy?
There is a certain contradiction here.
We should avoid such inconsistency.
The signs were there.
Global imbalances need to be corrected.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The pact's main aim was prevention.
Thank you.
Quite clearly, I am sorry to hear this.
This is what we must take into account.
This is the magic panacea that we need.
But for how much longer?
Unemployment has risen above 13%.
We are not over the difficult times.
We have to remain extremely alert.
I fully agree with that.
This is a key issue.
I want to stress that.
You can trust us.
We can prove that.
This is not theory.
These are facts; these are figures.
We are a college.
The debate is closed.

ECB annual report for 2008 (
Voting time (continued)
Explanations of vote
This is unacceptable.
That is a fact.
I disagree with that.
The contrary is true.
Why?
There should be a clear divide.
We have done a good job.
That was my first point.
I am sure you will remember this.
Show me the tribute money'.
And they brought unto him a penny.
They say unto him: 'Caesar's'.
It is an irrelevant report.
No, what did we go and do just now?
Written explanations of vote
We Greens agree with the procedure.

A CCCTB is not about a common tax rate.
Mr Const√¢ncio has an impressive CV.
It sets a serious precedent.
This was no ordinary vote.
This is wrong.
The past is not dead.
Public office would lose dignity.
It operates with complete independence.
Generic 'integration' is not enough.
This problem is often neglected.
I did, of course, vote in favour.
That is why I voted in favour.
Citizens have the right to protection.
For this reason, we must protect them.
It is not enough, however.
I voted against.
That is why we voted against it.
Has the ECB fulfilled its role?
It is hard to be sure.
Adjournment of the session
Resumption of the session
Statements by the President
(Applause)
The Minutes have been approved.
You are right, Mr Speroni.
I agree.
This is why I mentioned it.
Thank you very much.
It is fundamental to our existence.
The European Central Bank also agreed.
This discussion is crucial.
Budgetary discipline is not sufficient.
This applies also to economic policy.
We ignore it at our peril.
We will pursue internal work as well.
Let me assure you that I am neither.
The two coming years will be difficult.
It is a prudent safety net.
It may not be perfect.
What about children?
How are you going to treat pensioners?
But we have the right springboard.
This seems promising.
Let us look, primarily, at Greece.
That is down to the Council.
That is not a solution.
The Council must find solutions.
It tears several parts from it.
(Applause)
(Applause)
That is not the way to help Greece.
We need that now.
We need a courageous package.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Is she supposed to go empty-handed?
It is embarrassing!
I have to say, I was not one of them.
It is no package to cover the citizens.
I regard that as a dubious procedure.
Otherwise, I fear the worst.
June this year is much too late.
In fact, all centralised EU plans fail.
You have not been elected.
This debate is a big sham.
Yet what are we seeing now?
Portugal, Spain, Hungary, you name it.
These must be corrected.
We asked Greece to take some measures.
Nevertheless, they must be carried out.
It is convinced of that.
I do not take examples from the past.
We must be far more preventative.
Let us not endanger them!
To each, their own responsibility.
We will assess the situation.
How can all that be improvised?
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Van Rompuy.
It is, therefore, a key issue.
We in the EU can only do so much.
We need to respect the rules we have.
So we know what to do.
What are the instruments, though?
We have known this for years.
Why be so afraid of growth?
This applies to us all.
The plan failed.
I wanted to know your thoughts.
You can read it; I will send it to you.
What that means, no one yet knows.
You have your resit in June.
We need more European solutions.
My second point concerns Europe 2020.
Europe 2020 is not an objective.

What has happened to these intentions?
(HU) I would like to make two remarks.
How could a June adoption be possible?
What has happened?
I thought that was easy to understand.
When will people be told the truth?
This will be quite detailed.
The Treaty of Lisbon is very clear.
Therefore, we must find something.
Why?
There is a great deal of work to do.
The Treaty does not provide for this.
It is the very first time.

We have two days: 5 and 6 May.
It is a serious human rights violation.
Thank you very much.
I have some specific questions.
Thank you for your remark.

(The President cut off the speaker)
Thus, it was not a point of order.
Thank you very much.
That concludes this item.
I think that we should focus on them.
Thank you, Mr Sz√°jer.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
We need to think that one through.
Do we really have a watertight system?
We have seen some examples of that.
I have tried this out for myself.
So here we have a problem then.
I will leave it at that one question.
We also work very much with ICAO.
The debate is closed.
This is unacceptable.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Aviation security charges (debate)
However, we will have to pay for this.
I was targeted a moment ago.
This is typical if you live in Austria.
The far-right wingers sit over there.
Many thanks.
We will now continue with the debate.
She cannot be here today.
We do not want to impose anything.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That also applies to charges.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you for your attention.
What, in the end, is the issue here?
We should therefore not start too high.
That simply should stop.
Transparency is imperative here.
We will see where that debate leads.
This is not only my opinion.
We now have the Treaty of Lisbon.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Thank you.
That is not all, however.
Roads are the arteries of our economy.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That cannot be allowed to happen!
That is his responsibility.
We will manage, nevertheless.
The debate is closed.
We therefore need a dynamic policy.
Let me briefly address three points.
I have a couple of comments, however.
This situation must be ended.
That has become abundantly clear.
We all know how important this area is.
We need new blood.
I strongly endorse such a system.
That is necessary.
That is, ships have to behave well.
Such cooperation seems ideal to me.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)

It has 150 partner organisations.
It must be a joint European project.
We welcome it.

This is important for two reasons.
I thought this would cost thousands.
I am not sure that one can do that.

Animal welfare is an important issue.
I believe we need to change direction.
The 2013 CAP needs to be ambitious.
Farmers cannot manage this alone.

Opening of the sitting
Agenda
They are additional changes.
There will not be a plenary sitting.
Quite a number of matters were decided.
We want to be involved in this.
We are ready for this.
We are open to this.
The rules are good ones.
There is nothing wrong with that model.
We started discussing this yesterday.
Safety is paramount.
We have to take decisive action.
That is what I call on you to ensure.
We must protect their rights.
Both planes narrowly escaped disaster.
Human life is priceless.
We need to give our attention to that.
That is another model.
That is simply not possible.
That would make things a lot simpler.
I find that extraordinary.
There is no pocket-book precaution.
I would like to raise two issues.
The first is related to State aid.
This is not acceptable.
We need a certain amount of reserves.
That is not right, either.
We must deal with this from the centre.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That terrifies me.
The rapporteur is Mr Ferreira.
In my opinion, it all took too long.
We must learn from this.
This situation must improve.
Repatriating them must be our priority.
Thirdly, the question of passengers.
Could action have been taken sooner?
Could it have been taken earlier?
This requires answers.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Let us therefore be consistent.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We need a safety net.
We are told that we need more Europe.
(The President cut off the speaker)
A potential influenza epidemic?
An erupting volcano?
Therefore, action was taken.
We are being far too polite.
I have four additional ones to make.
This is a very serious issue.
However, we should be careful.
There can be no miracle.
They are good.
The question is a very different one.
Well, I was active all the time.
I was at Eurocontrol.
I was in contact with ministers.
This was mentioned here as well.
This is a big opportunity.
That is the picture.
The case is not closed.
Thank you for your remarks.
It is the most important topic.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
We should use our imagination.
Thank you very much.
This possibility must be avoided.
Thank you very much for this.
I find that very sad.
We need more investment.
We cannot tolerate this.
This is not acceptable.
We will have to work on this.
We also support energy taxation.
There is still a lot to do.
That approach was wrong and it failed.
We do not, of course, like everything.
Why, though, is it time to act?
I will give you an example.
Is that another joke?
That is a recipe for more unemployment.
Ask the European public.
We need greater ambition in Europe.
I am in favour of subsidiarity.
That is unbelievable!
It is all really rather extraordinary.
(Applause)
Let us show some common sense!
(Applause)
The Commission has worked very hard.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Two aspects stand out, in particular.
There are three points I want to raise.

It was truly heartbreaking.
Keep working towards that goal.
What should be done, then?
So, congratulations!
You have confirmed that yourselves.
It is possible.
I want to address the issue of shelter.
We are working on property rights.
That is one of the risk elements.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
These are very optimistic sums.
Let us do more to make up for this now.
What is your view on this approach?
I want to underline this.
It is not.
It is a coordination of loans.
Therefore, I will repeat it.
My question is slightly different.
Let us be clear about that.
You could at least say so publicly.
We shall do it.
That is what we are going to do.
I have one question.
He is not changing anything.
Let us be honest and open about it.
We need a proper level of regulation.
That is my question.
I apologise for that word.
Would you agree?
We are not there.
That will be self-defeating for us.
Let us be completely clear about it.
That is our priority now.
Two of them I have already mentioned.
I underline the word investment.
It was no longer possible for me to go.
This is our intention.
You should provide examples.
That is the only way to do it.
Can we not bring about such a strategy?
There is a lot to do in this area.
They have not done so.
How do you assess the programme?
That is not true.
What is the Commission intending to do?
I think it was interesting.
They strengthen our relationship.
I will continue in English.
It is very comprehensive.
There is nevertheless one exception.
I would like an answer please.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The Falklands Islands were raised.
The debate is closed.

Kyrgyzstan (debate)
However, indicators are not enough.
We need real proof.
Two reasons can, of course, be given.
We are not in Haiti, but in Kyrgyzstan.
It is very important.
We need to look again very carefully.
He has just come back.

The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
EU - Canada Summit (debate)
So it is an important relationship.
The timing is fortunate.
The summit will cover climate change.
This is still in force but outdated.
This is not all about provoking Canada.
They will need to be vigilant.
This issue must continue to be raised.
This is the principle of solidarity.
He is determined to make a change.
This should be enforced in Canada.
All I would add to that are two things.
That is what it is for.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Question Time (Commission)
Part one:
That is the stage we are at.
Why?
This is the stage we are at.
Part two:
This is a sad role.
It sounds extremely interesting.
I would like to hear more about it.
I am trying to reach a conclusion.
Subject: EU broadband strategy
It was a bit under 50%.
Sweden does not have an opt-out clause.
Can such an agreement be legal?
Thank you for the answer.
I would ask for your opinion on this.
Subject: Budget deficit in Cyprus
That is a real problem for me.
I have no time and cannot stay.
I have a lot of engagements as well.
You have to say that to the President.
It is not up to me.
You are right to point out the problem.
There is only the common currency.
Subject: European Monetary Fund
What is the status of this proposal?
Are we talking a year, 18 months?
So, what did we achieve?
What is preventing it?
That is the decision of the UK people.
It is not just another agency.
I am going to close the debate.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Here is just one example.
What is the aim of these amendments?
What can be done?
The proposal is a compromise.
Too much time has already been wasted.
However, I must speak openly.
I would have liked to see more.
I must take note of that myself.
That would be a very positive step.
Can you answer that?
We live in the age of globalisation.
We will indeed use them very properly.
(Applause)
We will not decide until May.
That is unacceptable.
One less excuse for whom?
(The President cut off the speaker)
I am pleased about this.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is the aim of this report.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
I welcome this pragmatic approach.
We need to stabilise prices.
This is important.
Can you give us some details of these?
Thank you very much.
We need to give them answers now.
We are in agreement on this.
We must provide rules.
There are four theoretical options.
The third is the stock market option.
We cannot continue with such a policy.
That represents a reduction of 24%.
In contrast, mixed livestock farms ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
We are in agreement on that.
The debate is only just beginning.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
This has to change.

2008 Discharge (debate)
We have already decided about that.
We also know our respective positions.
Finally, to external policy actions.
We are, however, making some progress.
A great deal of money is involved.
We should be alert to this.
Nevertheless, my report is critical.
I have discussed a number of concerns.
We must keep to the allotted time.
I have some information.
That is what I would suggest.
Once again, I find this regrettable.
That is a problem for us.
We cannot go on as we have up to now.
The list could go on.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I am sorry for these points of order.
This is the reason for the long debate.
What could the problem be here?
We want answers to these questions.
How can this be prevented?
I should like to raise a few issues.
This is most encouraging.
However, a great deal needs to be done.
Is this acceptable?
We know all the excuses.
Let me give a specific example.
Why are you doing this?
What is all this travel money spent on?
Which countries are benefiting from it?
That is simply not good enough.
Of course not.
This is about their money.

We shall see.
11) The principle of subsidiarity.
So, the solutions are on the table.
That is what Mr Gerbrandy said.
Thank you Minister.


The fact is, we do not have a clue.
I have read and reread that statement.
The deadlines have to be shortened.
Thank you very much, Mrs Weiler.
Many happy returns!
We want 100% of the money back.
I would like to thank you for coming.
We could re-table them, but why?
Nothing should be more obvious.
What have they done?
We should be clearer about this.
This title is very apt.
There are obviously still shortcomings.
That is a good thing.
That is, of course, a good thing.
I would like to reject that suspicion.
We all know what that means.
The third time it has been harder.
That is my basic position.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
I should like to give two examples.
Has this solved all the problems?
Absolutely not.
Significant improvement, I would say.
SWIFT (debate)
Third parties will not get bulk data.
There will be reciprocity.
But we also need to be realistic here.
Reciprocity is part of the mandate.
It is not part of the negotiations.
It needs to be faced.
Quality must come before timeframe.
How can that work?
In the United States?
Or are there other proposals?
Please enlighten me here.
Reasonable suspicion cannot be enough.
This tenet must be amended.
I should like to hear your responses.
The focus should only be on terrorism.
However, what can we ask for in return?
Let us trust our US partners.
I would call it common sense.
It is not about that.

There will be an EU review team.
The rest will remain anonymous.
That is a very important discussion.
So this is a parallel discussion.
So please be understanding about this.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Passenger Name Record (PNR) (debate)
I think that is a wise strategy.


That is quite clear.
That is a crucial question.
This can be discussed.
That was in February.
This is really the key to everything.
Great!
Something needs to be done about this.
I have no quarrel with that.
I think that is a false dilemma.
Hopefully, we will have good results.
I have read your resolution.
The debate is closed.
Is this a worthy goal?
Yes, it is.
Clearly it is.
Unfortunately, there are.

Why?
Technology is also significant there.
Here, there is high technology, I know.


Why?
Why has there been this long silence?
And why now?
Why a debate now?
I find the whole matter unjustified.
I know it really well.
That was a translation error.
We share your concerns about cyanide.
Thank you for this debate.
The debate is closed.

Œ§he next item is the vote.
Explanations of vote
It is also markedly technical.
I have therefore rejected the proposal.
These include:
It was adopted by a large majority.
I do not agree with the latter point.
I have therefore abstained from voting.
These are all essential issues.
I support the entire report.
They have the local knowledge.
in writing. - I voted for this report.
Let us contribute to these proposals.
That is why we abstained.
I completely oppose it.
That is very much to be welcomed.
This is clearly simply assumed.
I shall vote in favour of this text.
Terrorist acts do occur.
They must be combated.
I therefore voted for this amendment.
This is highlighted by this resolution.
Cyanide technology is just one of them.
Statements by the President
Der Sommer war sehr gro√ü...'.
We called that the Community method.
Firstly, we are revising the Treaty.
This is no light matter.
There is no need on this occasion.
It is the citizens who do the electing.
I think this is a very bad development.
I see no need to convene a convention.
It was not easy.
I would like to thank him for this.
I agree.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
I am referring to the human element.
Clear steps forward have been taken.
We need quality in public finances.
I will come back to this in a moment.
We are all competing on world markets.
We cannot have a standstill.
Psychology also matters in markets.
That is what we must urgently correct.
This work must be speeded up.
I do not think so.
What will become of our euro?
Thank you for your attention.
I promise you will be able to speak.
We have no other instrument.
Why?
It is clear that we have made mistakes.
They should say: 'We are to blame!
It is us!
It is our fault!'
That is my first point.
You are completely crazy.
That is unacceptable!
Besides, Europe can take initiatives.
The Treaties must be amended.
We can do it; yes, we can.
Let us do it.
I have one last point.
Let them disarm.
That comes to almost EUR 3 billion.
They come to EUR 1 billion.
Yet this is completely hypocritical.
Let us know!
Germany has 200 000.
Let us put that to Greece.
(Applause)
Who would not want that?
This has been absent in recent years.
The workers, ordinary citizens?
I believe that is right.
Mr President, thank you very much.
These are dangerous times.
They say solidarity is needed.
You should be thoroughly ashamed.
(EL) Mr President, thank you.
There is absolutely no excuse for this.
They did not kill anyone.
It is a huge responsibility.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Let me touch briefly on most of them.
I think this is progress.
This really cannot continue.
You can count on our support.
There is no time to lose.
Is that change, though, Mr Barroso?
We cannot ignore it.
This is not our vision of the future.
This is not the time.
Let me make a comparison.
That is the comparison we have to make.
Let me take some examples.
Most of it is not enforced.
Now they are paying the price.
Mrs Ek mentioned some specific areas.
The EU is already crumbling.
That is a rather low level from him.
We see the situation in the world.
However, crises can spread.
What do you say in Europe then?
That is true.
That is precisely what happened.
That is not a criticism, either.
The standard cannot be the crisis!
Will we be more supportive?
First of all: choose democracy.
Secondly: work has to be paid work.
Thirdly: choose sound public spending.
Fifthly: choose poverty reduction.
(EL) Mr President, thank you very much.
(Applause)
Is this the Europe we want for 2020?
It was not better, however.
Why is this?
Europe 2020 is not our goal.
And we are still in the same position.
That has been completely lost.
The biodiversity strategy has failed.
Unemployment is constantly rising.
Then they will see the differences.
That is a sensible thing to do.
It is all about this debate.
Our education systems are different.
(The President cut off the speaker)
2020 is based on 2010.
Think about it and act now.
(DE) Thank you very much Mr President.
We have seen problems in Greece.
There is no question of sustainability.
Others have also referred to it.
Why did the Lisbon Strategy fail?
That step has not been taken.
That is not all.
In conclusion, I count on your support.
Why so?
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Its potential is far greater.
The sitting is resumed.
In many cases it goes beyond.
I just want to mention two of them.
This is what we are going to adopt now.
We can all be pleased about that.
It is a very important step.
Why do we need it?
So finally, thanks to you, we have it.
There is no problem.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Which area is covered by accession?
Electric cars (debate)
We must not lag behind in this regard.
The area of land used alone is immense.
It is currently 117 hectares a day.
I am not an environmental extremist.
Nothing much has changed since then.
First of all, the employees themselves.
I stress this particular issue to you.
Thirdly, the charging infrastructure.
It is not too late to avoid that.
The technology will choose itself.
We have said 'yes' to a German plug.
I have two more points.
Let me explain myself better.
One is technology and the other energy.
It is working now.
I believe that Europe has a strategy.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Green cars offer significant benefits.
What did the Spanish Presidency do?
Did it really support the European bid?
This cannot be right.
Tough love does work.

(LV) Thank you, Mr President.
This is extremely important.
Thank you.
They are right.
We can also do much more in Parliament.
(BG) Thank you, Mr President.
That concludes this item.
The next item is the debate on:
This Regulation was adopted in 2002.
What do we have now?
I think you need to look at this.
We now have Mr Tajani's paper.
To do so would be intrusive.
This should be continually monitored.
It is an absolutely essential process.
Let us talk about it, then!
We want more competition.
We need a strong distribution system.
Competition must work.
All that is improved.
It has been mostly the latter.
That is the truth of it.
That is what we wish to rectify.
I therefore share your concerns.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 149)
I sincerely hope that it will.

I would like to know: is this the case?

It is not a precedent for the future.

This is a step in the right direction.
There is just one amendment.

Why?
Stockholm Action Plan (debate)
It is a new era.
There are two other important issues.
We really are waiting for it.
We must define some priorities.
Whatever happened to solidarity?
We may be building time bombs.
There is no third pillar any more.
There is an awful lot in the pipeline.
You know what is my bible?
I need your very constructive help.
It is going to be on your table.

Question Time (Commission)
Part one
I think that is unfair.
Subject: The EU's State aid map
It is unbelievable.
Part two
Subject: EU-Ukraine police cooperation
We are open to cooperation with them.
They are an important neighbour.
We have lots in common.
I thank the Commissioner for her reply.
Subject: A common EU visa policy
Bearing in mind:
Since then, there has been progress.
I understand that.
Subject: Entrepreneurs and SMEs

Subject: SMEs
Subject: SMEs and job creation
Subject: European SME Week
Next week is the European SME week.
Will Question 33, in Part 3, be taken?
How do you win an election?
One vote at a time.
It will return a dividend.
That concludes Question Time.
The sitting is resumed.
I will now quote from the statement.
That is the quotation.
This 10% is very small.
How can we calculate their incomes?
The result of that is ghettoisation.
The debate is closed.
Commissioner Georgieva was also there.
Inevitably, man is also affected.
The latter raises three major issues.
Is it not time that we did so?
Let us be certain as to what happened.
What does that mean?
You spoke about good coordination.
We should not allow this to happen.
However, nature has its own demands.
Was it the technology that failed?
Was it human error?
We have put the relevant questions.
I have one final point to make.
That is how we work in the Commission.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
These are still too general in nature.
Volcanic ash crisis (debate)
They are excellent measures.
Can we obtain an assessment of this?
The first is the Single European Sky.
What other measurements do they take?
What else do you think that we can do?
Quite how, then, is this to be solved?
Who, exactly, is to be compensated?
The airlines?
Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you.
Firstly, there were the passengers.
I now come to the airlines.
The other victim has been tourism.
We need to know.
That would surely be absurd.
This is, of course, a significant loss.
This will be a very complicated thing.
This is a very clear message.
This is a different word.
This is another interesting story.
The debate is closed.

The next item is:
That is the situation.
Why is this important?
Yes, we need to avoid moral hazards.
It is better to be safe than sorry.
Well let us do it now!
We must learn lessons from all this.
This cannot continue either.
My group is asking Europe to wake up.
The system is wrong.
Let me put this in practical terms.
This is a warped system.
Now it is the governments' turn.
They must be controlled and regulated.
(Protests)
That is a good thing.
I am really sorry.
This represents a huge risk.
(Applause)
In my opinion, this is much too late.
That is what must be done.
(Applause)
This is nothing new for my group.
I would like to make one final point.
(Applause)
This approach misses the point.
What we are lacking is a social union.
Please keep to your time next time.
Could you explain why this is?
We do not want any farm to burn down.
We must also look at the budget.
Yes, we need to balance our budgets.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We had the Stability Pact.
He said the Stability Pact was stupid.
So we had to change it.
This was the guardian of the treaties.
No, it makes things even worse.
I understand the German taxpayers.
So what is he trying to prove?
We need true solidarity ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Just one example of this is Eurostat.
Who blocked this move?
(The President cut off the speaker)
I will make a deal with you.
Greece will be no different.
You did not do so.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Where are the concrete proposals?
That is simply not enough.
That is the cause of this crisis.
I think this is irresponsible.
Do not put your name to this mockery.
We also need financial supervision.
Be ambitious!
You have our support.
This is urgently needed.
This may well be our last chance.
Global governance is being established.
What influence will Europeans have?
And what is happening now?
Growth means investment.
We must face the facts.
This crisis does not remain static.
It is not only a crisis of the euro.
Why are we in this situation?
But are our markets free?
Of course that must happen.
The crisis has continued.
Unacceptable deficits have been run up.
We need financial stability.
We need to learn from this adversity.
We know that - history has taught us.
Noli me tangere - touch me not!
Take a look at Asia, Commissioner.
(The President interrupted the speaker)
We have to appreciate them dearly.
Otherwise, it will go badly.
I am sorry to interrupt you.
We need a vision of a market economy.
We must now bring it to life.
The answer is 'no'.
Where was the Commission?
The first aspect is solidarity.
We cannot wait much longer for this.
We have to work on three strengths.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The Commissioner has the floor.
We do not have the luxury of time.
Instead, we must act without delay.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
It does not, however, go far enough.
The content is limited and pessimistic.
We need concrete measures.
The young need jobs, not promises.

This amendment makes very good sense.
How is this?
We have to close the gap.
Let our surgeons do their work.
Let our patients be treated.
This is the gift of life.
Why should we ban thrombin?
Where will it end?
It is pure populism.
What is the evidence?
What is thrombin?
Thrombin is a natural enzyme.
Today, we had to vote on glued meat.
I respect public opinion of this kind.
That is not the case.
We do not want glued meat in Europe.
One final remark about glued ham.
Written explanations of vote
I supported this important report.
I voted for this report.
That is why I voted as I did.
I therefore supported this report.
That is why I voted as I did.
I voted in favour.
To do that, resources are needed.
2.

4.
That is why I voted as I did.
The text has no valid scientific basis.
Thrombin is currently in use.
After today, it will not be permitted.
There is a difference.
That is why I voted as I did.
I voted in favour of it, nonetheless.
This is a victory for consumers.
This is highly deceptive.
The figures speak for themselves.
Every day, 12 of them die.
That is why I voted as I did.
I therefore voted in favour.
I welcome this development.
This needs to change.
Therefore, I voted in favour.
This is indeed a very coherent package.
What have we laid down?

(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)

This is not all doom and gloom.
We must restore confidence.
Europe cannot be left behind.
Europe needs a forward-looking Union.
And here I have some question marks.
An inclusive society needs more jobs.
What are your proposals?
You are not entitled to stay silent.
They will get the benefits.
No, Sir.
These are our strong points.
These are our hopes.
What determines our growth?
By 2020, the gap will be unbridgeable.
We need true European solidarity.
Instead they are moving backwards.
That is what the real debate is about.
That is how we will make progress.
Small enterprises are crucial.
What is needed then?
We do not say this often enough.
We must meet their expectations.
That is exactly what we need.
It is not the whole story, though.
That was my first point.
This is the ultimate European paradox.
We need to do something about this.
What are the prospects for 2020?
Proposals have been made.
That must be one of our objectives.
Many such cuts would affect education.
Each case merits individual attention.
That will not achieve anything.
In fact, we have been consumed by it.
We need to clarify certain points.
Enough talk.
That is the point of my speech.
Keep it simple.
I am not implying anything of the sort.
Let us not be dogmatic.
This is not a Greek crisis.
So now what is everybody saying?
That the market must be reassured.
Who is the market, though?
Investing in it bears no risk.
To agriculture!
Why not?
The EU 2020 strategy can be different.
This is a situation we cannot accept.
What does this mean in concrete terms?
How?
That will not be smart or intelligent.
Will there be inflation?
(LV) Thank you, Mr President.
I have a dog at home.
Who is to blame for this?
Thank you.
Now it is time to save.
This is one of the main problems.
That has to be our starting point.
'Softly, softly' will not do anymore.
We have to up our game.
This is the problem with strategies.
(Applause)
A top-down Europe cannot work.
Now, that is a contradiction.

It has a dual objective.
These are all very important elements.
The whole thing is far too flat.
I ask you to acknowledge this.
The item is closed.

University Business Dialogue (debate)

He has the support of my group.

(The President cut off the speaker)
This report is truly bonkers!
The political aspect is blocked.
Thank you for your understanding.
That is the acid test.
Standing still cannot be an option.
Let me just apologise for the Council.
Thank you, I will do that.
I will do that.
Thank you very much.
Colleagues, please keep to your time.
Let us reassert these words.
I shall come to that in a second.


I shall make five very short remarks.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
This is a very important subject.
All of these things remain relevant.
We must remember this.
A second matter is that of visas.
Thank you.
Mr Posselt spoke about this.
Thank you very much.
For that we need a strategy.
I wish to emphasise two points.
This will give the Caucasus a key role.
I just want to say one thing.
We should apply the same principles.

Written explanations of vote
Today, it is a crisis factor in itself.
That is why I voted as I did.
I wish him all the best.
That is why I voted as I did.
That is why I voted as I did.
The Greek crisis has proven that.
Our boat is taking on water.
I am voting against this report.
We supported his approach.
However, its virtue ends there.
I am voting against this report.
In fact, I bow down deeply before her.
1.
Religious freedom in Pakistan
Much, therefore, remains to be done.
Let us want something!
We are only meant to have two minutes.
I am going to take four speakers.
Nevertheless, something must be done.
Thank you very much.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.
Written statements (Rule 149)
These efforts must be encouraged.

We must now return to it.
What were the 'red-shirts' demanding?
He has remained strangely silent.
We will not vote in favour of it.

This injustice must stop.

I hope Parliament will do the same.
There is also good news there.
I have been there many times.
Civil society has been active.

I very much welcome that fact.
We need the opportunity to speak out.
Mr Mann, I understand your frustration.

I would like to add one more thing.
Today's debate is not on road safety.
That was not a point of order.
This is a fact.
We do not think so.
I would like to dispel two myths.
We should bury this myth.
That is the heart of the matter.
The vote in committee was clear.
It is not true.
That is correct.
That is only right.
That should be taken into account.
Let us abandon this nonsense.
This is about fair competition.
It is not a road safety issue.
I want to thank you for that.
(Applause)
It puts other road users at risk.
Why would we do that?
This is not a matter of road safety.
It is time to act at last.
We must not confuse these two things.
From whom?
I represent Northern Ireland.
It is right on the edge of Europe.

Food information to consumers (debate)

Information must be legible.
Information must be understandable.
I hope that we can stop them.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you for your attention.
We do not yet have this.
It is something that we all want.
Please support my proposals.
That is disgraceful.
I hope they receive support.
We now have a chance to rectify this.
I, too, support that.
We are told that 'it is complicated'.
We are told that 'it is a ban'.
So let us not give way!
Let me make one thing very clear.
This is a process, a first reading.
Indeed it is.
It is.
One is country of origin.
I have a number of points to make.
Labels will not reduce obesity.
I am glad this is a first reading.
The traffic lights are misleading.
That is perfectly clear.
In other words, we are what we eat.
We must also focus on intelligibility.
We must also focus on objectivity.
Allow me to raise two points.
This is an ongoing process.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
What does the European Parliament want?
We do not think so.
We must correct these flaws, and fast.
Rather, the problem must be rooted out.

We are going to vote electronically.
So everything is straightforward.
On my screen, I have the name T≈ëk√©s.
Is that correct?
(Heckling in agreement)
Is that right?

So it is not at all clear.
The matter is clear.
Now I will answer three more questions.
Can you not arrange it?
Anything else makes no difference.
It is different to other votes.

I declare the vote open.
(RO) My card did not work.
I am voting against.

Thank you for your indulgence.

We, the Verts/ALE Group, supported it.

I have therefore abstained from voting.
I welcome this.
My constituents deserve better.
That is why I voted as I did.
I am voting against this damaging text.
That is why I voted as I did.
That is why I voted as I did.
To this extent, it is a formal act.
This is scandalous.
This is not a serious approach.
However, there are also positive signs.
Thank you.
That is why I voted as I did.
I voted in favour of this report.

Further moral hazard.
Above all, this is a question of will.
More needs to be done.
I disagree with this approach.
It simply had to be adopted!
I therefore voted against this report.
I shall therefore abstain.
I therefore rejected the report.
We must not trivialise it.
Did Mrs Malmstr√∂m explain this to you?
If so, how could you have decided this?
It did not answer my question, however.
She is perfectly aware of that.
I can tell you this now.
I also agree with your first statement.
Just read Article 136.
That would be a fundamental mistake.
Firstly, we have legislation.
That is, frankly, important.
There are two basic issues here.
I want to underline that point.
It is for our security as well.
What do you have in mind?
It is critically important.
That is not the problem.
This is the right point.
It is about reform.
How can we do this?
Credit rating agencies (debate)
The next item is the debate on:


We are not there yet.
This is the stage we are at.
It is not enough.




There are only a few serious providers.
He who pays the piper calls the tune.
It inevitably led to misgrading.
They exposed Enron, for example.
Kaput is kaput in any language!
So what does this House propose?
The question is, who would these fool?
We do need this investor confidence.
One could cite numerous other examples.

Is it sustainable?
Mr Karas also raised this issue.
Will this legislation be enough?

The debate is closed.
That has been the case.
This satisfies all parties.
Here is the result of our joint work.
We were able to find a balance.
This is a well-balanced proposal.
It is a very welcome precedent.

We must not miss this opportunity.
It is our responsibility.
I am pleased that you share my views.
The debate is closed.
That, at least, is our impression.
Good afternoon.
Thank you Mr Obermayr.
The ball is in the Commission's court.
That could also be a possibility.
Should we not open up this debate?
The answer to both questions is 'no'.
We are going to change the focus.

This is the challenge we face.
Thirdly, we need to innovate.
I do.
I do.
I do.

However we have quantifications.
That is why we have to work together.
The debate is closed (Rule 149).
Question Time (Commission)
Part one
It is indeed a serious question.
I want to make three points on this.

I could continue the list.
Is it reliable?
These are now working.
This is up and running.
I have just one or two brief questions.
What will happen to these buildings?

What can we do about this?
Part two
You would describe it as outreach work.
Subject: Dealing with EDC mixtures
I have just one supplementary.
In total, it cost almost EUR 1 billion.
This is what we are guaranteeing.
Mr President, I will be very brief.
Is there a reason for this?
What about Commissioner Dalli?
Do we lose him entirely?
In fact, two Commissioners.
It happens every single time.
I am going to take one final question.
Subject: Birds and Habitats Directives
That concludes Question Time.
The next item is the joint debate on:

We have had enough of good intentions.
My thanks to everyone involved.
This requires an urgent response.
Thank you very much.
However, it must not stop at a debate.
We are accountable to our voters.
No one will be impressed by mere words.
We cannot do this alone.
It is more important what happens next.
Good evening, Mr President.
That would be a mistake.
That is one thing.
Here we come to the implementation.
How did we come up with these ideas?
First, Mr Romeva i Rueda's report.
I count on Parliament to help.

We can all see this.
Finally, primarily tools ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is interesting.
Where are the group leaders?
Well, I too have a dream.
However, we must take small steps.
There are red lines in the road.
2007 was a year of economic growth.
As a rule, though, 99% of them are men.

Thank you very much, Mrs McGuinness.
We cannot accept this.
How many tonnes of beef?
How much access?
Two other points.

That is something quite different.
Our agriculture is in great difficulty.
My group and I share these concerns.
This is not scaremongering.
It has not been good.
You are not telling the truth!
This is the truth, Mr De Gucht.
They should sort it out themselves.
It has not requested a new mandate.
Go back to the drawing board.
Where, I ask, is the consistency?
That is why I am extremely concerned.
Venezuela almost did not accede.
I think this is an outrage.
Today I took eight speakers.
First of all on the mandate.
That is still true.
We are not instructed by the Council.
We will stick to that.
On sugar:
We will do that.

This attitude, I find, is appalling.
Let us return to the report itself.
So here we need an answer.
This brings us to labelling.
Finally, a word on aquaculture.
However, we must be clear.
This should not need to be the case.
The first is the IUU Regulation.
We must continue to pursue this.
Europe needs fish.
Europe cannot have it both ways.

Mr Gallagher, we have to carry on.

What does this mean in practice?
There is still a long way to go.
It is often more than that, however.
So far, Europe has only preached.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Thank you.
This is horrifying, but true.
I believe we are in agreement on that.
We need answers to this too.
That is always a problem, of course.
How will they manage?
How can they insure themselves?
Do we need solidarity funds?
Mr Leinen indirectly referred to Libya.
The second is the financial framework.
What do I mean by 'anticipate'?
No such legislation yet exists.
That is why we are holding this debate.
That is why we are taking action.
There is no question about that.
That is an overreaction.
Who cares?
This is absolutely unacceptable.
Here at least, one can still speak.
No one had this information.
After all, this is urgently needed.
The first is the controls.
These controls are essential.
Why is liability so important?
Such things are not regulated properly.
She is right about that.
I think a few points spring to mind.
We support this too.
This is highly instructive.
I wish to make three points.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The lesson is obvious.
Thank you.
Access to drinking water is increasing.
Access to energy is increasing.
That is reality.
We simply cannot survive without it.
We need much more pressure.
Marine life is in a poor state.
Mr Deva also gives figures in dollars.
As you know, my pet subject is water.
Yet the Council is silent.
It should be done in nation states.
I would say both.
How can we be more responsible?
Models are in place.
Those are just a few examples.
Why a few?
Many of you mentioned financing.
It is also about private financing.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
I can give you more examples.
We need to see it implemented.
Allow me to make a few short remarks.
What sort of social Europe is that?
That is our goal.
For you, everything is fine.
I am French.
Please, what are you afraid of?
However, there are many other issues.
I am open to taking further steps.
We have to improve our instruments.
This is all part of a process.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
We made this deal.
They must not now fail this promise.
We were ready when they were ready.
They always know how to find a way.
And rightly so.
Where will that leave us then?
The matter is quite simple, in fact.
Do we realise what we are discussing?
This is beyond me.
What a load of nonsense!
How profoundly sad!
That is all I can say on that score.
(SL) Congratulations Tanja.
It is a fact; it is the reality.
This is a document from 7 May 2010.
Unquote.
Further challenges await us.
We have been monitoring very closely.
All countries must be treated equally.
A few words on Kosovo before I end.
Kosovo is not forgotten.
Kosovo is not ready.
We are working with them.
They need to do more.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Our role is to encourage them.
This idea needs to be put paid to.
We will stay on the ball.
That is our road map.
However, we will not stop there.
We must nevertheless remain realistic.
I am fed up of it.
The facts are clear.
G20 was clear.
Let us release it and use it.
They are doing that.
Let us not move away from that.
However, we must not stop there.
This gives cause for concern.
This is the transatlantic balance.
These need to be carried out regularly.
So this is our approach at the moment.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Written statements (Rule 149)
In fact, it is quite the opposite.
The system could, however, be improved.
I would like to make two brief points.
I am looking forward to seeing them.
They still do it.
Madam President, I will be brief.
Is that a cartel?
One point, Mr Lehne.
There are possible improvements.
They are very welcome.

We therefore need to stop it.
Its legitimacy is not in doubt.
We cannot force people to accept it.

That gives us our framework.
We must support it.
17 Member States are at less than 18%.
The overall absorption rate is 17.95%.

(GA) Thank you, Mr President.
This is for two reasons.
This is what we call 'skill mismatch'.
Is this still the case?
It seems that we all agree on this.
We need more, not less, Europe.

Children are for life.

Thank you very much.
Women's pay is 27% lower than men's.
It is time to bring an end to this.
If it is, then I say no.
We should have social responsibility.
Who is going to pay?
Which company can pay?
I call on you to be responsible.
We have a heavy burden for the future.

So where is the progression?

We are not starting from nothing.
Maternity provision is about health.
Naturally, that is not the only cause.
In this case, we have no alternative.
None of it.
For me, that includes women.
In this situation, women need our help.
Therefore, I am in favour.
Of course it does.
I think this is important.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is the problem we have.
The game will be cleared for them.
That is my hypothesis.
One size simply does not fit all.
That was my first point.
Indeed, I hope that we keep to this.
I would emphasise three points.
The state?
Businesses?

That is not acceptable.
What do we actually want in this area?
What else should it be?

When will the negotiations start?
When is action going to be taken?
Thank you very much Mr President.
I hope you will not disappoint us.

This report merits my vote in favour.
This cycle needs to be reversed.
The underlying reasons are varied.

That is why we voted against it.
(12699/2010 - C7-0202/2010 -; and
(13472/2010 - C7-0263/2010 -.
This, then, is what 2011 is like.
We no longer have two chances.
Thank you for your attention.
This is an important issue.
1%!
We need the resources.
I am concerned about volatility.
I will make four points.
Firstly, the financing of agencies.
Mr President, thank you for the floor.
What do they solve with these funds?
Surely not the crisis.
Thank you for your attention.
Why is no speaker designated here?
That is a good question, Mr R√ºbig.
This is very modest.
We must not forget that.
Firstly, then, we are being restrained.
There must be an increase here.
Otherwise, we will run into problems.
We are happy with the result.
We voted wrongly in this regard.
We will see!
That is something, at least.
This was not an option.
Europe is now desperate.
(Applause from the EFD Group)
It is only the PVV.
It is necessary.
We do have a lot of discretion.
There is no need for an EU-wide tax.
It is not an end in itself.
We do not agree with this attitude.
The question is, how?
Let us be consistent.
I think that is quite acceptable.
So I can speak as whatever.
The unanimous agreement is there.
The show must go on.
There is one more thing.
There is also a reserve for this.
After all, Europe must save too.

We await your proposals in this regard.
All that should make us think.
Heading 1b has often been mentioned.
Thank you, Commissioner!
Thank you for your attention.
Enjoy your bananas!
Thank you for your comments.

Budget review (debate)

That is the question.
Why?
That is what happened.
That is the reality.
That, in fact, is the reality.
But let us look to the future.
That is again, I think, very important.
Finally, on own resources.
I will believe that when I see it.
Honestly!
'What is it not?'
'Why a budget review?'
This is what is completely missing.
Mid-term revision.
This is also for the Council.
This work should involve brave reforms.
I know this is a difficult issue.
Thank you for your attention.
Will we say 'yes' or 'no' to these?
We should all take part in this debate.
This is indeed untenable.
We have an R&D target of 3%.
They are noticeably unforthcoming.
However, this strategy needs funding.

This is coming late, really late.

Also, the initial target was not met.
Current efforts are not working.
We are failing.
We followed the same route.
We have to act, and act fast.
Are any improvements noticeable?
I would just like your views on that.
Other methods are already being used.
I will now turn to the other question.
Subject: Aquaculture in the EU
I would appreciate your answer.
We are not satisfied with it.
This is encouraging.
The others are not so easy.
Two percent is a very small amount.
This is a general rule.
Greece has a special problem.
That concludes Question Time.
We have achieved the goal.
We have strict rules.
Thank you very much for your attention.
This should create greater liquidity.
I think this is a good idea.
Let us not forget farmers.
The multiples have been winning.
Sometimes, it can lead to bankruptcy.
Thank you for your attention.
So we have broad agreement.

Sludge catastrophe in Hungary (debate)
Let me now turn to the EU response.
The government was informed of that.

You have also referred to this earlier.
That is wholly unacceptable.
We need to help the people.
What happened there is dreadful.
Did they carry out sufficient checks?
Please forward it to Mr Buzek.
All of them would have been avoidable.
There is no good explanation for this.
What do you mean by it?
Is this really enough?
There was only one protective wall.
Then there are the inspections.
Those inspections were inadequate.
That must not be the result of this.

Waste must be recycled or reused.
We must record dangerous materials.

What can we do?
I would say two things here.
Let me make this very clear.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
However, that is not all.
The next item is the debate on:
What has happened to those enquiries?
Have you received a response?
We have asked for this before.
Do we have a list?
It is that simple.
Citizens are watching us.


Now, what has happened?
Well, France has given an answer.
Let historians one day look at that.
Now, objectively, what has France done?
Well, we got it.
Let us see if they do it.
I believe they are going to do it.
So something has happened.
You have seen CNIL's results.
I have read them too.
What about the Netherlands?
This database has since been deleted.
Please allow me to finish my remarks.
(Exclamation)
Other newspapers said that it would.
The Mens file.
The CNIL is a reputable body.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Parliament did its job.
We still maintain this position.
The case is, therefore, still open.
The debate is closed.
Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes
Closure of the sitting
Opening of the sitting
We checked the issue.
We will do what you want.
It is great.
The reason is very simple: relevance.
But let me be clear.
Overall, I believe we are on track.
This summit comes at a critical time.
What do we want to achieve in Seoul?
IMF reform, in particular, is overdue.
This is not easy.
We have come forward with Europe 2020.
Our work is not yet complete.
Many thanks for your attention.
We have to do something about it.
That is our ambition.
(Applause)
I offer him my sincere congratulations.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Great!
That is a dramatic development.
(Applause)
That really would open a Pandora's box.
Let us be clear about that.
That is the third one on the table.
Faites vos jeux!
You can go for it.
I have my own thoughts for you also.
Well, there is a woman - Mrs Merkel.
The trouble is who is Jim?
Is it Mr Cameron or Mr Barroso?
That is the dilemma for the Commission.
It is not enough to say 'I want'.
My four-year-old son says 'I want'.
No.
This year, it is GBP 6 billion.
Next year, it will be GBP 8 billion.
I hope it happens.
Let us have a new treaty.
Thank you.
We are happy to go.
It is our money!
(Applause)
(Applause)
We need to move forward.
We need to find the answers.
We have not yet overcome the crisis.
It is the beginning.
That is a problem.
This causes us concern.
I will read the text in English:
Of course we do.
Do you genuinely support it?
It is now time that you did so.
(Applause)
Thank you.
Is the Council prepared to accept that?
The Union budget is not enough.
There is no alternative.
We made proposals to improve the text.
We are continuing to fund the banks.
They are still buying them.
There must be some reason for that.
This is not adequate.
I congratulate the Commission.
I also congratulate the Council.
What does all this mean?
That is something that we want too.
We want to make a difference.
That is what we are waiting for.
This debate has yet to take place.
That will be the decisive thing for us.
This is not being discussed at all.
Other measures are needed too.
Europe does not exist in a vacuum.
Today it is divided.
The common global good does not exist.
I am tempted to add, 'no more bets!'
This is extremely dangerous.
The solution is clear.
This is what they want from us.
In my view, this is quite correct.
The crisis is far from at an end.
What have these solutions been?
So why my indignation?
Thank you for your attention.
There is no other way.
Mr President, one minute it shall be.
First, to Mr Zƒ´le.
(Applause)
This is our view.
The debate is closed.

This is not the way to run Europe.
We have given the floor to two MEPs.

I fully agree with Mr Rangel's report.
This, to my mind, is unacceptable.
I am therefore voting for this report.
I voted in favour of this regulation.
Yet where are we now?
I hope that this will come about.
I have therefore voted against it.
I therefore voted against this report.
You can be sure that we will help you.
We will follow its activity closely.
I was one of the MEPs who abstained.
I have therefore voted against it.
I find that unacceptable.
Children are precious.
They must be protected.
So must their mothers.
I regret the outcome of this vote.
It must not be made any weaker.
It has been a long process.
Who is going to foot the bill for that?
Malta is a case in point.
Let us listen to them and act.
This must change.
This is what the public expects.
It produces wealth founded on hot air.
It must be changed.
Therein lies the real crisis.



But it does something else.
What is up for debate?
I now turn to the report.
We accepted the request.
Now we come to the most debated issue.
We very much welcome this invitation.
We ask for your support for this.
This is working well.
There are currently 36 civil conflicts.
I am very pleased to support this.
The European Commission has no money.
You deceived me there, Ana.
This is central to the debate.
Evidently, selfishness is king.
It is our duty.
This is, of course, a misprint.
This money does not grow on trees.
The EU must show the way.
What can be done about this?
It is a common challenge that we face.
Transnistria was mentioned.
That is the reasoning behind it.
Thank you very much.

Thank you, Commissioner Piebalgs.
The debate is closed.
Ukraine (debate)
There is method to it.
We know this from China.
Ukraine was on a very good path.
As I say, I really am concerned.
It is closing its doors to us'.
That was on Monday.
That would be showing commitment.
We have nothing against Ukraine.
Ukraine was in chaos for five years.
We witnessed this chaos.
Thank you.
(LV) Yes, I am happy to reply.

Such a move has never happened before.

This is a start.
We have very qualified staff there.
Subject: Bio-waste
Thank you, Minister.
My comments were not directed at you.
Thank you for your response.
You mention the Irish problem.
Just two points very briefly.

Two questions, two answers.

Now to the North-South imbalance.
That concludes Question Time.
Composition of committees: see Minutes
We have a tight calendar to work to.
It is an intelligent proposal.
That is very positive.
Why?
That is the reality.
They would do well to backtrack.
We all agree that we have to help.
What do I mean by that?
That is a good thing, I feel.
Does this ratio add up, too?
Are these figures correct?

Where is this programme, Commissioner?
What are its key elements?
I will leave you with these questions.
Members referred to Italy.
That is the key question this evening.
That is my first remark.
So this is not immediately harming us.
I would even say the opposite.
The debate is closed.

I am sorry, there is a problem.
I will speak later.
The European Court ...
No, it is not working.
I am sorry.
(The speaker stops again)
Allow me to add one more thought.
(The speaker stops)
It is a real labelling con.
We owe this to our citizens.
For the rest, let us wait and see.
We feel that it is right.
We are on the road at last.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Where are we?
I will come back to that later.
This is an EU success.
Today, I am somewhat concerned.
Much has been gained on this issue.
If not, when do you intend to sign?
I look forward to hearing your answers.
Why was that?
Will the Commission do an assessment?
How would this work in detail?
I welcome those statements.
Who is going to control the providers?
Maybe you do not trust me.
I am the Commission.
Maybe you do not trust the Council.
So be a little bit patient.
There is no initialling yet.

Moldova now faces a turning point.
Time is not on our side.
There is much to be done very soon.
Commissioner F√ºle also mentions this.
Let us not fool ourselves.
The Communists do not want integration.
Moldova is a divided country.
Moldova today is an independent state.
It is true that it has many problems.
History has played a big role in that.
That change has taken place.

Integrated Maritime Policy (debate)
The first of these areas is transport.
The next area is shipbuilding.
Fish are not just a source of food.
This represents a major challenge.
Then we can discuss this issue further.
We will be supporting this report.
This was rejected once before.
I do not believe it is necessary.
A day, a ship, a death.
The emissions limits must be the same.
This can hardly be what the EU wants.
The second point is blue growth.
We need to be consistent in this area.
Thank you very much, Mr Pirillo.
This is what the report is all about.
However, it is a very varied subject.
That is the current wording.

What is Europe doing for us?
That is what we want to do.
We cannot find this social clause.
We are calling for collective redress.
I believe we are not quite there yet.
That is the real problem.
We appreciate that.
Europe is no longer the Europe of 1985.
We must do more to tear down barriers.
We have to be clear-sighted.
It is time for action.
He has all our support.
We have been consulting for 20 years.
Another example relates to passengers.
When will we have it?
What are we going to get?
I therefore welcome this ambition.
That is the ambition.

Why is this?
There are plenty of questions.
What does European research policy do?
What is innovation?
That is something new.
In this regard, you have our support.
This is something we must not do.
I think that we are due some answers.
How are we going to support it?
What will be the basis for it?
There will be innovations in time.
Certainly not.

Were you aware of this?
Greece is once again causing problems.
We do not have money to give away.
This means that action has to be taken.
This amounts to around EUR 700 million.

I think we did a good job.
Why is it a small and bitter victory?
It is because we are optimists.

Why did this happen?
This is ridiculous.
There is much ground to be covered.
This truly was a monumental disaster.

The first is how we can best help.
My fourth point concerns engagement.

We started working in September.
After months of work, we had stalemate.

Why?
What do you intend to do?
I would like an answer today.
You must respect them.
Please adopt these principles.
I will give my reasons for that.
The scientific advice is clear.
But let us keep the policy as it is.
I can support these amendments.
There is only one exception, however.
So we have this margin.
How has it been decided upon?
Why not 6 000 or 7 000?
We need to do that.
Moreover, people have short memories.
Speculation must be ended completely.
That is not our aim.
I consider that outrageous.
We should strongly oppose that.

The most important issue here is time.
Let us look at the example of Gaza.
It is a weapon of war.
We must find ways to act.
Their stories are horrific.
We should always bear this in mind.
This is the way forward, colleagues.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
That is what it must be.
Of course, this is totally incorrect.
It was a successor arrangement.
Therefore, this argument is incorrect.
What will happen next?
State aid distorts competition.
This is why the justification is wrong.
What is more, he makes no secret of it!
The result has been increased poverty.
This does not have to be the case.
That is both admirable and remarkable.
This must not happen in the EU.
I can only say, yes, we do need one.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
I refer to the costs of emissions.

Oral explanations of vote
But please listen to us next time.
I endorsed this report.
I give my support to Mrs Joly.
Needless to say, I endorsed the report.
Written explanations of vote
Here is the explanation of my vote.
We must protect these workers.
Here is the explanation of my vote.
Here is the explanation of my vote.
That is the message of today's report.
in writing. - I voted for this report.
I welcome this phasing out.
I voted for it.
It is rather a technical text.
Our group has voted in favour.
in writing. - Very easy vote, this one.
We simply had to agree, and we did.
This was signed on 30 November 2009.
That is also true of this agreement.
I voted for this report.
I am voting in favour of this report.
Those measures have borne fruit.
Heads I win, tails you lose ...
Their national currency, that is!
I am voting against this report.
We do not support these objectives.
There are many more examples.
I voted in favour of the resolution.
Accordingly, I supported this report.
I voted for the report.
I supported this report.
The Commission proposed 1 October 2014.
That would benefit the whole of Europe.
Thank you very much.
And that is only one of many cases.
We voted against this report.
I fully support these objectives.
This is a strategy which will backfire.
Statement by the President
2011 budget (debate)
I would like to begin our discussion.
We regret this.
Agreement could have been reached.
What is that reality?
I do not think so.
(Applause)
It is not about money.
We have agreed on the money.
I am rather surprised.
What happens next?
It is the EU's money.
(Applause)
That much is completely obvious.
Here we are now five years later.
On the figures, let us be very clear.
Let us be very clear on this.
My request is very simple.
It is not just a budget.
Why?
After all, it is not complicated!
My final comment concerns Ireland.
Well, have you got it yet?
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is how we can reach a compromise.
I know that.
I repeat: it is a minimum standard.
That is a different subject.
But this, I fear, will never happen.
However, we can make progress.
I would like to thank you, Mr Barroso.
Let us be patient.
This is a very important discussion.
They must show what they are made of!
How will we achieve these tasks?
Of course we must have one.
It is a question of flexibility.
We must, therefore, have flexibility.
Now there is an opportunity to grow.
Nothing comes of a centralised policy.
The exercise will soon be over.
Well done, I say.
Not a bit of it.
Is this the end of the EU?
No, it is not.
So why not?
Why can we not deliberate on this?
Quite the contrary!
Please research for yourselves!
It cannot go on like this any longer!
Let us try to avoid that.
I do not understand.
That is our red line.
Please, Council, try again.
Everyone was opening the throttle.
This year it is the opposite.
There is no other solution.
However, our efforts are not over.
What is happening there?
Quite the contrary.
But let me talk about the future.
In for a penny, in for a pound.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I am excluding that.
Therefore, we need to respond.
We will have to find common ground.
How could you explain this to us?
We have certain expectations.
Mr Schulz, I did hear your question.
I believe no one has been spared.
Who is to blame?
Why is this issue important?
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Now is the time to maintain momentum.
Europe's citizens would expect this.
Thank you for your attention.
Europe has learnt much from the crisis.
The first issue is growth policy.
We simply do not have enough.
You are right, Mr Barroso.
More needs to happen in this area.
My third point relates to tax policy.
This is a very important issue.
Why am I saying this?
But that is not enough.
You have the monetary report.
Now a word on the European Semester.
I wish you good luck.
Your choices are therefore ineffective.
The same thing is happening in Ireland.
I will dwell on a few specific topics.
Another study has been commissioned.
We cannot go on like this.
Achieving this target is critical.
2011 will be a decisive year.
I would like to remind him of that.
Could I just make one final point?
Some problems: education.
That is true.
Thank you very much.
However, that really is not enough.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
'Depending on'.
'May adopt'.
'In 2012'.
It is time they were done.
We all agree on the diagnosis.
It is a necessity for all.
These two statements give us a vision.
They are ambitious.
What have you done instead?
Will they be encouraging?
Why is this?
Because it is all about the future.
None at all.
I fully agree with her on this.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Question Time (Commission)
Secondly, he mentioned grids.
You mentioned the media.
I have a proposal for you.
I want to answer this very openly.
However, I have the following question.
Subject: Anglo Irish Bank
I very much hope so.
I cannot go into the details.
Subject: Tax burden in Greece
Subject: Ireland's corporation tax rate
That concludes Question Time.
This is not serious.
In sum, this is a terror state.
I believe that this is regrettable.
That is simply unacceptable.
There are other cases pending.
The debate is closed.
CAP simplification (debate)
I apologise most profusely for that.
Let the farmers produce the food.
Why are we having this?
How can this be remedied?
I think you have plenty of ammunition.
That is far too many.
It is time to act upon this report.
Bureaucracy must not ruin us.
That is highly commendable.
This is simply ridiculous.
We are fooling ourselves in this House.
I described it as 'green tape'.
There is a climate of fear.
We have to break that climate of fear.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
That is our message.
We owe this to the bees.
(The President cut off the speaker)
However, that is not enough.
Let us support the bees.
No change there then.
In truth, these are all guesses.
Amazing.
Without bees, many crops would fail.
The information campaign is there.
It just needs to be picked up on.
Yes, Europe can be useful.

One clarification.
This is the big lesson from the crisis.
It is a vital responsibility.
People are scared.
That is the reality in Europe.
That is the reality in Europe.
They applaud this enthusiastically.
These Members are sitting over there.
(Applause)
(Heckling)
I will attempt to continue.
Mr Langen is always very excitable.
Could you explain that to us?
(Applause)
(Heckling)
That was what this man said.
I am almost finished.
(Applause)
Dear colleagues, we must go ahead.
I will take it into account.
He is an undemocratic fascist.
(Applause)
This must be taken seriously.
In fact, what exactly is the problem?
(NL) Mr President, that is right.
No action was taken against Mr Schulz.
I am willing to talk with you.
We will talk about it together.
We all know that.
Something needs to change here.
Thank you for your attention.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Does the economy dictate our policies?
There is chaos.
The money is running out.
I should thank Mr Van Rompuy.
Just look at these faces.
Look at the fear.
Look at the anger.
Your fanaticism is out in the open.
They should never have joined the euro.
But look at your response to them.
You are very dangerous people indeed.
After that, I suspect it will be Spain.
There will not be any more.
The EU wants to speak with one voice.
I have two questions, however.
Thank you in advance for your answers.
Some things are clear.
Deauville was a mistake.
What is economic governance?
There is a big question mark here.
We need to be clear here.
It needs to be put into practice.
Where was Mr Trichet?
Everyone knows that.
This is the reality.
(PT) Mr President, let us be frank.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Welcome
Welcome, colleagues.
Investment is also needed.
What is Europe now?
What will it be in the future?
For goodness sake, wake up.
The horse has already bolted.
Do you remember?
The answer to this is 'no'.
There are a few lessons to be learned.
We have to learn lessons.
Let me say the following.
This is going to change next January.
So I want to underline this point.
The euro has not been the problem.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
It is the very first time in my career.
We already know about that.
It is time to take action.
So we are going to introduce it now.
It is new and innovative.
That is the only reason.
We had no crisis mechanism before.
Many of them have.
We are assuming our responsibilities.
Let us not get our enemy wrong.
Allow me to give you the figures.
That is extremely low.
Its banks are well capitalised.
Let us not target the wrong enemy.
I am not making a criticism.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
It is beyond belief.
But now reality has hit.
Results of the G20 summit (debate)
Why are they not here?
It is wrong for them not to be here.
Where is the answer?
I would like an explanation.
Why ever not?
That is what we expect from you.
That is the first point.

(Applause)
I have a proposal to make.
Those abstaining.
That is not right.
That is not fair.
The House wants Mr Bloom to leave.
That is its expression.
We know your methods.
They are unacceptable, anti-democratic.
That is all I have to say to you.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Ehler.
Now just a minute please.
Just quieten down please.
Mr Madlener you have the floor.
Now - thank you.
That is an end to the matter.
I shall speak about Rule 152.
No, sorry.
Thank you very much.
Mr Salatto has asked for the floor.
The next item is the vote.
Explanations of vote
Oral explanations of vote
I endorsed the report.

That is the main source of information.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is why I voted in favour of it.
I see you are in a difficult...
(The President cut off the speaker)
I heard what you said.
I shall report that to the House.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
They just have not chosen to do so.
Written explanations of vote
I voted in favour of this report.
I am voting against this report.
We must not ignore that.
This creates health inequalities.
Is that not already a promotional move?
Was that really the aim?
Was the game really worth the candle?
That is better than nothing.
I will therefore abstain.
This was key for the Greens/EFA.
No one need fear for their herbal tea.
Is that not already a promotional move?
Was that really the aim?
Was the game really worth the candle?
Mr Fjellner's report is very timely.
I supported this report.

We therefore voted for this report.
The directive is being simplified.
I fully support Mrs Evans's report.
I have therefore abstained from voting.
open scope
differentiation between RoHS and REACH
modification of the exemption criteria
specific provisions on nanomaterials.
Clear criteria are laid down for this.
I am voting against this text.
Financial supervision (signing of acts)
This will be done in a few minutes.
But our work of course is not finished.
What can I say in conclusion?
We talk about this in the report.
We need a European energy community.
Research is another important aspect.
We do not want that to happen.
(Applause)
Ten years ago, there was nothing.
China is moving and they move fast.
(Applause)
We do not need a new energy policy.
You mentioned energy efficiency.
Jens Rohde is right.
I have two concrete questions for you.
This is one of the biggest obstacles.
I do not think we should act like this.
They are ready, they are up to speed.
You can move forward.
This brings us to the single market.
It undermines the whole strategy.
A penny saved is a penny gained.
This is crucial.
Action: that is what is needed.
This is precisely what is not needed.
Why?
This report contains the solution.
Thank you.
Will we get consensus in Europe?
If we do, what will the consensus be?
Not an easy undertaking.
Please trust me and Mr Almunia.
Will it be less or will it be more?
I do not agree with that.
Thank you once again.
I go along with that.
We have worked out a certain consensus.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Better late than never, however.
What, in fact, does it mean?
What are these conditions?
What is a substantial balanced package?
No change there.
From that we can improve things.
Indeed, why should they?
I am a farmer by profession.
The outcome was not so good.
How are we going to do that?
That is a simple fact.
Why should we contribute towards it?
I want to see our cap tightened.
I want us to move up from 20% to 30%.
But maybe we need a fallback position?
We have got to save our resources.
We have got to become more competitive.
We know 30% is possible.
Obviously not.
Every study shows this to be so.
He lost the elections.
This goal is important.
A strong message is needed.
How can we do that?
Why is that?
That is the problem.
My fellow Member presented the figures.
You have our support, Commissioner.
Therefore, let us make this decision.
We had one microphone for the EU.
This is a great mistake.
This policy is going nowhere.
Mrs Hassi also spoke about LULUCF.
She is absolutely right.
Let us be honest about this.
Now that is being realistic.
It is much warmer.
It is time to change course.
We must remain credible.
This attitude must not win at Canc√∫n.
We have had enough of that.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Now my three comments.
I would argue probably not.
That was something we actually gained.
There were some questions on the CDM.
Yes, it is a problem.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The reality is, however, far from rosy.
How is this possible?
Hooray, as the Council said.
It grew rich by creating wealth.
The dying cannot wait.
We should be proud of this.
We already have this strategy.
It is a problem that must be resolved.
It is a two-way street.
It is not that we wish to preach.
That is rather fragile.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Situation in Western Sahara (debate)
We believe this is unacceptable.
The third point is closely linked.
We know who they are.
Let us make that possible.
I went there a few hours beforehand.
This is a good idea.
It should be done.
We must get back to what matters.
Would the truth be so hard to face?
So why is it not being done?
I would just repeat the last sentence.
That brings the debate to a close.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Ukraine (debate)
Ukraine is part of our neighbourhood.
Let us get back to the summit.
This is obviously very important.
These are facts.
But let me be clear.
So far, so good - touch wood.
That was evident at the summit.
Mrs Harms is sitting in the middle.
This is important on all sides.
We need to exercise moderation, here.
This is extremely important.
Emotions have subsided.
What is this resolution about?
There are two Klitschkos.
Here we must create real cooperation.
Thank you.
When the law was passed we welcomed it.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
We cannot explain this to our public.
(The President cut off the speaker)
It certainly is my job to interrupt.
It is labelled 'slow down'.
(Heckling)
(Heckling)
It is precisely the same thing.
They must be 'implementable'.
We are sorry.'
End of quote.
What economic genius thought that up?
It will be the citizens and businesses.
Competition is necessarily distorted.
This would be a disaster.
That certainly must be addressed.
We need more of that.
Unfortunately I cannot be exhaustive.
All of this is absolutely critical.
Thank you very much, Mr D√©sir.
The debate is closed.
What is the current state of affairs?
Are there cases of this kind?
That is all well and good.
I will give you another example.
Why is this happening?
We must open up our markets.
I look forward to hearing your answers.
I strongly condemn such actions.
There, I would like to be very clear.
Please bear this in mind.

I consider this a very serious issue.
55% were completed within three months.
This decline is encouraging news.
This arose in 36% of all enquiries.
Thank you.
Of course not!
It is great entertainment.
It will open your eyes time and again.
This is an important report.
That problem is public awareness.
The facts are relatively clear.
The amendments were rejected.
Things urgently need to improve.
No action gets taken there.
Hence, they turn to the Commission.
What does the Commission do?
I wonder.
(ES) Bon dia, Madam President.
This is very important.
You are aware of that, Mr Ombudsman.
This must be addressed.
It cannot be allowed to continue.
I think Mr Diamandouros knows this.
So please bear with us sometimes.
Now, most of them apply it.
We are still in the initial phase.
So far, the results are very positive.
Let me begin with a general remark.
The two were unrelated.
I shall say two more things.
I want to thank him for that.
Two more things.
A comment on Mr Migalski's question.
Regrettably, this is not in my mandate.
That is very important for me.
I only intend to discuss the substance.
That is what we need.
I would like to see this proposal soon.
I also believe that this is important.

These are very ambitious campaigns.

This is our duty as parliamentarians.
This is also essential for business.
This is all very positive.

It is not about permanent residence.
It is not about a work permit.
Thank you for your response.
Why?
That in itself is a political decision.
These criteria are open.

We have been there.
We have talked to our interlocutors.
We are trying to assess this problem.

What a disaster it has proven to be.
This is fundamentally wrong.

Too many lives have been destroyed.
This is a major push factor.

This is not enough, Commissioner.
I find that unacceptable.

Hardly any.
So where are we today?
The answer is 'no'.
That is a good thing.
That is guaranteed.
Mr President, that is simply not true!
This will lead to social disasters.
That is how it should be seen.
I welcome it and therefore endorse it.
It was impossible.
We need to protect them.
It does not create discrimination.
Nobody wants social dumping.
We want to protect these people.
We keep repeating this to the Council.

I am in favour.




That is why I voted against the report.
I welcome the report and the debate.
I voted against this text.
I am in favour of cohesion.
2.
There is only one problem here.
All of these things cost money.
We always have too many priorities.
We must not forget this.
(The sitting was opened at 15:05)
We are ready to begin taking questions.
I think the answer today is obvious.
Will you support him in this?
That is the reality.
Thank you for your answer.
(Applause)
That is my first point.
We believe it is in our interest.
I would like to ask the same question.
I cannot, therefore, comment on that.
I cannot comment on them.
They have disappeared.
What can and should the Commission do?
It is not negotiable.
We are working on that.
I fully support those efforts.


1.
Frankly, there has been no result.
That is not true.
This is my first question.
That concludes Question Hour.
I am pleased about this.
This process has by no means finished.
It is a sore subject.
This has not been a walk in the park.
This is really very important.
That is right.
This is a sign of our optimism.
The matter has been deferred.
We want to discuss our own resources.
The Commission has taken its position.
Everyone was in agreement.
One month later, where are we on this?
We have gone back to square one.
The 2011 budget is about to be adopted.
It ignores flexibility and ITER.
We have always opposed that.
Lisbon is clear on it.
They would not be at all happy.
Should we draw conclusions from this?
I think we should.
Should we cut back on agricultural aid?
Should we rein in the Structural Funds?
That is unacceptable.
We must understand that.
Look at Greece, Portugal and Ireland.
I have two questions about that.
I very much doubt this.
Budget increases are always difficult.
We could and should do our work better.
We have made some gains in agriculture.
This is ridiculous!
No.
Of course not.
Are we moving forward?
Yes.
Everyone has made some compromises.
Everyone has made some concessions.
Is there still much to be done?
Of course.
No.
I am pleased to hear that.
This needs to be debated.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Credit rating agencies (debate)
I just have one point of criticism.
We owe this to our citizens.
I was never convinced.
This, too, has come to nothing.
ESMA will be brought into being.
The same is true here.
I thank you in advance for your reply.
Mrs Regner also mentioned this point.
Mr Klute, thank you for your comments.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
First and foremost, adaptation.
Secondly, technology.
We wanted to save the process.
That is really good.
But in Canc√∫n, we also took new steps.
On all three points, we made progress.
What does that mean?
Thank you very much for that.
(Applause)
That should please all of us.
Thirdly, we must do our homework.
Now let us look to the next one.
The work must now be stepped up.
Where are the post-Kyoto commitments?
How do we secure the funding?
But maybe we have an answer to that.

The gaps must be filled.
We are talking about scientists here.
The climate process is alive and well.
We in the EU must show that leadership.
Let us be clear.
That is what we need in Durban.

Really, society is not being won over.
Several have asked about the 30%.
It will have to be on the agenda.
We will continue that work.
A final word.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
However, it is better than nothing.
What was Europe's role in this story?
The EU played a leading role.
Question Time (Commission)
Part one
Subject: Protecting women's health
We are not starting from scratch here.
It does not suit you!
Is the Greek Government to blame?
The first question is to Mrs Reding.
Part two
Will the Commission say:
Is that a reason for not acting?
On the contrary.
It is not a question of asylum alone.
You are involved in a traffic accident.
You have injured someone.
They will receive an answer in writing.
We now move to questions to Mr F√ºle.
We had a group meeting.
I therefore just missed my question.
Mr Posselt, I am very sorry.
There are a number of reasons for this.
I will be very brief, Commissioner.
Yes, I have a question on Belarus.
Commissioner, that is three questions.
I will also include my prepared speech.
Their questions have not been reached.
They will get a reply in writing.
Mr Madlener, there really is no time.
Is this standard practice?
That concludes Question Time.
Energy Efficiency Action Plan (debate)
That is not good enough.
We are trailing behind.
The buildings policy is also important.
In my country - Germany - probably not.
That is surely not possible.
Then we need to ask: where do we start?
We have to link these two together.
Then comes the subject of transport.
I doubt it.
Stage 1 would be voluntary.
Thank you very much for today.
I am the rapporteur.
What is it in fact?
I will take today as my starting point.
Secondly, energy security.
We are thus making one on renewables.
What does it mean for our populations?
What do we know about the future?
By conserving energy.
Thank you for your attention.
That is the right approach to take.
You mentioned this issue, Commissioner.
Let us put a stop to that waste!
That is an incredible challenge.
Where can we make the biggest savings?
That is what this should be about!
We need to invest in this.
Mr Swoboda has also spoken about this.
How?

However, two quick points.
That is true, but not immediately.
Can we do this?
Are we ready to do so?
I am counting on you.
I have a second issue to raise as well.
Or let us take Portugal as an example.
I am an optimist and a realist.
Thank you all very much for today.
Why is it so important now?
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)

We are no longer prepared to give way.
The debate is closed.
Safety of toys (debate)
This is not the only problem, however.
Now that is how we ensure safety.
It is not going to be about marking.
We need to give this some thought.
What does that mean for us?
We will work closely together on this.

So what has to be done?
Therefore, we need to take action.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Therefore, this is a timely issue.
Agenda of the next sitting: see Minutes
Closure of the sitting
Opening of the sitting
The next item is the joint debate on:
What are they expecting?
How can we best reassure them?
For me the answer is clear.
We are moving fast in this direction.
These are, of course, closely linked.
When will we learn?
That takes courage.
Do not miss this opportunity.
We have to show them the way.
(Applause)
This has occurred twice now.
Help us!'.
This must not happen.
What about the different voices there?
That is simply not enough.
The euro is a stable currency.
Such a thing exists nowhere on earth.
And what are we being told here today?
We need to wait for what?
Propose it!
Why?
I am not saying that it is your fault.
That is it.
The only solution in today's debate.
But that is not true.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I do not want history to punish Europe.
Face up to your responsibilities.
(Applause)
Where is this going to end?
Well it will not be well.
It will not work.
What a farce this is.
Happy Christmas, everybody.
Funding will of course be a key issue.
Why?
It is all quite simple.
The euro is a stable currency.
This is the result.
I have one question for you.
It is in northern Europe.
Ireland has huge debts.
We know that.
(RO) Mr President, to err is human.
To persevere is diabolical.
It was definitely not Mr Papandreou.
It was Karamanlis.
(Uproar).
These are the reforms we need urgently.
So we will do our work.
(Applause)
It was the right thing to do.
(Applause)
It is simply not right.
This will not work.
That is just the way it goes.
This will not work.
Now we must look to the future.
We are caught in a trap.
I have my doubts about that.
Eurobonds are a sensible solution.
Why do we not proceed as follows?
How can we put money into the coffers?
Why is it not possible?
I do not agree with Mr Bullman.
Solidarity had become a one-way street.
This will simply make the gap wider.
(The President cut off the speaker)
However, this is not the case.
Instead we will take a step backwards.
We need more Europe.
This issue needs to be clarified.
That is fine, but it is not enough.
(Applause)
Let us stop playing with Europe.
This really is all about Europe.
It does not represent a solution.
Put an end to the discord.
Then we have seen what has happened.
Now we see the bitter results.
Mr Schulz, can you deny that?
Does he remember this?
Now you can see the bitter result.
I wanted to underline that.
That is worth remembering.
I think it should be put on the record.
Let him cast the first stone...
Why do they do that?
We would like to see them acted upon.
Madam President, firstly a complaint.
They are all to be welcomed.
That should not be done.
Debates such as this lead nowhere.
Innovative and motivating solutions.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This just leads to more questions:
(The President cut off the speaker)
These came from all sides.
However, it is relatively ineffective.
What should be done?
(Applause)
It is very rude and lacking in respect.
Mr De Rossa, a point of order?
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Thank you for your attention.
This situation is unacceptable.
We are ready to begin discussions.
Thank you very much.
Citizens' initiative (debate)
We badly need this.
We are honoured by your presence.
Who might participate?
Who might launch the initiative?
What is the procedure?
Extraordinarily simple.
The criteria for admissibility?
Just one condition: total transparency.
Incredibly simple.
(Applause)
This represents a major step forward.
(Applause)
I think we have achieved this goal.
I must say it was a very nice gang.
I really appreciate it.
I do, of course, agree.
It has been made as simple as possible.
We are not writing the Bible, here.
What type of changes do we need?
Thank you.
Transparency in this process is key.
Today is one of them.
This is a good result.
(Applause)
We must not disappoint the people.
Is it a petition?
Yes, but not a freely drafted one.
Is it a referendum?
Absolutely not.
Does that mean we are opposed to it?
No.
What can you do about that?
We politicians live in glass houses.
Thank you for your support.
(Applause)
This is a true compromise.
Thank you again for your cooperation.
Let us not make them wait any longer.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.

I therefore thank the rapporteur.
We must not allow this to happen.

A good start has been made here.
Can somebody tell me which momentum?
Of course nobody does.
Please respect this.
Ms Alfano, please continue.
I shall give you another 30 seconds.
Is that clear enough?
Do not do it again.
I want to congratulate the rapporteur.
Now they need to be implemented.
So thank you for your comment.
One group I want to commend though.
Written explanations of vote
The malicious intent is clear to see.
This combination forces me to abstain.
I voted in favour.
This compromise seems to be workable.
I also agree that:
Poland is not among them.
We need a law, not rules.
Sweden is not one of them.
I approved of this important document.
I am afraid not.
Nor does their arbitrary nature.
The public authorities have given up.
It is shameful.
I voted in favour.
This justification will be made public.

Who was responsible?
Whose salary was cut down?
Who was reprimanded?
No one.
Long live the European Council!
These are just some examples.
I voted in favour.

Not with my blessing.
I am against this report.
That is why I voted as I did.
It is a channel of communication.
Let us work and get it done.
However, it carries many dangers.
That is why I supported the report.
I voted for the motion.
This is good news.
1.
Energy - efficient technologies; 2.
Transport technologies; 3.
Efficient use of energy; 4.

I have voted accordingly.
The next item is the debate on
Otherwise, what do we see?
That is good.
This has been debated in Parliament.
And what are the major lessons?
Europe needs both.
Does a true impact assessment exist?
Any other reform will be insufficient.
Why has this happened?
Madam President, I will be brief.
So where is Article 9?
When are we going to see it?
I repeat, the minimum wage.
We do not want any more flannel.
No more pl√°m√°s.
No more Eurospeak.
That is what the Council will do.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)

A new strategy for Afghanistan (debate)
European values and principles matter.
Our strategy includes good proposals.
The war is having a huge cost.
The only solution is a political one.
1.
I am thinking here of Nimruz and Herat.
2.
3.
This is surely the only solution.
Perhaps we should negotiate with them.'
Today, I hear the same.
I shall tell you why.
I will give you three examples.
That is astonishing.
Mrs Ashton stated quite the opposite.
Nobody noticed this.
I even treated the Taliban.
Here, things are even worse.
(SL) Unquote.
Our citizens expect us to do so.
This is not new.
That would ruin our credibility.
That is very typical of him.

This is not a report on drones.

They are already there.

Why is it in a state of dissolution?
You did nothing about this.
The alternative would not make sense.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(NL) Mr President, I risk repetition.
I would agree with that.
This certainly was not the case.
You say: 'look at refugees'.
That is very important.
I doff my cap to you!
You did not answer me.
You did not do that.
We would simply like to say thank you.
I feared the opposite.
Congratulations once again.
Your Presidency was a great success.
(Applause)

Explanations of vote
Oral explanations of vote
This should not be the case.
Written explanations of vote
I therefore voted for this report.
It is sheer deception.
I will be voting against this text.
I voted in favour.
The Verts/ALE Group did so.
I voted in favour of this document.
There is still room for improvement.
The European Union is a global player.
I voted in favour of this report.
There are many challenges ahead.

That is the objective of this report.
However, much remains to be done.
I voted in favour of this report.
I voted in favour of this document.
Food security is a basic human right.
This cannot be rushed.
I welcome them.
I voted in favour of this report.
I congratulate Mrs S√¢rbu.
Farmers need security too.
Documents received: see Minutes
We are contacting our Member States.
I believe that is important.
We are ready to do so.
What is your answer to that?
We sought expert legal advice.
What is the timetable?
Give us the documents, please!
If not, why not?
So let us keep our commitment to peace.
So far, they have not committed to it.
How are you going to speed things up?
If they are on track, great.
Solidarity is important.
Solidarity cannot be an empty word.
Just one more thing about energy.
Please investigate the ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you.
That is certainly what we intend to do.
The only shortage is figures.
(Rapporteur: Fran√ßoise Grosset√™te).
What is at stake here for patients?
We have achieved a great deal.
(Applause)
I hope that Sweden does not do this.
There are numerous examples of this.
The story is almost laughable.
This is an important step forward.
Who are we helping, in particular?
The situation is a complex one.
Thank you all very much.

(The President cut off the speaker)
Many here spoke about that today.
Let us think about this, though.
This fear is not necessary.
This is surely a positive outcome.
(The President cut off the speaker)
These services are already being used.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Congratulations, Mrs Grosset√™te.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
We Hungarians share his opinion.
What are these opportunities?
Annex - Position of the Commission
Amendments:
We must treat them all equally.
To date, I have heard nothing.
We are aware of the problems.
We know all your arguments.
We are talking about a medical product.
I agree with my fellow Member entirely.
But what can be done in the EU?
Alzheimer's is a cruel disease.
I am returning to Mr Klein's petition.
What has happened in that time?
What can we do about this?
Let me focus on two aspects.
This is my first point.
My second point concerns research.
Why?
That is doubtless true!
No priority has been defined.
They are no longer alone!

Here is the medicine.
(The President cut off the speaker)

What is causing this resistance?
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Organisations do very valuable work.
Thank you.
Question Time (Commission)
Part one
Subject: Utilisation of European funds
The ESF supports people.

We have a problem with regard to visas.
Part two
Guidance is also critical.
No such study exists.
Will the Commission say:
That was very good.
Thank you very much indeed!
The problem is to follow up.
Of course, we need to be creative.
It is a substantial change.
That concludes Question Time.
It is not there to help people.
Haiti is a failing state.
That is the task that we see before us.
There is a link missing somewhere.
I wish you all the best!
Who will decide on the projects?
We must honour this debt of honour.
We should focus on food security.
Does the Commission share this view?
The crisis in Haiti is ongoing.
Our involvement is still needed.
We cannot abandon our responsibilities.
There is one other recommendation.
We all need to understand that.
This needs to be our top priority.


That has got to come very clearly.
We do need political stability.
They are a wonderful people.
We must not forget the people of Haiti.
First of all, coordination.
We need to be better at reconstruction.
My second point is about corruption.
Some of you mentioned Baby Doc's visit.
Is it visible?
Another point is where to invest money.
So the costs are very substantial.
No.
Again, I thank you for your support.
The debate is closed.
Waste crisis in Campania (debate)
The next item is the debate on:
That reply explains a great deal.
No, the problem was political.
We must not throw good money after bad.
What are the deadlines?




Since then, the situation has changed.



Italy did not meet the deadline.
It is a scandal.
It will not do.
Enough has seeped away already.
There are no excuses, however.
I know what I am talking about.
It seems this has now been done.
That is my sincere hope.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the debate on:
There are many examples of the problem.
You know what?
You will remember this.
This is subsidiarity.
We must not mix things up.
We must take action to stop this.
We must take action.
However, they are not sure of this.
It is just an assumption.
This is a completely natural debate.
When will this happen?
If nothing else, let us be consistent.
The debate is closed.

Agenda of the next sitting: see Minutes
Closure of the sitting
(The sitting was closed at 23:55)
Opening of the sitting
(The sitting was opened at 09:05)
We hope to secure your approval.
It is our common duty.
Our determination is clear.
I believe a new reality is emerging.
The markets want it.
Our international partners want it.
It does not undermine their authority.
The world has changed.
Thank you for your attention.
[Applause]
Push hard for this, let us not give in!
Opportunities have been missed again.
They are inappropriate or non-existent.
Mr Farage is nodding.
Let us act, for heaven's sake!
Very well, let us speed up!
That is the current state of affairs.
What should our next step be?
The stakes are high.
It is 'stability', is it not?
Nobody believes you.
The public does not support you.
I hope and pray the markets break you.
What if it does not work?
How should we go about that?
And so what does the European Union do?
Mr President, the EU cannot be trusted.
You ask me what my solution is today.
I would just like to add two more.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
No.
Is this the purpose of the euro area?
This is a question that I put to you.
This is the reality.
We need it.
Some of us would like to go further.
So how should we do it?
Once upon a time, it was 0.85.
We had nothing, though.
There was no macro-economic oversight.
It is a worthy explanation.
Look at developments on the markets'.
Clearly, reforms are often painful.
This is extremely urgent.
No!
There is an agenda - a clear agenda.
Can we go faster?
Yes!
As I said, there were two obstacles.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
We must continue with our debate.
Thank you very much for the invitation.
This is the crisis we are all facing.
There is a lot to do.
(Applause)
I have complete faith in your word.
I think you are right.
These are serious times.
We respect that.
(Applause)
That is a good thing.
(Applause)
(Applause)
(Heckling)
That is a good thing.
I would like to ask you a question.
(Applause)
Hungary needs a balanced media law.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Why?
(Applause)
(Interjection from Mr Cohn-Bendit: 'No!
No!')
Not you - you are an exception.
Obviously not!
Of course not!
Of course not!
Information should upset politics.
They all want balanced information.
You knew that twenty years ago.
(Applause)
Is it worthy of this post?
This would truly be a shame.
I would just like to make one point.
This situation must remain unchanged.
This does not only relate to Hungary.
I believe that this is very important.
Wake up Mr Orb√°n.
Tell them where to go.
And now it is the same.
I have two questions for you.
Are you aware of this?
This is one thing.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is also proven by its objectives.
There are many specific points.
There is no place for retreat here.
We are failing to do that!
(The President cut off the speaker)
Does that seem like culture to you?
We, too, disagree with it.
This is exactly what you are doing.
(Applause)
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President interrupted the speaker)
(Heckling)
In conclusion, I wish us all good luck.
Why are we cheering on the Fides party?
It likes the European Parliament.
Democracy works.
You have been elected.
Well done!
Europe works.
Well done!
Politics works.
That is good news!
You face economic challenges.
You want it to join.
We are in favour of that.
Taves bahtalo!
It has not yet done this.
We thought you were a liberal.
(Heckling)
That is what I would like to ask you.
(Applause)
We cannot allow it to continue.
Growth and jobs.
When will it be abolished?
The two are not the same.
The first is the Croatia question.
(Applause)
That is Hungary's media law.
[Applause]
So what are you protesting against?
And the list could go on and on and on.
So much for factual accuracy.
What are you protesting against?
This is not a matter of media laws!
Both problems need to be addressed.
I was never under that assumption!
(Murmurs of dissent)
(Applause)
Do not play one off against the other.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Schulz.
(The President cut off the speaker)
When Mr Orb√°n claims in this House ...
(Noise in the Chamber)
Are you mobilising the extreme right?
You are right to do so.
You invited us to dine with you.
What you have done is disgraceful!
(Applause)
These were his words.
Let us retain our dignity.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Europe remains its firm supporter.
What do you intend to do to revive it?
The matter is urgent.
Mr Orb√°n claims to be a democrat.
Let us hope that Hungary will follow.

Naturally, I voted in favour.

Madam President, Happy New Year.
What about China?
What about the United States?
Or India?
Long may that continue.
There is a big issue here.
It is important that we get it right.
These are very sensitive issues.
However, they are nevertheless allies.
I am not saying it is simple.
I congratulate them on that.
Those are very important questions.
We have come a long way down the road.
However, this report is very welcome.
Why?
Who can pick them up?
NGOs with shovels?
European Commissioners with buckets?
No!
But what happened?
So they did!
Lithuania's democracy is hard at work.
I say this as a doctor.

It is not a legislative resolution.

Information is also a key issue.

Serbia's future lies in the EU.
It is important to act in a global way.
This status quo has to be changed!
If nature destroys, people rebuild.
This homophobic hysteria must stop.
This is unacceptable.
But let us not be mistaken.
Urgent reaction is needed.
God cannot want forced observance.
It is time for action.
The UK or France?
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Concrete action is needed.
The victims need to be given faces.
This is paragraph 2 of our resolution.
What can we do?
If not, why not?
They think it an anachronism.
We are doing this among ourselves.
Where have we got to with this?
It is pure hate.
But this is not about numbers.
It is about liberty and identity.
The EU must not remain passive.
Christians in Cyprus are in danger.
We also have problems in Europe.
We must not be tolerant of intolerance.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Quite the opposite.
Criminal networks are rife.
This is absolutely vital.
Mr President, what is this all about?
I pay tribute to their memory.
We will continue to work on this.
The debate is closed.
Situation in Belarus
Our reaction should be a balanced one.
That was how it sounded.
Please check it.
No, it is not the interpretation.
It is a problem with the microphone.
Is it OK now?
I hope this explains what I meant.
What about new elections?
That is balanced politics.
Brussels must not abandon Minsk now.
Belarus should be suspended.
Belarus was used to block Euronest.
It really should not be like this.
All of those hopes have been dashed.
This is true.
It is not only about Belarus.
Did we do all that we should have done?
The elections were unfair.
However, there is yet to be a trial.
That is how we could help them.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
EU-Libya Framework Agreement
Indeed, political parties are banned.
Gaddafi is the Fidel Castro of Africa.
It was arms for prisoners.
That was arms for borders.
This is arms for bonds.

Neighbours cannot be ignored.
In my opinion, this is clear.
That message is very clear.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
You have two minutes.
Why?
This is absolutely urgent.
However, the reality is different.
We have a whole range of directives.
It is difficult.
Will we manage to do this or not?
That is what we must address.
I do not believe that.

Please allow me one final thought.

The first of these is energy.
What is the result?
Artificially high prices for consumers.
This must change.
What does this mean?
Thank you for your attention.

Are you willing to listen to him?
Many thanks.
What is the issue here?
More work is urgently needed on this.
Am I correct?
You have 15 seconds.
You are completely incorrect, sir.
Yes, I do invent rules.
Thank you for recognising that.
I am not in favour of it.
Times have since changed.
I think this is absolutely vital.
I can give another example.

The Arctic is 'cool'.
Why should we annoy them even more?
Which states are involved?
Which indigenous peoples are affected?
The talks held so far are not enough.
What exactly is this influence?
Only the experts can tell us.
We could do better.
We wanted a more coherent approach.
We have heard all about this.
This is an important matter.
I categorically reject this opinion.
planet, people and product.
(The President cut off the speaker)
On what do I base such a conclusion?
There are two aspects, however.
This is a virgin area a long way away.
The second issue is transport.

Firstly, the Arctic Information Centre.
I just wanted to clarify that.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place later.
All must tread carefully here.
It should not be in the EU.
Tread carefully indeed.
So I call upon the Commission to act.
This needs to be done now.
One such issue is maritime security.
They want to work with us.

This is a case of double standards.
This is a very sensitive subject.
However, legislation is not enough.

Europe must not remain silent.

The resolution speaks about this.
Therefore, we voted against the report.
A call I strongly endorse.
In fact, it is quite the opposite.
This report is an absurd credo.
I shall vote against it.

We supported a dirty regime.
That is what happened here.
We need peace in the Middle East.
That is what this Parliament expects.
We need to act decisively on this.
It did not do so.
Madam President, I am concluding.
These are weak parties.
We know where that has led.
Thank you very much.
Today I am quite sure of this.
A revolution is taking place there.
History demands it of us.
Do we want to be a major global player?
It is still not too late.
Everyone knows of others in the region.
Today he calls for a transition.
He wasted the time he had.

How to react then?
What kinds of regimes will result?
Be ambitious and we will support you.
President Mubarak must step down now.

I have been saying it for a long time.
I agree.
I am trying to do it.
It is a process.
That is what Europe offers.
That is what we are in the business of.

The status of Abyei remains uncertain.
I would like to add one last thing.
So, what can we do?
An example of this is Darfur.
I would like to address two points.
Firstly, debt write-off.
It is a right that we must honour.
The answer is clear: crude oil.
Thank you very much.
That is what I wanted to say.
The debate is closed.
Others still have to do so.
I am therefore going to be quite clear.
It is not a lesson in law.
The texts do not matter.
We know the texts.
Everyone made compromises.
It is simple.
Mrs Gy≈ëri, this is very important.
Why can we not do that?
You still have another opportunity.

I doubt it.
I could go on with a long list.

Written Statement (Rule 149)
The next item is the joint debate on:

The Council welcomes this decision.
That is very good.
In theory, it cannot be faulted.
The reality is slightly different.
My answer is very clear: it could not.
Certainly not.
There is even talk of EUR 75.
What is going on?
So we have to be very careful.
Now, what about this money?

What is this all about?
You know the situation.
I really feel a sense of urgency here.
The ball is now in the Council's court.
This is something very important.
This is putting people's lives at risk.
We should make sure that we do so.
It is needed today more than ever.
How can we do that?
I think that the opposite is the case.
Twenty-two thousand.
Legally, our arguments are sound.
It is a legal obligation.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The joint debate is closed.

That is our main goal.
We are on the way to achieving this.
This must not happen in future.
You need to be stricter.
This is extremely important.
Firstly, I want to mention the costs.
I look forward to that.
These are Amendments 101 and 102.
Tomorrow it has got to be the rule.
That is the key.
You need to explain this.
My second point is as follows.
Please read the directive.
Member States are not just good or bad.
It is a question of pure profit.
That is too little.
Secondly, the targets.
Thirdly, costs.
We have to do things differently.

This only weakens the EU's position.

That is why I voted as I did.
However, the EU is faced by a problem.
Therefore, I abstained from voting.
Sadly, we do not have a spare planet.
This is an important step forward.
Presently one third of it is collected.
We must not impose anything on them.
This must be done quickly.
Thank you.
That is unacceptable.
It is a real insult to Italy.
Time is pressing, we must act fast.
Thank you.

Thursday
Who wanted to speak on this request?
Please vote in favour.
This was an important piece of policy.
It is still far too early for that.
Firstly, the points of single contact.
(The President cut off the speaker)
So much for the reprimand.
Allow me to name just three of them.
We now need to really make that work.
I agree, but it also has to be timely.
Where are we now, Commissioner?
If not, I think that is pathetic.
That is short-sighted.
It is not waiting for us.
The review is therefore important.
I certainly embrace that concept.
It has been far too easy up to now.
We cannot afford to wait.
That is great.
Proper conditions must be in place.
I hope the baby is well!
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Now we are to do so a second time.
That will take place at a later date.
I think it really is enough now.
I have one more point to close with.
(IT) I turn now to our Italian friends.
We made a proposal.
There will be no discrimination.
There is nothing new about it.
It is time to cut the Gordian knot!
We will not relinquish a single right.
We need this now.
We have no time to lose.
The question is, under what conditions?
So exactly who is in favour of this?
We all share these principles.
What criteria were used?
Efficiency?
Are we talking about EUR 1 850?
Is it about timing?
This battle has only just begun.
Nevertheless, there is something new.
25 out of 27 states are participating.
The political framework has changed.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The time we lose never comes back.
Mr Lehne has already pointed this out.
It is also a great challenge.
There are three languages.
And what happens?
Why?
In this case, we need unanimity.
This was not a simple decision.
This is absolutely self-evident.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
I have no choice but to vote against.
This EU-wide patent makes sense!
Nothing has been decided yet.
That was in 1986.
The second reason relates to substance.
This is economically absurd.
It is of much wider public concern.
This is basically the central question.
I have not forgotten that.
The debate is closed.
The Commission intends to do so.
This is important for both sectors.
Let us follow this example.
This certainly must be looked at.
It is not good enough.
That is unacceptable.
That is not enough, however.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Thank you.
The next item is the debate on
Why include a list of priorities?
The next point is coordination.
Turning now to the legal basis.

And I am afraid of the answer.
That is appalling.
Some done, but a lot more to do.
It sounds rather like a threat.
We stand by them.
Our fight is their fight.
Their objectives are our objectives.
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing!
That is how it should be.
We need to act swiftly.
That concludes the item.

This is, of course, not sustainable.
(The President interrupted the speaker)
We all send her our very best wishes.
What do I mean by that?
We must not forget that.
This should depend on the dossier.
How are the discussions going?
How controversial are they?
This is what we have done.
This report is unacceptable.
They did not.
They are virtually all in cities.
He knows it will, and I know it will.
Does he think that is fair?
Does he think it is morally correct?
We must therefore be very careful.


Much more ambitious.
And why?


In the end, they appreciate that.
This is what we are trying to do.
So regulation for cars is in place.
Now it is the turn of vans.
In my view, that is a false comparison.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
But does it move us forward?
That, of course, is not a good thing.
Thank you.
Our group will therefore abstain.
This is fine in principle.
That is important, in my opinion.
It is good in patches.
One size does not fit all.
In the case of buses, it is two hours.
All these advantages are unacceptable.

The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at midday.

We have welcomed this decision.
We very much welcome this decision.
We will continue with that dialogue.

We must make use of this opportunity.
Sadly, that has not been the case.

That is why I voted as I did.

I therefore voted in favour.






However, this did not happen.
in writing. - I voted for this report.
That is why I voted as I did.
That is not all.
We believe this to be fair.
I welcomed the results of the vote.

I voted in favour of this text.
I voted in favour of this document.

I voted in favour of this report.
That is not enough.
This is disappointing.
The date is set for 2012.
This is quite a major investment.
Hence, my 'no' vote.
We should stick with 2014.
Europe is making progress.
We call this 'enhanced cooperation'.
We should be ashamed of ourselves.
in writing. - I voted for this report.
I am abstaining on this report.
That is why I voted as I did.
EU patenting is of vital importance.
Who will deal with this?
The EU, of course.
I am voting against the report.
The first aspect is solidarity.
We must avoid this at all costs.
There are three areas.
All of this makes our work difficult.
Who will be driving it?
Has that occurred to him?
We shall see.
I have some good arguments for this.
Why is that?
We need more transparency in this area.
We must evaluate what is being done.
I am sorry that I have overrun.
(The President cut off the speaker)

In fact, they are known only too well.
We must do something else.
I personally opposed this.
(Applause)
This is why we need a strong Europe.
China will not do so.
We will have to do that ourselves.
The Americans will not do that.
We will have to highlight the issue.
How can that possibly be the case?
We must focus on that.
It can fail here and also elsewhere.
Now it has reached USD 1.35.
That is the crucial point.
We have known that here the whole time.
Mr President, well, here we go again.
Written statements (Rule 149)
We should be proud of all of this.
Our borders are the European borders.
However, this is obviously not enough.
That is what Parliament has called for.
They were negligent.
Why are you not saying that?
Indeed, it is not an √† la carte menu.
Then some of them apply for asylum.
So let us not pretend otherwise.
Is this humane?
This is urgent, Commissioner.
This is not fair.
We support you fully in that regard.
We need to improve that.
There are long-standing problems.
And we are working with UNHCR.
The legislative acts are on the table.
The debate is closed.
This is, of course, also a priority.
I propose five steps.
No!
The infrastructure is in place.
I do not believe it is.
Yet, Malta cannot extend any further.
However, that is exactly the problem.
We cannot do it all alone, however.
Above all, we must respond quickly.
Could we check?
It would not be so difficult.
Five thousand.
That would also be a good trip to make.
We need a rapid and joint response.
We need a rapid response now.
One thing is clear.
Obviously, immigration will increase.
Today, the problem is in Lampedusa.
We need solidarity.
We are not there yet.
Economic assistance can be provided.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Good supervision: yes!
Hence, not for speculation.
Turning now to the third pillar.
Congratulations, Ria!
So, there is a job that needs doing.
I think she has done a very good job.
Subsidiarity?
What subsidiarity?
Where is the other sixty-odd percent?
(Applause)
That is a generally recognised fact.
The number of pensioners is increasing.
We already have experience of this.
I do not know where Mr de Jong is.
There he is, at the back.
That is not true.
I hope that satisfies you, Mr de Jong.

Falsified medicinal products (debate)
We should have moved faster.
Yet I do not think our work ends there.
Yes, we could have gone further.
What have we achieved?
What else have we achieved?
Could we have gone further?
The answer is yes.
Should we have gone further?
Here I must say no.
We have looked at the safety features.
This is why action was urgently needed.
We have taken a reasonable approach.
I would like to make one final point.
I very much support this regulation.
A lot of work has been done.
Therefore, we have to be pragmatic.
Thank you also for your support.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Annex - Position of the Commission
Amendments:
Question Time (Commission)
This was not the case before.
So this is the situation today.
I have an additional question.
This was welcomed by Board members.
Action has been taken.
There is no question about that.
I believe that is doable.
That would not be a sufficient answer.
Subject: The CE mark
I think the concept is very good.
I would like to make three points.
That is not all.
The figures are very impressive.
How long do you think that would take?
I agree with you that it was very low.
That is unsatisfactory.
I met Baroness Ludford.
That is all I want to say.
I think it should be taken on board.
I mean no disrespect whatsoever to you.
Situation in Albania (debate)
Today, Albania is in political crisis.
The tone in Tirana needs to change.
The dangerous downward spiral must end.
The political crisis must be resolved.
There is no place for cherry-picking.
It is not too late.
I welcome his decision.
We support the action by Mr Lajƒç√°k.
The blame game seemed more important.
Democracy is not 'winner takes all'.
Unfortunately, the impasse persists.
I wish both of them the best of luck.
I hope that this remains the case.
I agree with Mr Belder.
This is what Albania urgently needs.
That is what is needed.
I hope that will not be the case.
I believe that this is important.
It is a pity, but it is a reality.
The street is no place for them.
Is there a way out?
Yes: catharsis.
No we are not.
Why is this?
We have a clear idea of how to do this.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The Commissioner was very careful.
You cited data from 2008 and 2010.
The Commission should look into that.
Why is there this scandal in Bulgaria?
That is the major issue.
The courts were bought and sold.
I doubt it.
Why?
(The President cut off the speaker)
What a difference!
Why are you doing this?
We are opposed to this.
There are other important issues.
The answer is simple.
The very opposite is true.
However, let us not be na√Øve.
No such scandal exists in Bulgaria.
Today's debate is about the truth.
There can be no half-truths.
I wanted to respond to Mr Strasser.
This is simply futile.
If it is not breached, it will not act.
The debate is closed.
World Bank energy strategy (debate)
We have to focus on renewables.
They are democratic.
The same goes for nuclear energy.
We just need to have courage.
There are limits to arrogance.
We must be more democratic.
The situation was unacceptable.
What has happened to all the projects?
There is absolutely nothing there.
The whole thing is embarrassing.
Now it seems that we are well on track.
Most importantly, we should beef up.
The debate is closed.
Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes
Closure of the sitting
Opening of the sitting
Please take the floor, Mr Martonyi.
You have been informed of them.
This is the essence of its credibility.
Yesterday, we discussed Albania.
He spoke of fairness.
That is why we are pressing for this.
The ICTY has been mentioned.
This is very serious.
Our concerns are not artificial.
Media freedom is also under assault.
Secondly, there is the corruption.
That is my sincere wish.
The process must continue.
The people of Europe have misgivings.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 149)
We must be open to new Member States.
Thank you.
Œ§he next item is the joint debate on
This is the Europe 2020 Strategy.
However, I want to be clear on this.
What do we mean by this governance?
We need financing of these projects.
What exactly is your recommendation?
To cut public expenditure!
There is no talk of revenues.
However, that is not all.
We must strike soon and strike hard.
Have they promoted the single market?
Have they encouraged enterprise?
Have they encouraged online trading?
They should get down to work!
Nobody wants that.
These attacks must stop.
How else are we going to compete?
There is inconsistency here.
What does this mean?
However, we must try.
Job vacancies need specialised labour.
We must succeed.
Words are not enough.
We need action.
What are we going to do?
We must focus on people.
You have given us a lot of fine words.
You are wrong.
There is no alternative to that.
I agree with that, in itself.
That is a very bad idea.
It will be a job killer.
That is rather dishonest.
Or have we obstructed it?
Where and when will they find work?
Where and when?
I expect a concrete answer.
Problems might very well arise.
This is the case at the moment.
How are we to understand this?
We need the regions of Europe.
People and workers must be respected.
That is not the right way to go.
This lesson has to be learned.
Again we have to be aware of diversity.
Just to mention two things briefly.
There were major shifts in competences.
We all know about them.
We will strictly abide by that.
Now my last remark is very short.
It is about the money.
I could not agree more.
There will be a long debate.
The debate is closed.
(FR) We have taken note of your point.
Thank you very much.

Mr President, I welcome this report.

I am therefore voting for this report.
That is why I voted as I did.






What is a falsified medicinal product?
Falsified medicines are silent killers.
I welcome the results of today's vote.
This must change.
This can have very sad consequences.
They are almost incomparable.
We must not repeat previous mistakes.
I hope this will happen soon.
I abstained from this vote.
I want to see Zagreb take action.
It allows them to be heard.
Rising food prices (debate)
This is a pressing issue.
Thank you very much for your attention.
I think we should remember this.
(Applause)
(Applause)
I very much welcome that.
We are only at 3% of the 2008 level.
Hundreds of farms have gone bankrupt.
This is a whole new ball game.
We have seen that in recent days.
Hopefully we can find a way to do that.

What is the EU doing about this?
The signs are worrying.
So, food security is our priority.
(The President cut off the speaker)
How is this possible?
Where does the money go?
We have to learn how to do that.
Now it is importing food.
There is an answer to all this.
People said that India would starve.
India did not starve.
Brazil is now self-sufficient in food.
We can do it if we have the will.
Neither route would be wise.
(The President cut off the speaker)
There is no defence for this obscenity.
What can we say to them today?
Did we learn from this?
My answer is that we did not.
We are still limiting production.
We talk about stability.
Where are these reserves to come from?
Who will pay for them?
It is good that ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
What was the result?
This should be a lesson for all of us.
It is not the way forward.
Only then will we have sensible prices.
They are waiting, however.
I have taken note of this issue.
The debate is closed.

Situation in Egypt (debate)

He was not a dictator then.
We cannot delay.

That is a debate for another time.
Do you think that is in good taste?
What does it mean?
But what else does it mean?
Islam and democracy do not mix.
The people can do it!
It will be difficult.
He is absolutely right.
They played a fundamental role.
He said, 'Of course I am.
But there are problems.
We need much more time.
We need to reward reform.
I still am.
Proposals have been made.
Beware! Nothing has ended.
It is all just starting.
New challenges and new prospects.
The question is what is Europe doing?
What can it do and what must it do?
Will we succeed or will we fail?
Time is running out.
Lampedusa is calling us.
I would appreciate your views.
Commissioner, can you do this?
Where was our joy?
They were crushed.
One young student was killed.
The first solution we propose is money.

Number one: balanced coverage.
I mentioned four areas.

Number three: media registration.
Number four: offensive content.
I will announce details quite soon.
Commissioner, of course we welcome it.
We cannot all be politically motivated.
You must be deeply unhappy about that.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Just look at Poland's experience.
(PL) Thank you for your question.
There is no question about that.
That cannot be right.
That is, I think, a touch pathetic.
There is still no source protection.
It is not a pleasant feeling.
We do not have the time.
What a life!
I will be brief, Commissioner.
I wish there was the time.
They do not operate in a legal vacuum.
That is a major success.
It is misleading.
You are the heirs of S√°ndor M√°rai.
You are the heirs of Imre Kert√©sz.
So do not let us down!
We have a combination of factors.
Let us not be naive.
So do not underestimate your own role.

So there is no doubt about that.
That will be done as soon as possible.

Now that is exactly what happened.

Significant synergies can be achieved.

Are human rights being respected?
Is there freedom of the press?
Are entrepreneurs able to act freely?
Are there free trade unions?

We need to look closely at this.
Thank you, Madam President.
No one has even been caught.

Thank you.
That figure today is barely 1.12%.

So whom do we owe it to?
That is not acceptable.
Time to step on the gas.
These are the facts.
This is how things stand at present.
What can we do?
I think that we can do it.
We have the power.
(Applause)
Such a period is upon us again.
Quotas are called for.
You talk about maternity leave.
So you have done them no favours.
And now you are talking about quotas.
What kind of madness is this?
(Applause)
(Applause)
Poverty is a female issue.
That is why we need quotas.
There has been no action since then.
We want equal pay now.
I do not think that this is the case.
We need a quota.
They are the ones without a voice.
You may ask why.
This is warped, but very interesting.
This is an insult to women.
That is not necessary.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
(Applause)

Thank you for your contributions.

Thank you for that.
The Trotskyists grew older, if not up.

Many concrete actions are possible.
I agree with Mrs Zimmer.
That is absolutely fundamental.
This is part of our decent work agenda.

This is true.
This is the main challenge facing us.
Thank you very much.
Poverty and the European Union.

This is intolerable and has to change.
(Applause)
We must also have women in the banks.
That is not democracy.

Explanations of vote
Oral explanations of vote
Thank you very much.
That is why we voted in favour of it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
This is exactly what we saw.
Not tax evasion, but tax neutrality.
Shame on this EU imperialism!
Thank you.
We can help by opening up our markets.
It is time to trust the consumers.
Infer from what has happened.
This means self-sufficiency.
I, too, voted against its adoption.
I followed his example on this matter.
Thank you very much.
I therefore say 'no' to quotas.
Despite measures, inequality persists.
Women are well educated.
We have a very long way to go.
Take, first, the expense.
This will cost an extra billion pounds.
Thirdly, take the bad faith.
However, we have not valued it.
Written explanations of vote
This has been pointed out to Mr Brok.
I shall vote against.
I am voting in favour of this report.
That is why we voted in favour.
This is why I voted for this report.
I voted in favour of this report.
The response was disproportionate.
They are much less exotic.
I voted in favour of this document.
That must not be allowed in any case.
It was misguided, however.
Europeans know when to be pragmatic.
It is enough to drive one to despair.
It should therefore lead the way.
That is unacceptable, in our opinion.
However, the fight is not over.
We cannot accept this carbon tax.
I voted 'for'.
This is only fair.
The report is a step in this direction.
Thank you.
I fully support a genuine Tobin tax.
The march towards equality goes on.
Words are therefore not enough!

Hence, I voted against this report.
I voted for that report.
We do not share this point of view.
There is no room for compromise here.




I am voting against this report.
I voted for Mrs Joly's report.
I therefore voted in favour of it.
On the contrary, it defends it.
We consider this to be unacceptable.
We need and demand free trade in goods.
I am aware of that.
I am voting against the report.
For these reasons, I abstained.
That is why I abstained.
We have voted in favour.
Thank you.

The Ha√ºsling report was a good one.
The downward spiral has already begun.
I therefore voted against this report.
This policy must be overturned.
There have also been many victories.
It is your right.
The EU is made up of men and women.
67).

Allow me to briefly state my own.
I voted in favour of this report.
I supported this report.
I voted in favour of this text.
Women are in a difficult situation.
I voted in favour of this report.
I voted in favour.

I therefore voted against this report.
I voted in favour of this report.
The final result is also OK.
I thank you for your attention.
I know exactly how far we have come.
I have witnessed this at company level.
Let us not miss this opportunity!
This is great.
This is no way to rescue the euro.
I do not know.
Do you know what Moody's says?
Where will this eventually end?
In the safety net, of course.
However, an imbalance exists there.
What does the word 'pact' mean?
A pact is an agreement between States.
Secondly, there is the approach.
We must use the Community approach.
My request is a very simple one.
This must be done now.
This would mean sustainable growth.
Mr Barroso, you must stop Mr Oettinger.
This will certainly be necessary.
Why is this?
They are both clever strategists.
I expect transparency in this matter.
It cannot be done without information!
That is not democracy!
Nobody has voted for that.
Mr Barroso knows that himself.
Is this not a Union of nations?
A very proud one, I might add?
We have made many over the years.
You are quite right.
You are right.
That should not go unmentioned.
I should just like to use three words.
The third word is 'effectiveness'.
That is the Lisbon strategy!
We will get on with our work.
However, what do the markets seek?
That is the reality.
It is an important point.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Why exclude the willing and able?

This therefore gives us an opportunity.
That is what is at stake.

2010 progress report on Turkey (debate)
Let me highlight some of these areas.
The EU-Turkey relationship is strong.
Getting the laws right is important.
Let me turn to the issue of migration.
Thirdly, minority rights.
However, dialogue alone is not enough.
Fourthly, women's rights.
I have visited women's shelters.
That has to change.
Sixthly, foreign policy.
The Commissioner has spoken about this.
We must show respect for one another.
All of this is very good.
That surely cannot be the case!
Now, everyone can see that it is not.
Let us get moving!
Let us not lose Turkey at this stage!
It is already 2011.
Mr Sarkozy has already said that.
Picking on Cyprus leads Turkey nowhere.
What was he expecting to find?
Words do not mean much'.
We know that this is what is happening.
We need to find other methods.
We face a giant strategic crisis.
That is what we expect from you.
Both sides have their homework to do.
However, one thing is clear.
We are already witnessing that.
Press freedom is a major concern.
We should remember this.
Thank you.
Let us not forget that.
(Applause)
No, not yet.
Is Europe ready for Turkey?
No, not yet.
No, no yet.
We therefore need a clearer position.
This should be guaranteed by law.
Time is running away.
The law is still in place.
But let me make it absolutely clear.
Let me make a personal comment.
Let me be frank with you.
Europe has now turned somewhat inward.
There is an enlargement weariness.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
There is a simple reason for this.
There is a growing political consensus.
That is abundantly clear.
Problems remain, of course.
I believe that this will be achieved.
The other is minority issues.
Thank you very much.
The debate is closed.
EU strategy on Roma inclusion (debate)
(Applause)
(Applause)
In their words, it is work in progress.
You have our support.
(Applause)
This is about more than funding.

What is it all about?
We must speak with one voice.
This is not just a minority issue.

Integration is not a one-way street.
Now, that is really crazy.
That also applies to the Social Fund.
We have to help them to move forward.
I am very grateful for this.
The debate is closed.

Subject: Energy-saving light bulbs
This is the situation at the moment.
I am pleased about this.
Things often get broken.
Subject: Victims' rights packages
Part two
That is the plan.
If so, why?
(DA) Thank you Commissioner.
Thank you.
It has been a difficult afternoon.
It continues to be a difficult evening.
Eurobonds?
The European growth bond?
All of the above?
Or perhaps something else?
What, Commissioner?
Who decided?
Who decided that, Madam President?
I do not understand that.
That is why.
That is the reality.
I will be very brief.
You are right.
That is the simple answer.
I am sorry.
That concludes Question Time.
What does having modern industry mean?

(Applause)
That is the central message.
I think the answer is yes.
These are two key issues.
These two things go hand in hand.
I will mention just some of them.
Industrial policy is making a comeback.
These three form the core.
What must we do?
The third is funding.
I have a suggestion to make.
I share the view on monetary policies.
This is not a European veto.
It will continue.
Secondly, material management.

Several articles focus on these issues.
This is good news.
We need practical, sensible measures.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The next item is the debate on:
There are a number of reasons for this.
Firstly, the WTO.
Is there a role for Greenland?
What is planned in this respect?
Substitution is another key factor.
This must not continue.
We need an international agreement.
This is known as the 'colonial reflex'.
Is it your Directorate-General?
Is it you?
Is it Mr De Gucht?
Is it the other commissioners?
Who really has overall responsibility?
What concrete steps must be taken?
(Applause)
That is very important.
We need to increase collection.
Will you look at that issue as well?
That seems to me to be very important.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
We take note of and welcome that.
I am interested to hear your answers.
What can we see?
We can also see air pollution.
And you talk of social acceptability?
There is genuine rebellion.
But whom does this gas benefit?
Are we talking about cui bono?
A pipeline is rather like a marriage.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for your attention.
Just one example of this is mobility.
Why is this?
This makes it clear that we need gas.
This process is only just beginning.
Why might this be the case?
I do not distrust them.
That is true in all areas.
The debate is closed.

(Applause)
(Applause)
However, we are not a military union.
We are facing an enormous challenge.
We cannot speak of a uniform process.
Gaddafi is a criminal.
That is what our consciences say to us.
That would be dangerous.
What they need is a no-fly zone.
Let us be frank.
For years, we have failed to do that.
Mazel tov!
Are you serious?
(Applause)
Today, a nation has risen up.
It has representatives.
Two things are needed.
Therefore, it is not NATO.
How can it be achieved?
There are countless ideas.
There are options.
(Applause)
Everyone was in agreement.
We should let them come to Europe!
(Applause)
That has not happened, of course.
This has been spoken of clearly here.
That is a fact!
Resolute action is needed now.
We certainly do not want that.
Thank you very much.
Firstly, the humanitarian emergency.
A civil war is taking place in Libya.
You do not have to hug them.
You do not have to charm them.
We have to recognise them.
In a few days, a summit is to be held.
We expect it to produce results.
We often say the right things here.
Our problem is that we are slow to act.
Thank you.
This is also obviously going to happen.
We must help them achieve this.
What is needed is transport.
The catch-the-eye procedure begins now.
Please excuse me therefore.
You also spoke about violence.
How will you change them?
How will they be changed?
Thank you and good luck.
We are right behind you.
But there is much more to do.
Of course.
There are pictures of many people.
No, let us not do that.
She has not replied on that point.
Many speakers have raised it.
That is our question.
I am not trying to avoid the issue.
Let this not be a crisis.
I am not avoiding anything.
The debate is closed.
Europe must act on two fronts:
It was a principle of solidarity.
It is roughly equal.
Who shall establish them and how?
Why do we need this legal certainty?
It is critical that we get it right.
All the speakers agreed with him.
Dear oh dear!
It is a complete disaster.
There is no mandate, Mr Duff.
There is no mandate for this.
And I am, by god!
I was right in spades, was I not?
(Applause)
I think that would be a grave mistake.
I respect the people.
I do not fear the people.
Recently, there has been a respite.
This is not such a wild idea.
The IMF does it.
Members from my group are concerned.
What about moral hazard issues?
Why is this?
No, quite the contrary in fact.
Thank you for giving me the floor.
That is not the case.
Thank you, Mr President.
That is the starting point.
That would be a sensible approach.
Mr President, I have three points.
It is a rescue mechanism.
That is what we asked for.
Thank you.
Realism has today led us to revise it.
I have drawn two conclusions from this.
I will try to do this now.
To conclude, just one sentence.
I believe we will achieve it.

I supported this resolution.
We therefore did not vote in favour.
We therefore did not vote in favour.
That is why I voted as I did.
I voted in favour of this resolution.
The text is very balanced.
These are the facts.
Turkey is a strong economic actor.
This cannot be ignored.
Such lectures are inappropriate.
There are other fundamental issues.
Further steps are necessary, however.
I voted in favour of this resolution.
This time, it is Montenegro's turn.
Now the promises are huge.
We must not underestimate this.
I want no part of it.
I shall vote against.
Roma inclusion is a matter for Europe.
The EU funds are there.
Parliament has adopted a good text.
We are afraid of what we do not know.
This confused approach is unacceptable.
Integration is not a one-way street.
I therefore voted against the report.
I voted in favour of this report.
There is no miracle solution to this.
That is why we voted against.
I therefore voted in favour.
EU approach towards Iran (debate)
Iran's response was disappointing.
I saw that in the case of Ms Ashtiani.
I look forward to this debate.
We have made wide-ranging offers.
Why do we have to do so?
The list can go on.
It is incredible and hard to believe.
It is the right line to take.
I will make that my last point.
I suggest we consider this.
What can we do about this?
Today would not be soon enough!
That is not democracy, Ms Ashton.
I repeat that this is about democracy.
I represent five million people.
I have been elected here.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is possible but less probable.
It is for them to choose.
For me, it is identical.
The debate is closed.
But in the end, these are only inputs.
What truly matter are the outputs.
We look forward to working with her.
It has, rightfully, been removed.
This is a very important precedent.
They can indeed.
(The President interrupted the speaker)
Thank you.
(The President interrupted the speaker)
Very well.
We should not be fatalists, however.
Thank you very much.
It is because she is a woman.
Yesterday was Women's Day.
This was not raised here.
This House disgraced itself.
Not to fund coercive abortion.
We need to be fair and consistent.
This is a breach of their human rights.
That is not by accident.
I think that is probably right.
One is resources, inevitably.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Regrettably, this is not the reality.
This is clearly unacceptable.
You spoke about this.
It also had a beneficial effect.

You spoke about direct negotiations.
You gave me the answer.
There must be an end to both.
Now they have collapsed.
Settlement development must be stopped.
I hope that we recognise the elections.
We are trying to help.
We have discussed Libya today.
I should like to make this very clear.
Democratisation must succeed here too.
The Arab peoples are watching us.
That child's parents want peace.
They also want the settlements to stop.
Simply to stop them.
Not to dismantle them. To stop them.
Quite something!
She is right, of course.
Israel has played for time.
What is this about?
That word is 'no'.
We must do the same for the Ark Royal.
I dedicate those words to Mrs Ashton.
I am sick of it.
I have heard it enough.
Our position is absolutely clear.
I was very well aware of that.
That will be for them to decide.
I think it had two effects.
We have to get moving.
There are two reasons for this.
I think it is the interests of both.
I will see him again in Cairo.
We need to get further and faster.
I do not mind where we meet the envoys.
For me, that really matters.
I appreciate that.
So, getting that to happen mattered.

That could work.
It can work, too.
This concerns all European citizens.

We need to be clear about that.
In all this chaos, one thing was clear.
As you see, nothing actually worked.
If there are any, what might they be?
What is the alternative plan?
What means of transport are to be used?

However, the debate is far from over.
I am therefore voting in favour.
That is the wrong way to go.

This is where the problem lies.
I was especially pleased about that.
First let me mention the sanctions.
I will stop there.
This is the principle of 11 March 2011.
Without investments there is no growth.
This is our duty as neighbours.
(Applause)
It starts with Libya.
Many congratulations!
At this juncture we need to take stock.
We do not need to help them'.
Four months later: a bail-out.
'We do not need a rescue package.
'We do not want Eurobonds.
Eurobonds are nonsense.'
Now everyone is discussing Eurobonds.
Perhaps in four months' time.
'We do not need economic governance.
That is the reality.
There is a crucial difference.
We have embarked upon the wrong course.
The euro is a strong currency.
Look at what it is worth today.
(Applause)
These are not my words.
What does it say?
The Council holds all the power.
I know they will say no.
They always say no.
This goes against the Treaty of Lisbon.
Did they do this?
Is that the EU's position?
We must not let this happen again.
That is clear.
Our fellow citizens know all this.
They know this and they sense it.
We need to start somewhere.
We must focus on young people.

That is what we must now stop.
This indebtedness must end.
I share this view.
We must now look to the future.
My second question is as follows.
Thank you for giving me the floor.
Major deficits have not been tackled.
Thank you.
We have a Stability and Growth Pact.
That is unbelievable.
We need to follow two steps.
This is the second symbol of tomorrow.
The EU has also been involved in this.
On the contrary, they came too late.
The West waited too long.
And what did we see?
My congratulations!
Reagan was right all along.
We must not make any mistakes here.
(Applause)
Are we aware?
They are wrong.
This reduces my country's influence.
This is the free world of the USA.

My second point is Libya.
What is the quid pro quo?
After all, they are our neighbours.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is a real success story.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is what we must put an end to.
This is why we need joint solutions.
Is there such a thing as good debt?
This is a very exciting debate.
It is not an exclusive club.
We are not one hundred per cent united.
Thank you very much, Madam President.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 149)
Let us just get on with it.
Our support to Japan needs to continue.
I have two comments on this.
We have expressed our deep sympathy.
We respect that.
Secondly, safety.
This is the situation for our part.
This is happening all over Europe.
We need two other steps.
Are we to do this through stress tests?
A choice will have to be made.
Thank you.
There must be absolute transparency.
We should find out what happened.
What will be the consequences then?
Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you for listening.
Thank you.
I would disagree, however.
(Heckling)
I suggest you do the same.
(Heckling)
(Interruption by Mrs Harms)
These are two different issues.
There have been no changes.
I have one final point to make.
They both belong to the same party.
I respect that.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 149)
The next item is the debate on
How important is it?
We did our homework.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We have already lost one year.
The issue is too important.
That is our purpose.
Obviously we refer to global needs.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
I am finishing, Mr President.
The EU can and should help here.
We are losing time every day.
Children, women, innocent civilians.
What will happen after that?
Who will provide them with jobs?
What about social tensions?
Shame on you!
Thank you very much.
That is what is happening, Mrs Enik≈ë.
I will mention three.
I view this as problematic.
I do not think that it is so.
Let us talk about it and consult.
There is a very real need for it.
Let us try to come to an agreement.
Thank you very much.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The debate is closed.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
So that is how the law stands today.
So what are we going to do about this?
That is not the problem.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I think that is wrong.
However, privacy has its limits.
That is a really ambitious programme.
I hope we can achieve that.
It will need a lot of negotiation.
The debate is closed.
Consumer rights (debate)
Thank you for your cooperation.
It should be worthy of that name.
For example, Amendment 141.
We have come a long way.
We have reviewed the consumer acquis.
We may make some small steps forward.
I think we have a serious problem here.
That picture is wrong.
The initial draft was a bad one.
The result was monstrous.
Today's world is evidently different.
Quite the opposite is true.
Therefore it is good progress.
I have a general thought.
Thank you very much.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 149)
What are the timelines?
This is indisputable.
Thank you for the very clear message.

Generalised tariff preferences (debate)

It is not at all selective.
We are thoroughly reviewing it.
Preferences alone are not enough.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 149)
One-minute speeches (Rule 150)
They want autonomy.
A great deal of precision is required.
Legislation is not strictly regulated.

What is the content of the agreement?
I am referring here to cabotage.
Thank you very much for your attention.
I am looking forward to the debate.
I will start with Vietnam.
This is the least complex agreement.
I would like to make one more point.
Nevertheless, we have climbed down.
We finally need to make this clear.
I would like to say just one thing.
They are clearly marked by ideology.
This is nothing new.


Thank you for your comments.
The joint debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 149)
Preparation of 2012 budget (debate)
These tasks will not do themselves.
It is not just about monies.
Where do we need to spend more money?
This is what my group is opposing.
First of all, austerity.
Thus, this is also a difficult task.
We can, however, talk about principles.
Thank you for your attention.
However, let us not delude ourselves.
Let us not be mistaken.
The same thing is happening in Europe.
Thank you for your attention.
However, there is still time.
It should be like that.
She was talking about cutting it.
This is not surprising.
This is our credibility.
This is really about our credibility.
This is about cohesion.

The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11:30.

Explanations of vote
The next item is explanations of vote.
Bad debt has become citizens' debt.
Nobody is prepared to face reality.
The debt is unsustainable.
What we need is major restructuring.
We do not benefit from a weaker euro.
This, however, would be a disgrace.
We should set an example.
I therefore supported this report.
Written explanation of vote
I therefore voted 'for'.
He must now keep that promise.
It also requires substantial reform.
I therefore voted 'for'.
That is why I voted in favour.
Such an Agreement was a necessity.
That is why we voted against.
We must support them.
Let us take Iran as an example.
We therefore voted against.
There can be no exceptions.
1.

3.
That is why I have abstained.
I therefore supported it.
I voted in favour of this report.
I fully agree with Prof. Monti.
Consumer protection is very important.
The message is clear.
We cannot ignore it.
We cannot leave things as they are.
The EU must act now.
I welcome the first reading agreement.
The European Parliament,
Japan is overwhelmed today.
Japan has urgent need of aid.
We have areas of seismic activity.
So much for solidarity!

(Applause)
I will give you a few examples of this.
He has to countersign the letter.
We had very many debates.
That goes without saying.
What is today's debate actually about?
Look at Italy, look at Lampedusa.
It is defamatory towards these people.
I would ask you to reprimand him.
I did not speak about barbarians.
I would like that to be corrected.
Europe must not become a fortress.

This is a very good start.
We are colegislators.
The debate is closed.
Dual-use items and technology (debate)
That was not the case, however.
We must ensure that that is the case.
I now look forward to the debate.
Dual-use items are not niche goods.
That is incorrect.
We must combat this imbalance.
That should not be the case.
This is also important.
The debate is closed.
European statistics on tourism (debate)




I welcome this report.
Statistics are absolutely vital.


Thank you very much.
Now I give the floor to Mrs Meissner.
You have one minute.
That sounds so boring.
I do not find it at all boring.
This report helps us with that.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)

Thank you.
That is one picture of this violence.
Here are some more images.
She still has a little way to go.
She is attacked and raped.
What I say is: we have had enough.
It cannot go on.
I ask all of you to say likewise.
Violence is not a private matter.
Thank you very much.
It is high time to put an end to this.
Thank you very much.
Let us take one example: rape.
This is why a directive is necessary.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Some do not have any at all.
Composition of Parliament: see Minutes
The next item is the joint debate on:
Where is Europe?
It is time to stop talking.
They cannot cope alone.
We have four funds.
They cannot cope alone.
Who can cope?
It is not showing solidarity.
Let us not be the man of yesterday.
Let us be today's institution.
I believe in solidarity.
(Applause)
You are just allowing all of that!
Even the UN cannot do this.
This is an opportunity to build Europe.
Every corner of this Europe is Europe.
I congratulate Mr Provera.
What a disgrace!
It is time to act, Commissioner.
This brings us to the report.
The joint debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)

You are mistaken.

He died at the scene.
What happened to change this position?
Is there any sign of growth?
Don't let his death be in vain'.
It goes far beyond this.
In my opinion, this is not right.

Closure of the sitting
Opening of the sitting
(The sitting was opened at 09:05)
You will find them in the conclusions.
I have a final remark on the economy.
Not at all.
Not all our problems are over.
We showed common determination.
A massive bloodbath has been avoided.
Thousands of lives have been saved.
Gaddafi must go.
This must stop on all sides.
We must be consistent in our position.
That is a top priority.
I look forward to hearing your views.
We also discussed the nuclear question.
That is how we will build Europe.
(Applause)
You mentioned Libya.
(Applause)
This is no way to take Europe forward.
(Applause)
What do we tell the banks?
Look at Brazil.
And the worst is still to come.
And have we solved the crisis?
No, we have not solved the crisis.
I think Nout Wellink is right.
The first is the EFSF and the ESM.
Is there real economic governance?
We all know that will take money.
How will we do that?
Where is the money?
We should not be taken for fools.
Do not be telling us little stories.
We know what the problems are.
We are not here to waste our time.
That much is true.
That is how it translates for them.
Look at the banks' profits.
Look at the massive pay packets.
Turning to Libya now.
Zilch!
Nothing!
Did you think about that?
I have not read anything in the papers.
And finally, I turn to Japan.
That is what has happened in Japan.
We say 'no' to such a union.
We do not support such a union.
I say that is not what we need.
At the European level again.
My third point relates to Japan.
(NL) Mr Barroso, you will get your way.
Where will that money come from?
How is the fund to be made up?
The euro cannot be rescued in this way.
I want to see results.
That is the reality.
I must concur with Mr Verhofstadt.
Is this European justice?

This is serious.
Let us talk about revenue.
You talk to us about stress tests.
Those last year were a joke.
Be serious!
(Applause)
It is unjust and it is undemocratic.
But what is the European quid pro quo?
Why is the European budget being cut?
I want you to mark my words.
As a Finn, I regret that.
Thank you very much.
However, you are still welcome to try.
There is no escaping this.
The second topic is nuclear power.
There is therefore a game to be played.
Madam President, that will not succeed.
Well done!
This is fine if it is a one-off.
Infinitely much more is at stake.
(Applause)
The war in Libya goes on.
You are consistent.
Did you penalise them for doing that?
This is not the European Union we want.
These are the new talking shops.
Perhaps we will suggest it.
That is not the case.
But is this all talk?
It is time to walk the walk.
They call on us to choose growth.
I certainly do.
Extreme positions are being adopted.
It is primarily a conservative success.
Its implementation depends on unity.
Whoever stays out misses out.
You are mistaken!
We wish you every success in this.
It is sad, but true.
No one can be against that.

Thank you in advance for your answers.
What has Japan taught us?
What are we doing?
We are accusing Japan of negligence.
My third point concerns EU-NATO.
Let us aim to be successful this time.
That goal is to secure stable growth.
It is therefore possible.
Thank you for your attention.
What we should do is use it.
However, we should be careful.
(The President cut off the speaker)
But is protection enough on its own?
Is it not necessary to go further?
Please answer this question for me.
I have a question about each.
Whatever does this mean?
It could only mean one thing.
This was rejected by our Member States.
That is the reality.
However, it was rejected.
(Applause)
It was not easy, however.
That is the situation.
Let us be absolutely clear.
And we have to fight for that.
That responsibility is essential.
Let us be honest, once again.
They will not agree.
The same goes for the CCCTB.
Let us not confuse cause and effect.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Are our governance measures too weak?
We need to be self-critical there.
No!
Should we do more?
Of course we should.
Not at all!
It must be developed further.
Yet we acted in time!
Did we get things wrong in the past?
Did we adopt the right policies?
No!
Did we correct our mistakes?
Yes!
(Applause)
I want to be very clear on this.

The next item is the vote.
Explanations of vote
This is what we need to do.
Italy is a pressure cooker right now.
There is also the desire for freedom.
We can help in some ways.
What do they do then?
They seek to migrate.
We have to get this right.
Why?
That is a sign of poor planning.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Freeze all new reactors being designed.
Obviously, there are some difficulties.
We must focus our attention on this.
We therefore voted in favour.
That cost more in public services.
It is a crime to be persecuted.
We need to break the silence.
That is what we are doing in Sweden.
A strong signal must be sent this day.

Written explanations of vote
I therefore voted in favour of this.
There are reasons for migration flows.
This report is arrogant and brutal.
I am voting against it.
I welcome this report.
Thank you.
Well, who would vote against it?
How unspecified and populist it is!
Lack of efficient healthcare!
'Possible funding' is well said.
I therefore voted in favour of this.
in writing. - I welcome this report.
I voted 'for'.
Each of these applies within the EU.
in writing. - I voted for this report.
That is a minimum.
I have therefore abstained from voting.
I voted in favour of this report.
This is why I supported it.
So let us respect women's rights, too.
We cannot remain inactive, however.
My group is divided on the matter.
in writing. - I voted for this report.
I voted 'for'.
We need to work on this area.
Documents received: see Minutes
Mr Oettinger, it is nice to see you.
I found this very interesting.
So why not intervene straight away?
This is a national competence.
Why should this be?
Why have we set such high limits?
My question relates to Euratom.
Are Member States ready to go forward?
Help me.
What is the EU's policy on Libya?
That is what she has been saying.
We have to recognise this.
She is a very committed European.
We have many colleagues on the list.
If so, how do you propose doing this?
What measures could it take?
That is my question.
There is a fundamental issue here.
I am sure you have children.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is what common sense tells us.
We are serious about this.
But what is happening at EU level?
This is what is causing confusion.
That concludes the item.
These are as follows.
What is next?
This is what was agreed.
There is no gender perspective.
I think so.
She sold her own little girl.
Others send them to do other things.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 149)
Why youth?
Is that what we really want?
No, this is the wrong decision.
Use the tram.
It will be a museum anyway.
This report provides no vision.
This is too crazy for words!
I think that we should do more.
We must start work on this review.
It is perhaps time that someone did.
I am pleased about that.
I do not think I need to go on.
Basically I agree with him.
I also wanted to go further.
We can make more savings.
There is no doubt about that.
Does this project make sense?
Should a parliament operate a museum?
No, definitely not.
We are very frequent travellers.
Thank you very much.
That is the only solution.
Parliament has new powers.
One more word on the issue of youth.

The debate is closed.
The situation is improving.
Thank you for your attention.
We need one-stop transparency.
This will yield us EUR 500 million.
This is really a very important point.
Well, this is intolerable.
Thank you very much for your attention.
This system needs further improvement.
This is also evident in the report.
We are fighting corruption.
Secondly, the clarity of regulations.
Defrauders must be punished.
There is a very distinct difference.
Let us not terrorise the individual.
Many fellow Members raised the issue.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 149)
Question Time (Commission)
How do you plan to address this issue?
So we have to respect that.
Until then we have to wait, I'm afraid.
Subject: Enabling technologies
Subject: Future of EU fishing industry
The fact is that we do not know.
We are very vulnerable.
This is something we want to do.
That is why we need this reform.
Subject: Proposed ban on shark finning
It is inhumane; it is barbaric.
Dumped back into the sea, they die.
It is a practice that should be banned.
I appreciate that it is very difficult.
How do you police it?
The figures speak for themselves.
It is a very lucrative business indeed.
We need to ban it completely.
We should take the lead in that regard.
In 2003, shark-fin fishing was banned.
So what actions can be taken on that?
That way we can retain control.
This is why all this happens.
This is something we have in mind.
So we have to be productive on this.
I am referring to Western Sahara.
SMEs need support on their doorstep.
Subject: Air pollution in German cities
Munich is one of these zones.
I have two brief additional questions.
That is the issue in this respect.
Subject: EU Biodiversity Strategy
What progress has been made?
What are the deadlines there?
How are we progressing there?
What are you planning to do on this?
There is one thing I would like to add.
We are talking about biodiversity.
Subject: Waste management in Greece
This issue has not been resolved yet.

That concludes Question Time.
Thank you, Mr President.
We must therefore act urgently.
I come now to the core of my argument.
We have tried it in the European Union.
Would you agree with me, Mr Agnew?
No, of course we do not.
That is why we are here.
This is very serious.
My party is specific to Corsica.
This provision is to be deplored.
I was not.
That causes me terrible worries.
In any case we feel seriously excluded.
That is not very many.
Well done!
Is that what Europe wants?
Does it want to buy its way to power?
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 149)
Who will determine this interest?
Parliament?
The Commission?
That is called a free mandate.
The next item is the joint debate on:
- C7-0107/2010 - and
- C7-0282/2010 - and

There is growing dissatisfaction.
I hope we will be successful on that.
That will be okay with us.
The committee approved this agreement.
This does not bode well.
Thank you.
I am raising the issue again today.
I find this incredible.
That is what we are here to do.

That is the first project.
More trade will benefit all.
There we are.
This is true.
I strongly agree with this idea.
Thank you very much, Mr President.


I would like to make one more comment.
That is abundantly clear.
We have top lawyers here.
We are creating great laws.
Announcement by the President
The situation is very grave.
I turn now to the second statement.
We all have a lot to do.
Thank you for informing us about this.
(Applause)
We appreciate these three measures.
The Single Market is our goal.
But here ends the debate.
The first aspect concerns competition.

The list consists of four key points.
You need our help.
Well, so am I.
Small business is the victim here.
In today's texts, we have this.
This must stop.
It should become easy to comprehend.
Europe must continue to harmonise.
Thank you, Mr President.
Let us take it.
Now is the time for action.
You should make it lovable.
Citizens use public services.
I was in China a few days ago.
We must also be realistic.
It is time to act.
The debate is closed.

I will never join a pan-European party.
What does it boil down to in essence?

I think it is a step forward.

There is a proposal for a moratorium.
Both of these things are possible.
It is not just about earthquakes.
We no longer want to use fossil fuels.
We want jobs in trade and industry.
We must be fully aware of this.
I think that we are all aware of that.
How should we do this?
Claude mentioned 15 years.
We have to be aware of this.
Reliability and safety are improved.
Can I not have equal treatment?
First Chernobyl, then Fukushima.
Where next?
I stand by what I have said.
We all agree on that.

How should we look to the future?
Thank you for your attention.
The unthinkable has happened.
There is no such thing as zero risk.

May I continue?
There were three questions.
The Kr≈°ko nuclear power plant.
May I?
The consequences are too long-lasting.
(Applause)
We need limits for food from Japan.
I have one question for the Commission.
They do exist.
One more point: they create new jobs.
Now it is a solar power station.
Why is this?

Situation in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen





Today, I saw a Syrian dissident.
Their stories were appalling.
It made me angry.
It is time to take action.
You had nothing to contribute today.
Therefore, we must be clear.
Now to Yemen.
How are we going to achieve that?
It may be asked: what can the EU do?

Written statements (Rule 149)
The timing is totally up to them.
I believe this is a timely call.
Reform is a good thing in any case.
I personally shall do so.
Let us be honest.
Why is this interest important?
This is only the beginning.
However, there is one difference.
It is a critical issue indeed.
It is they who must find this solution.
Thank you very much, Mr President.

Situation in C√¥te d'Ivoire
Mr President, I am confused now.
Was that action justified?
Perhaps.
Whose interest is this in?
There are three speakers.
The question is: what comes next?
It is time to put a stop to this.
The debate is closed.
Thank you very much for your attention.
It is vital that this happens.
What is the situation like today?
(The President cut off the speaker)
This really is an excellent approach.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I agree with that.
Unquote.
Was that perhaps a na√Øve idea?
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Development has been slow.
I disagree.
I repeat: diversified.
These are scandalous practices.
It is certainly needed.
That has cost us in trust for Europe.
It also includes the East.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
I agree with that.
Will you take it into consideration?
These are huge things.
But then the Arab Revolution came.
Many of them still need to be answered.
I do not think so.
It is not going to be an easy process.
Many of you talked about money.
The logic here is very clear.
But is it only about money?
Absolutely not.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)

EIB annual report for 2009 (debate)
I think that we are.
It is a good example.
China has learnt that.
EIB assistance was essential.
We know how important that is today.
Yes, but with a triple A rating.
Are these proposals 'unacceptable'?
There, too, a public bank is vital.
Mrs Goulard spoke about this just now.
Has he considered this at all?
That is what we would like to know.
The EIB has a critical role to play.
We therefore need to promote Eurobonds.
(Applause)
I do not think that is good enough.
How should we do this?
Thank you.
None!

Vaccination against bluetongue (debate)
Science has taken a step forward.
I think this is good practice.
It can result in the animals dying.
Many thanks!
The report will have our support.
What direction do we intend to take?
He has worked extremely hard on this.
You gave us this disease.
Please do not make matters worse.
I would encourage this.
Today's vaccines are more advanced.
We need to take account of this fact.
Many thanks to the rapporteur.
Naturally, that is not the end of it.
Is it really so difficult?
It will also be a very useful document.

Explanations of vote
Oral explanations of vote
This should be a priority for us now.
I certainly disagree with that.
That is my question.
Do we really want that?
We have to build systems that are safe.
We are not fomenting revolution.
You were quite right.
Let us work together to that end.
That is why I voted against this.
Therefore, I support the resolution.
Written explanations of vote
in writing. - I voted for this report.
This is noted in the report.
in writing. - I voted in favour.
That is a real pity.
So what is left?
Stop the hypocrisy.
This amendment was not adopted.
I voted in favour of this resolution.
I agree with carrying out stress tests.
To phase out nuclear power takes time.
Yet the strong signals were there!
in writing. - I voted against.
No one has yet told us.
Hence, my 'no' vote in the final vote.
I voted in favour of this resolution.
That is unacceptable.
in writing. - In favour.
It was certainly an overrated concept.
Now it could become underrated.
Point duly noted.
I therefore abstained on this text.
I agreed with this resolution.
in writing. - In favour.
It now remains to implement it.
I voted in favour of this resolution.


The project therefore has my support.
in writing. - In favour.
I believe it is a very balanced motion.
I agreed with this report.
in writing. - In favour.
in writing. - In favour.
Nothing has changed.
I voted against.

The case of Ai Weiwei in China
Nothing shall change.
That is the reality.
(Interruption by the President)
The sessions are extremely attractive.
This is plainly a smokescreen.
However, the EU can make a difference.
Resolute action is needed.
Ai Weiwei must be released now.
The regime is right to be afraid.
There was a great reformer, Zhou Enlai.
A Uachtar√°in, China is an enigma.
It is an attack on human rights.
It is something that we must change.

[Wednesday]:
Thank you.
We have to be sensible, though.
It really does not make sense.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is not a point of order.
Why is this very important to us?
I will check it.
The next item is the debate on:
This is not just about economic profit.
What a regrettable situation!
Why?
I call on you to vote for such action.
Of course, we work in Brussels.
We politicians need to step in here.
We must do what we can to help.
We have not used those possibilities.
Let us subsidise each other!
This is all nonsense.
This is a question of political logic.
So we have a vicious circle.
The era of cheap crude oil has gone.
This is a fact.

Why is this important?
Yet we must do the exact opposite.
Are you sure about that?
Let us look at this problem.
What is this ceiling?
Regarding the funds, let me explain.
We have to understand this.
The debate is closed.
Radio spectrum policy (debate)
For me, the choice is simple.
Here we have the proposal.
Just a couple of remarks to conclude.
Time is running out.
Everyone seems to agree on this point.
Good luck with it!
This performance level must be defined.
At home, one gigabyte costs me EUR 1.
The debate is closed.
I think that would be very problematic.
Why?
We, I am proud to say, reacted fast.
One thing was absolutely clear.
We needed to think outside the box.
I agree.
There should not be a link.
That is the right approach.
I ask them to reconsider.
The credibility of the EU is at stake.
I did so at the time and I do now.
I doubt it.
Why specifically on textiles?
Let us ask why we needed this package.
Has this changed?
First, we are not discussing an FTA.
I do not think I have to name them.
We tried to find a solution.
It is partially, yes.
Allow me just two final observations.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The issue is simple.
However, we must remain realistic.
Firstly: access to medicines.
Secondly: industrial sectors.
Thirdly: agriculture.
We must not forget this.
Examples have already been mentioned.
How come?
It is in our interest.
The world order is changing.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is also extremely important.
Is this still the plan?
That is the best way we can help.
I really want to be very clear on that.
OK, but we do not have much time.
The debate is closed.

EU-Japan trade relations (debate)

What effect will this have?
We do!
That is how we see it.

Written statements (Rule 149)
- C7-0172/2010 -.
How should we handle this situation?
It is not proving to be very easy.
I might as well be honest about that.
We must defend this part of the Treaty.
This is a far-reaching debate.
The Commission is now responsible.
We must increase transparency.
I also agree with Mr De Gucht.
This is not a simple issue.
It is all very, very depressing.
It has been difficult.
That would be unfortunate.

Now we need to learn lessons from this.
It is not yet too late to make changes.

2009 discharge (debate)
Firstly, I would like to thank you.
It has listed these items openly.
The first is security.
This really cannot continue.
This incurs far more expenditure.
Let me be clear and unequivocal.
I would like to make five comments.
That is actually not acceptable.
We need to remedy a few things.
There is a lot we can learn from that.
The EDF should also contribute to that.
It should please stop doing so.
The errors are not increasing.
This shows that it is possible.
We need clear rules.
Now we are making progress.
This is not fair.
Nonetheless, thank you for being here.
First of all, the Commission.
I also have to thank the Commission.
This is my 12th discharge exercise.
We have problems there.
No, we are not being overly critical.
It should be commended for this.
We would like to see it.
This is because it does not exist.
It made shocking reading.
Corrigenda (Rule 216): see Minutes
2009 discharge (continuation of debate)
That is what the Council signed up to.
We have too much money.
Good luck with this, Madam President.
I have a few comments.
They are no longer justified today.
I totally agree with him on that.
That situation has to change.
The error rate has reduced noticeably.
We very much appreciate that.

I voted for this discharge.
I voted in favour of this report.
I voted 'in favour'.
I therefore voted against the report.
Those the reasons why we voted against.
That is why we voted against.
I shall vote against.
For this there is still no solution.
It is no different with Georgia.
Thank you for this comment.

This is not a knee-jerk reaction.
This is not improvisation.
Immigration is a European challenge.
They should be an absolute last resort.
This has always been the case.
This is not what we are going to do.
Our proposals are on the table.
(Applause)
You gave the figures, Mr Weber.
(Applause)
You want to shove them onto us?
In that case, we will close the border.
What does the Commission then do?
(Applause)
We are losing the European spirit.
How can that be possible?
(The President interrupted the speaker)
In my opinion, it was not very clear.
The debate is long overdue.
What lack of security?
It has not gone under as yet.
They come in the usual way.
So stop making such a fuss.
Let me tell you something.
This was in 1939-1940.
It was Europe that was like this.
The United States turned them away.
The ship was called the Saint Louis.
(Applause)
Mr Schulz, did anyone stop you?
No.
Mr Verhofstadt, did anyone stop you?
No.
They did not stop me either.
We will create an √† la carte Europe.
(Applause)
That cannot be what my job is about.
It cannot be.
EUR 343 million.
EUR 100 million.
You attack them today as xenophobes.
Is that not a dreadful thing?
The power of the ballot box.
Well, here it is, Mr Barroso.
Here it is.
We urgently need more measures.
We need to put a stop to that.
It is not right.
I have only one request.
What nonsense!
Is it not time that it opened its eyes?
I for one think it is.
(Applause)
Europe is the master.
Member States want those powers back.
However, I am concerned, Commissioner.
So we are very clear in our messages.
Unblock it.
Work with us.
Yet that notion has taken hold.
We hear a lot said about solidarity.
That is what we should fight for.
That is our real task.
Which of these is it?
Those are the real issues!
Go on then, I dare you!
(Applause)
There is none of that here.
Is it possible to talk about that?
We cannot say ambiguous things.
Schengen is a huge achievement.
This must remain our primary goal.
However, caution is advised.
Temporary controls are not enough.
What is the reason for this?
This is scandalous.
Let us not go back on our principles.
Everything is there.
It is not possible.
It has been planned for a long time.
No, of course not.
Is there a reason for European action?
Yes, there is.
However, the system is not perfect.
Member States can also help each other.
That is what we are talking about.
We live in turbulent times.
We need to be calm in this situation.
We need more Europe, not less.
(Applause)
I deeply agree with that.

Thank you.
You could not say it more succinctly.
We must decide together.
However, further steps must be taken.
It should be anything but rigid.
Thank you.
This is not true.
That is the first clarification.
The register is already mandatory.
That is not possible.

Nuclear safety is not a local issue.
It is, in fact, a global issue.
Thank you for your attention.

Subject: Humanitarian aid for Libya
Are we getting our act together?
Can you reassure us?
Why?
And why do we do that?
Is that what it is?
Yes, indeed!
(GA) I want to thank the Commissioner.
You use the word 'compensation'.
Do you have this impression as well?
It makes other kinds of threats worse.
It is not an 'either/or' situation.
Last week, I came back from Korea.
They will start it on 1 January 2015.
That concludes Question Time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you Commissioner.
This is a question of political will.

However, he was wrong.
Thank you.
The consequences are unknown.
For this reason I have three questions.
How can you justify this distinction?

I spoke to him not long ago.
Of course I want to talk about Libya.
(Applause)
(Applause)
That is a challenge.
I have been there twice.
What is Europe's role in all of this?
Yes, we certainly are.
The answer is a resounding 'No'.
Baroness Ashton, we need to do more.
I would like to think so.
(Applause)
We now need to move on and take action.
What, then, are Europe's priorities?
Combating terrorism?
Trade policy?
Who are our preferential partners?
How can we achieve the best results?
'Do not be afraid,' Baroness Ashton.

(Applause)
I shall give a short comparison.
USD 162 billion in actual money.
One billion.
Not 162 billion, but one billion.
I think that is nothing at all.
My second message is about Syria.
Let us be honest, Baroness Ashton.
Syria is a huge disaster.
An Arab Tiananmen.
800 people killed to date.
8 000 people arrested to date.
(Applause)
So what can be done?
I say this is an unbalanced approach.
(Applause)
They are waiting for that.
Do it right now.
That is what we expect today from you.
Not tomorrow.
Today.
(Applause)
We wish it well.
We hope it will work.
Please tell us.
That cannot be the solution.
(Applause)
A vessel was in the area.
Apparently it was a Maltese vessel.
The EU must respond to this demand.
I agree.
Well, we support people right now.
We are on that journey.
I am really ambitious for this.
I understand that too.
I agree.
I like the three 'C's.
I do not think we are short-changed.
Absolutely.
These opportunities need to be seized!
As I have said, it is unsatisfactory.
One more thing.
Are we to repeat the mistakes of 2007?
That would be unthinkable for us.
Baroness Ashton, the matter is urgent.
Let us take the example of Libya.
What can you do?
Should Assad be included or not?
What is your opinion?
We would like to hear that.
Open the debate.
You are the rotating Presidency.
You can take initiatives.
You should set the agenda.
I do not understand why.
Follow Margaret Mead, whom you cited.
Be the agent of change that we need.
What is happening now in Tunisia?
All this will not happen automatically.
How good can we be in our home field?
We must definitely make that clear.
(Applause)
That is extremely important.
I believe that this is important.
Is it Mr Westerwelle or who?
I think that will get support for you.
Explore your mandate.
Go ahead and tell us.
It was a statement that was made.
You have an impossible task.
You can draw your own conclusions.
On the contrary, what we see is uproar.
Let us not forget them.
This was one of them.
Let me now turn to the Middle East.
What progress is being made in Ukraine?
It is not.
What is yours today?
There has been no substantial progress.
We need to turn over a new leaf.
We have been taken by surprise.
That is the word she used.
Where is our meteorological road map?
Our sin is inaction.
It is the wrong approach.
Our debate has two weaknesses.

These challenges are very real.
Do more, therefore.
What is the benefit?
What is your opinion on this?

There would be no effect at all.

Explanations of vote
Oral explanations of vote
It is one of the rights of consumers.
In practice, this is about trust.
This has to be defined.
When is it classed as a meeting?
Surely not?
It is also in our own interests.
I find it incomprehensible.
Free trade is good!
Free trade is good!
Free trade is good!
In a way, I think this is fantastic.
Well, enough of dogmatics.
We obviously do not support this.
Thank you.
What hypocrisy!
I think that three things are needed.

Unfortunately, this was not to be.
Welcome
(Applause)
This was a very special event.
The entire team was pulling together.
Now we need to take the next step.
We must fill this gap.
In legal terms, this was all untrue.
Not being able to label is an excuse.
It is technically incorrect.
What needs to happen now?
Certainly, we have lost some time.
The document clearly stated that
The Council did not want it.
That is the Council's position.
I agree with Ms Liotard.
Many thanks for that.
I will now get back to the substance.
Traceability is essential.
I would like to make one point.
What was the end result?
We hoped for your support, Mr Dalli.
There is a need for action.
That was our position.
Precisely what was that?
It helped in establishing our position.
This is substantial, 360 degree unity.
The debate is closed.
Small Business Act review (debate)
The next item is the debate on
Once should be enough.
I would like to mention a few of these.
Implementation is very important.
This leads me to my last point.
What growth?
A few figures.
Thank you for your attention.
However, this is not enough.
Rule 149(8))
What are these?
We have made significant progress.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
First, Ireland.
Second, Greece.
This is also a positive development.
Finally, Portugal.
I disagree with this view.
Thank you.
What are you doing to speed things up?
How is this being achieved?
(The President cut off the speaker)
They have defaulted.
They are broke.
For God's sake, let us all admit it.
Absolutely right.
Europe is at a crossroads.

Portugal has a 900-year history.
Portugal is capable.
The euro is a strong currency.
In fact, Eurobonds already exist.
So his solution will not work.
It is a question of solidarity.
(The speaker speaks in English)
I am astonished.
Of course we are not.
(The speaker speaks in English)

There is no way to avoid default.
Do it!
Do not throw good money after bad.
I think that everyone realises that.
Unless you refuse to see it?
How can that be?
This is the swindle of the century!
What has been the outcome of that?
The outcome was crisis in Greece!
What is at issue is a loan, not a gift.
(The President cut off the speaker)
I have a question for Mr Toussas.
Is that what you want?
I think that is very positive.
Mr Rangel, I have a question for you.
I do not say that with any delight.
It is a real and serious problem.
For God's sake, let the centre unite.
It is a question of no pain, no gain.
That is why I want to reply to you now.
The case of Sweden has been mentioned.
It sounds very easy and neat.
Banks would also bear the cost.
What would happen?
A massive credit crunch.
It would melt down.
Would that help Greece or Europe?
I doubt it.
That is the goal of this exercise.
We have examples of this.
You know this very well.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
One thing is clear to all of us.
If so, may we see the criteria?
May we see them?
We ask: is this duplication worthwhile?
What response can it give us?
A good question.
Is Greece suffering?
We are already over time.
That is a lot of money.
The debate is closed.
How can we be?
What do we want to achieve?
Cut the red tape.
Thank you.
Europe urgently needs innovation now.
Why?
Think about this.
We need to put an end to that.
I have three points to make.
I will never forget that evening.
They only asked for one thing.
It is a very fine result.
Where are we, essentially?
A re-balancing is needed.
How will you now conduct the dialogue?
We want to see more of you.
In fact, I have a lot of faith in that.
That is the challenge facing us.
One was the need to avoid duplication.
Most of the speakers talked about jobs.
It was a very inclusive process.
So where do we go from here?
Let us not end with this one report.
We cannot let it end here.
So let us be innovators here today.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The return is guaranteed.
We believe this is best practice.
The European Union must set an example.
This is simply not acceptable.
I would like to comment on four points.
This is a good thing.
We should therefore professionalise it.
The ratio is 1:2.
The debate is closed.
Antibiotic resistance (debate)
Why do we need these data?
As I said, I am extremely pleased.
Thank you.
So I support the intent of the debate.
We must not forget this.
We are in complete agreement on this.
They reach people via meat.
They will then be fleshed out in 2012.
We need that information.
Let us get the information.
Do you know how it came into being?
Others may not.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Regulations alone are not enough.
Agenda of the next sitting: see Minutes
Closure of the sitting
Opening of the sitting
Statement by the President
Documents received: see Minutes
The next item is the joint debate on:
It enriches peoples' lives.
We need better-qualified people.
(Applause)
The figures speak for themselves.
These measures have several strands.
Creators' mobility must be encouraged.
Mr President, let us get back on topic.
It is a core interface.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
These are the successes.
Mobility does cause certain problems.
Data roaming is extremely expensive.
What did we propose?
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is something we must take note of.
I have one last point to make.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Sarajevo deserves a European spring.
Let us take that as the benchmark.
I support the motion for a resolution.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
The second issue is that of funding.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
We do not dictate to Member States.
They now need practical implementation.
Will Europe do something about it?
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at noon.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Culture is a significant asset.
Education plays a vital role here.
Of course, money is not everything.
Statement by the President
At least seven people were killed.
Many were injured.
The Lorca tragedy is becoming clear.

I will ask everyone to rise.
We will now observe a minute's silence.

We can see that it has failed.
This is unique in the world.
It is our bad luck and their good luck.
Now that is changing.
There is a case for and against CCCTB.
(Applause)
The case for it has not been proven.
It is time that we said: No more!
Hence, I support the report.
Thank you.
This is a kind of modern day slavery.
Ideology cannot replace science.
This is why I endorsed the report.
This is important to remember.
Written explanations of vote
I voted in favour of this report.
I voted for the Zver report.
Thank you.
in writing. - I voted for this report.
I voted in favour of this report.
I voted for Mrs Honeyball's report.
The same is true for education.
They have enormous creative potential.
The Honeyball report is one of them.
Did I read 'partners'?

That is deplorable.
I therefore voted against this report.

I voted in favour of this report.
I endorsed this resolution.
Culture can contribute to this.
1.
That is the very least.
It is on both sides, Mr Van Orden.
It is not only on the Tamil side.
There have been crimes on both sides.
Both sides are responsible.
Victory is not the same as peace.
Reconciliation is imperative.
Justice is vital for a new beginning.
Both sides need to be investigated.
The facts have to be established.
People have been to Sri Lanka.
It justifies nothing.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.
Written statements (Rule 149)

Azerbaijan (debate)
The truth is quite different.

Order of business
[Monday]:
You have the floor.
They are not political debates.
This is a slight change to the agenda.
(The order of business was adopted)
(Applause)
We must never forget.
It must never happen again.
(Applause)
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
This is taking far too long.
That is our goal.
That is very important.
That would be the wrong approach.
This is extremely important.
This, however, is just the beginning.
Let us be frank.
Is this really how you see it?
Why do we need these data?
I believe that is the second element.
Consider Fukushima.
Why is that?
The paralogisms of the past must stop.
There are good reasons for this.
Thank you very much.
Please continue with this good work.
I think that is important.
Please remember that as well.
That is why this is now necessary.
We are also tackling this in stages.
Thank you very much.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
The Commission supports this agreement.
Gradually and progressively.
One big step at a time.
That is something that we lack.
The work on this reform has begun.
That is how it works.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
We now have the Europe 2020 strategy.
Next, we have the major challenges.
That is extremely important.
Of its funding, 50% is yet to be spent.
That will create better results.
We cannot agree with this model.
Congratulations on your report.
This mid-term retrospection is crucial.
I think we can be proud of this fact.
Secondly, financing.
Thank you.
I have a second comment to make.
I have two more brief points to make.
There is less red tape.
That simply cannot work.
They will not run away with the money.
The second point is excellence.
The third point is mobility.
This situation cannot be repeated.
Thank you.
Thank you for what you are doing.
Excellence is the key word.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
EU-Canada trade relations (debate)
However, we have four red lines.
That is something that we all welcome.
That is worth emphasising.
We have to tell Canada to back off.
You even made reference to it yourself.
The ban has not been ineffective.
We want to retain public services.
Good partners work together.
They are a democracy.
They respect human rights.
It is worth trying.

This is the case once again.
Their environment is being destroyed.

Fundamental elements are missing.
Why is this?

I put forward five proposals.
Thirdly, we need more competition.
We have a de facto oligopoly.
Therefore, this needs consideration.
Obviously it is not.

We do not have any results to date.
We have to learn lessons on this front.
(Applause)
I would like to do the same.
Hundreds of people are severely ill.
Twenty-two people have already died.
That was unacceptable.
We need to work on this.
Is it about manure spreading?
I wish to make three points.
Death, unfortunately, is permanent.
We are discussing labelling today.
We cannot know everything.
The Commissioner is right.
We must learn from the lessons of this.
Our food must be safe.

Today, it is not bean sprouts.
Feedback will have to be given.
We clearly need more Europe.
Mr President, hearsay can be dangerous.
To date, we have 22 deaths in the EU.
ECDC is publishing daily updates.
Something is not right, Commissioner.
(Applause)
For me, that is not the point, either.
(Applause)
Mr President, this is a real crisis.
The situation is serious.
Why such an incredible time lapse?
No end is in sight.
She cannot ignore her responsibilities.
They were not contaminated!
An epidemic knows no frontiers.
We ask for compensation.


Everything else can be discussed later.
Who is in charge?
Now, something similar has happened.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
What has happened is a tragedy.
The Commission supports this agreement.
Are we going to oblige them to do so?
We did not succeed in doing this.
That is one of the positive elements.
I find that very little.
I would ask you to clarify this.
The UK has been politically taken over.
The EU is not news.
No, because they are not informed.
That is not sustainable.
What do we want tomorrow?
(Applause)
That is inexplicable.
It was a tough struggle, though.
(Applause)
What is in this text?
What does it say?
We shall vote for this principle.
This is a harmful concession.
We shall therefore vote for it.
We have unfair competition.
On the roads, the toll is voluntary.
It is capped.
On the railways, there is no limit.
(Applause)
For me, there are three.
These, then, are control mechanisms.
This directive must be resisted.
This must be made very clear.
In that sense, it is a bad name.
Secondly, please accept the compromise.
So it is going in the right direction.
Now we are taking a step forward.
We must first take this step forwards.

Announcement by the President
More needs to be done.
We did have the toolbox already.
It is not over.
That is the way forward.
That does not matter.
We are getting mixed messages here.
This is still ongoing work.
I would like to say three things.
One final question: tax evasion.
We all want an Internet that is open.
There was not really any negotiation.
The debt problems are not exclusive.
She cannot be at all of them.
I waited until the end as a result.
This is, therefore, real austerity.
I will stick to the topic.
I want to reassure you on that point.
How would you explain this?
That would be quite right.
I agree with you completely.
Do these social developments worry you?
They are a major political issue.
We will all support it.
That is the only way out of it.
Sudan and South Sudan (debate)
Thank you, Mr Piebalgs.
I must also mention Darfur.
There is positive news.
Lastly, I must mention justice.
There has to be an end to impunity.
It is most worrying.
I will just add a few points.
We must keep this firmly in mind.
They want to create laws.
What a statistic that is.
They do not have a civil service.
If not, how can we in Europe help?
I find that regrettable.
This is a crushing rebuke, in fact.
The crisis is far from over.
Infrastructure is largely non-existent.
Sudan was a failed state.
I will end on a positive note.
This is a truly grotesque undertaking.

It is not the same situation as before.
So that is a completely new situation.
But that issue has not been forgotten.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
This must remain a priority.
I trust Bulgaria and Romania.
These criteria essentially number five.
This notion is completely unacceptable.
I repeat: absolutely not.
The facts just do not back the idea up.
Of course we should not - never!
Take the blinkers off!
This is already done.
We cannot allow double standards.
What underlies these reasons?
They have good reasons for so doing.
It is giving none whatsoever.
Anything else is political hypocrisy.
(Applause)
They meet the Schengen standards.
This is the nub of it.
I recall counting 87.
(Applause)

It is justice which we are waiting for.
I pray to God that I am wrong.
This situation is unacceptable.
What is the current state of affairs?
Now, however, the debate has changed.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is the case.
Indeed, they were not wrong.
(The President cut off the speaker)
All this needs to be done.
How did we try to achieve this?
This is a time-consuming process.
We had six months to achieve this.
What can help create mutual trust?
Let us not confuse the two.
We are in the final hour.
I totally disagree.
The debate is closed.
Many have a paramilitary background.
It is about EU cohesion.
Question Time (Commission)
Part one
Subject: Quality food schemes
The objection period lasts six months.
We are talking of quality food!
Mr President, I will be very brief.
Subject: Youth unemployment
And in Spain, it is more than 40%.
Let me give you a few examples.
We cannot afford this brain drain.
What is going to happen about this?

So let me first answer Mr Papanikolaou.
This is a sign of concrete solidarity.
(EL) Commissioner, thank you very much.
You spoke about trust.
Yes, we want to keep building up trust.
Part two
Subject: Visa scheme for Kosovo
Cybercrime is becoming a volume crime.
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
Of course we need to do more.
We are the guardians of EU law.
That is a problem.
It could have its own budget.
I look forward to hearing your views.
The EGF is among them.
Subject: Collective labour agreements
I do not believe that is true.
Is it you?
Is it the International Monetary Fund?
A clear reply, if you please.
This is an ongoing discussion.
Yes, we really are serious about 2020.
You need power lines to do this.
Are we seeing results?
That concludes Question Time.
Agenda of the next sitting: see Minutes
Closure of the sitting
Opening of the sitting
I think not.
That is what will make us strong.
This is a good draft plan.
Of course we want to help farmers.
We have to help farmers.
Of course we want to help North Africa.
We have to help North Africa.
We must change nothing at all.
There are other ways to make savings.
Let me give you three examples.
First of all, foreign policy.
In the US, there are 28 000 diplomats.
There is a saving to be made there.
Another example is monetary policy.
(Applause)
Europeans need to be told the truth.
This budget needs to change direction.
That will help create jobs and growth.
To Mr Verhofstadt, I have to say this.
We need a budget which is more focused.
That is dealing with money efficiently.
Look also at infrastructure.
There, too, you need European money.
Or take innovation and research.
Now, that is clever investing.
We must therefore invest in that.
What are the new challenges?
For that, too, we need European money.
The current system is bankrupt.
Consider a financial transaction tax.
This is a clever policy.
This simply does not add up.
How ridiculous!
Why?
There is a blue card.
Mr Hartong, are you ready to answer?
That will continue to be the case.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Eastern Germany requires support.
Cohesion is linked with solidarity.
I would ask for your broad support.
You have both done an excellent job.
Why is that?
This report lacks ambition.
Be careful.
Thank you very much indeed.
(Applause)
We were very pleased with this.
It is realistic and achievable.
We genuinely need more Europe.
Please read the report.
Thank you for your excellent work.
This is therefore a solid achievement.
Is the result sufficiently ambitious?
I believe it is.
We have a grip on the EU budget.
Welcome
(Applause)
On the contrary.
We have two options.
This is an outrage!
This is not demagogy but simple ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Do we want to play a role at all?
We deal in plain speaking.
What is it that we want?
We do not want to freeze the budget.
That is our strategy.
Solidarity has specific aspects.
However, I will give you one example.
We should have set priorities.
We also need partners.
(The President cut off the speaker)
How can that be achieved?
This is unacceptable.
The Polledo report has been a failure.
We need more and better Europe.
We need to increase the budget.
Otherwise, the report is acceptable.
That is my first point.
You are well aware of this.
(The President cut off the speaker)
By 2050, that figure will be 5% or 6%.
Yet apparently, even that is too much.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
We need more and better Europe.
I believe that ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Perhaps that is what they mean.
That is simply unacceptable.
Who will pay?
(The President cut off the speaker)

The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Europe shall not be among the losers.
One must genuinely create Europe'.
Regulation needs to be pruned.
On the contrary, it should be cut.
This money can be put to better use.
This is not an abstract statement.
Europe is experiencing a crisis.

The Romania/Bulgaria acquis?
Thank you.
This is why I voted for this report.
They are quite at a loss.
This is also reflected in the figures.
That is actually already in the Treaty.
I completely reject that approach.
This is simply untrue.
I voted for the adoption of the report.
Thank you.
Written explanations of vote
I support the rapporteur's position.
I voted in favour of the report.
It has brought nothing but trouble.
This report asks for even more.
This demand is unacceptable.

It cannot.
I therefore support the report.

To stand still is to move backwards.
Therefore, I voted in favour.

This also poses problems for Europe.
We should do the same.
I voted in favour of this resolution.
I hope that will be the case.
It has been negotiating since 2004.
This is unacceptable.
in writing. - In favour.
However, the report is spineless.
This is a key issue.
It is now madder than ever.
in writing. - I voted for this report.
I consider it to be very timely.
I voted in favour.
I am voting against for these reasons.
in writing. - In favour.
The final text includes my amendments.
It is more than that.
Never.
Europe has a duty to be a model.
We should support CSR, not regulate it.

I voted in favour.

I am opposed to this.
That is why I voted for the report.
I therefore voted for this report.

That is why I voted against the report.

This should not be forgotten.
I voted in favour.
I have therefore abstained from voting.
This is a key point for Greece.

I am voting for this report.
This is partially understandable.

I welcome Mr Mitchell's report.
We can do more and better.

What is the scope of the assessment?

The budget must match our ambitions.
That is why we voted against it.
We therefore voted against.
How is it to be financed?
By a new European tax, of course!
Who are they trying to kid?
Europe already costs a great deal.
What has been the result?
This is a line that we cannot support.
I voted in favour.
Should there be a budget for that?
I think not.
I voted in favour.
I therefore voted against this motion.
in writing. - In favour.
We must not miss such an opportunity.
We must not allow this to happen.

Revised Hungarian constitution (debate)
I have questions for you.
This reveals your real partisan bias.
I cannot overlook this.
Are these only political values?
Is this a purely Hungarian affair?
I would not say so.
That is true.
That cannot be the case.
None.
This is wrong.
How can you expect us to accept it?
Not just repealed, but invalid.
Now we are.
Others have mentioned others.
I challenge you to name them.
What is part of our fundamental rights?
Yes, or no?
Hungary had a Green ...
(Laughter)
OK, laugh if you want to.
My country does not have such a post.
Why did you abolish it then?
These values should be preserved.
I have been listening to the debate.
We agree.
This criticism is shameful.
It could be changed so far.
Please be specific.
What is the problem here?
Maybe not European, only Hungarian?
That is not the issue at stake.
I cannot see a contradiction here.
This is what I wanted to say.
What was the reason for this?
This is not true.
It undermines borders between states.
It is here that the problem lies.
I would like to say one more thing.
This is my first question.
This is my answer.
We expect better of our EU Presidency.
Why are we having this debate then?
Who did you pass them on to?
Thank you for your attention.
Please, do your job!
Now it is the turn of the constitution.
The world is finally back to rights.
I hope he would like to reply.
It is located in Strasbourg.
That is the crucial point.
This is irresponsible behaviour.

The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
European Arrest Warrant (debate)
I think not.
I think we need to reconsider that.
Why is this happening?
There are simply no real safeguards.
Will they please do so now?
(ES) No, Mr Dartmouth.
One is the lack of proportionality.
The most notable case is Andrew Symeou.
You talk about the appeal procedure.
His name is Mr Cor Disselkoen.
However, often they are disregarded.
This is piffle!
Liberal Democrat.

EU-Russia summit (debate)
Our interaction is quite intense.
What are our priorities?
The elections will be the acid test.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We must absolutely reject that.
That is something we reject.
However, Russia is ready for democracy.
That is our desire and our vision.
We cannot accept this.
(Applause)
Two summits a year is too much.
This is nothing short of blackmail.
Just one more brief question.
Georgia has de facto the right of veto.
It very much looks like it.
I would ask you to raise this issue.
We cannot afford to compromise here.
This is a major campaign.
I have one request.
We cannot agree to this.
Let me comment on some of these areas.
First: elections.

For that, of course, you need ski runs.
I have just one supplementary question.
These are two small communities.
Substantial payments have been made.
That must also be stated.
This is where the big problem lies.
What does Mr Potoƒçnik have in mind?
The debate is closed.
She also felt very foolish.
There is an ambiguity here.
They never hear another thing.
They have found two cracks here.
You need to act and to act quickly.
This is not good enough.
It is as simple as that.
We will start work on this immediately.
The debate is closed.

(Heckling from Mr Turmes)
In any case, we had a tough struggle.
(Heckling from Mrs Harms)
Please trust me to remain objective.
I said 'in the middle', Mrs Harms.
Please listen carefully.
(Heckling from Mr Turmes)
(Applause and heckling)
There are two reasons for this.
The first is purely formal.
(Heckling)
(Applause)
That is a fact.
(Applause)
We can do this.
We had this problem before Fukushima.
Why is this?
This is unfortunately not the case.
That is a problem.
I have two questions.
Why did you not say thank you?
I am happy to admit that openly.
It is not a secret.
(The President cut off the speaker)
How committed are you?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Let us therefore go on with the debate
That is not true.
This is a global issue.
Both projects have similar problems.
We need comprehensive stress tests.
We need to amend the directive.
What I am interested in are results.
I have two questions.
I have two more questions.
The Euratom Treaty must be revised.
Thank you and good luck.
They were badly needed.
At present, we have no such regulator.
Are you going to start that debate?
We are in agreement on these tests.
Congratulations, you have got them.
So, let us take some responsibility.
This is understandable.
This should be our priority today.

Are there any comments?
(The amendment was rejected)
The request is rejected.
The order of business is thus adopted.
And they are right in doing so.
Let me start with economic policy.
Let me now say some words on Croatia.
Agreement on this package is vital.
The proposal will have three aims.
(Applause)
We must not let them down.
So let us act upon it.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We are in a severe crisis.
We all have the crisis that we deserve.
(Applause)
Why do we need more Europe?
Who is behind them?
(Applause)
Solidarity means sharing.
That is not right.
(Applause)
They are on the table.
(Applause)
Welcome
If so, we need a positive plan for it.
We need to be very clear on that.
(Applause)
That is what we need.
Mr President, let us be very honest.
You can play a major role in this.
I am counting on you.
What does Greece have a duty to do?
That is the truth.
Why?
And why?
So let us act accordingly.
This is not a crisis of Europe.
(Applause)
We are still in favour of it.
That is also your responsibility.
Thank you for your attention.
Things will just carry on as before.
That is where the problem lies.
We must continue down this route.
What a fine mess you have got us into.
We did not join the euro, thank God.
'Europe will deliver', he said.
It is time we put a stop to that.
No European citizen voted for this man.
Granting aid to Greece is useless.
We have made an impact assessment.
(Applause).
Does he also see it in this way?
I wanted to make that absolutely clear.
That is extremely important.
That is the next big test.
Democracy has to endorse this.
We must prevent future crises.
(The President cut off the speaker)
What can we promise?
Allow me to make three proposals: .....
(The President cut off the speaker)
Democracy?
Libya is a war zone.
Rules are man-made and can be unmade.
We have reached a historic moment.
Italy has received them.
Italy.
Lastly there is the Croatia chapter.
What exactly is available to us?
The European Union is.
The first concerns Greece.
That is how Europe is going.
Let us look at the case of Greece.
Let us talk about Greece, then.
Greece is not just any country.
That is not the right path.
I believe that is what is at stake.
Nobody is blameless in this respect.
All for one and one for all.
But this is not helping us.
I am pleased that this is the case.
A concluding remark on Croatia.
Let me start with economic issues.
Firstly, because this package is good.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 149)
Thank you once again for this report.
I am happy to answer any questions.
Mr President, my apologies!
Please start timing.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Let us not lose sight of that fact.
We cannot accept a budget cut.
So there is no need to cap them.
I listened to the talk about greening.
Mr Le Foll is right.
This, too, is in the report.
(The speaker concluded off-microphone)
We are looking into the matter.
Apparently it was a channel mix-up.
We are working on the problem.
That is not what we think, of course.
Let us demand equality.
Yes, I agree with you.
The first phase is complete.
I think that is important.
This is not a question of ideology.
Why?
In the future we must improve it.
The world is short of food.
I very much welcome this development.
I cannot support such developments.
Environmental programmes are expensive.
We need a strong first pillar.
What do we think of the Dess report?
Parts of it are good.
This is what consumers expect.
The CAP must respond to this challenge.
I wanted to make that point.
There are major imbalances there, too.
We are able to offer you that.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Briefly on the other directives.
We have therefore firmed up the rules.
We have introduced penalties for fraud.
Symmetry is an important issue.
Now it is time to rectify this.
This package is important.
We worked hard together.
We really appreciate what he has done.
That is something that Europe needs.
Why is that?
This is necessary.
This is also extremely important.
I will come back to that as well.
I could go on and on.
I am worried.
That will not work.
Let me conclude with a simple message.
We think that this is very wrong.
What message for them?
Some prefer intergovernmentalism.
This is a fundamental reservation.
This is reserved for the Commission.
Thank you for your attention.
Unfortunately, that is not the case.
Exactly the opposite is true.
That is what the voters expect of us.
We owe this to our electorate.
Everyone will be affected.
The nervousness has spread.
Their message changed from day to day.
That is true.
That is not good company to keep.
We cannot support that.
We have negotiated with all the groups.
Responsibility means walking.
Reality has now caught up with us.
The EU is now trying a new approach.
I think we do.
Thus, managing sanctions is necessary.
What do we need, then?

We are therefore against them.

It was the Greek communists.
That is where we must start.
That is the wrong way to go.

(FR) Mr President, I have two points.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We risk confusing cause and effect.
This is the heterogenesis of purpose.

That has not been the case.
I welcome the issue of Eurobonds.
(The President cut off Mrs Lulling)
What are the causes of the crisis?
We stand by these results.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, compromise is wise.
The problem will not go away.
And how do we intend to get out of it?
You are on the wrong track.
We tend to forget that.
What we .....
(The President cut off the speaker)
Unfortunately, this is not the case.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Prevention is easier than cure.
That is why it deserves your support.
Never again.
That is very clear.
We want a growing European economy.
We want stability.
We certainly want transparency.
I want to make a simple point.
We need to be united.
I am appealing for unity, therefore.
They are ready to do it in public.
Thank you.
We now have a package before us.
We have achieved a great deal.
- The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
This is all very well.
That is a mistake, however.
We are at a turning point.
We are thus approaching a crossroads.
My last point concerns exports.
This is also a concern in this case.
I find this irresponsible.
Unfortunately, she was right.
However, that is not enough.
In principle, you are right.
However, we are all citizens of Europe.
This is not seriously going to happen.
You are calling for transparency.
Nobody is against transparency.
I approve.
To my mind, it is not.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
That is an unacceptable risk.
One-minute speeches (Rule 150)
Œ§he next item is one-minute speeches.
Thank you for your attention.
Let the people decide.
I have three other points to mention:
I demand explanations.
That concludes the debate on this item.
That is a good thing.
That is very important.
That is crucial.
So what is in the report?
Let me be very clear.
Who could be opposed to this?
That makes a total of 30%.
I will therefore vote against.
What do I mean by that?
One thing is clear.
We will be happy to meet your demands.
The debate is closed.

2012 draft budget trilogue (debate)
This is the first part of the answer.
It is not enough to draft a budget.
The result is as it was presented.
Who is responsible for this?
It is often the Member States.
The United Kingdom.
Why is that?
We should take a brave step forward.
She sets a very good example.
That is, of course, absolutely right.

The sooner the better.

Failed projects should be discontinued.
These are alarming figures.
We must do much more for young people.
We must support it.
I think that has to be our target.
The budget is therefore a focal tool.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 149)
Thank you very much for your attention.
Partnership is often an empty concept.
What is territorial cooperation?
What purpose does it serve?
What are the issues at stake?
What future do we want to give it?
That is why it is important.
I am looking forward to the discussion.
Finally, I would make this point.
We as politicians ought to do the same.

It is not business as usual.
It is cynical propaganda.
We know this to be a fact.
The policy objectives are well known.
That is excellent in itself.
We have done that already.
We shall do so.
That is a very important point.
It demands priorities for the future.
We need to send out a clear message.

That is a priority.
Therefore, EU support is necessary.

This would be a suicidal step.
There are three key ideas.
I wish to make two requests.
That is not so.
Welcome
The joint debate is closed.

We need more Europe.

This vote will help in that regard.
That is why I abstained.
I voted against this document.
That is why I abstained.
A reformed CAP must account for this.
This is good news.
The report therefore has my backing.
in writing. - (FR) In favour.
The risk of a wide gap is quite real.
I therefore support food sovereignty.

Closure of the sitting
Resumption of the session
We must do all we can to fulfil it.
It is other things that are lethal!
We must fulfil this obligation.
And we bear the responsibility for it.
And now to work!
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
(The sitting was closed at 6.20 p.m.)
Election of the President
I declare the first ballot open.
Please come to the rostrum.
We believe you will do so.
Mr President, we wish you well.
Good luck, Mr President.
(Applause)
So I shall be free and independent'.
I believe this message must be heeded.
Let me give you one simple example.
Please continue, Mrs Green.
That is what has prevailed here today.
(Applause )
Election of the Vice-Presidents
Thank you very much, Mr Falconer.
Is there any objection?
It is not good enough!
It appears not.
Mr Miller, thank you for your words.
In other words, everyone...
I cannot recall it.
That is correct.
That is what we decided.
(Applause, mixed reactions)
I never claimed to have the last word.
That is not correct.
The vote was taken by secret ballot.
Election of Quaestors
(The vote took place)
Address by the President
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mr Colom i Naval.
That will be corrected.
In fact, I was elected .
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
Thank you, Mr Falconer.
That will be noted.
That has been noted, Mr Herman.
Very well, Mrs Green.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Nothing else will satisfy us.
It was a very controversial amendment.
The Rules only mention the President.
I want to make two important points.
Thank you, Mr McGowan.
The President may exclude a Member.
This is clearly a delicate matter.
Thank you, Mr Martens.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Mrs Muscardini, this matter is closed.
Election of Quaestors (continuation)
The results are as follows:
Two seats remain to be filled.
The next item is the joint debate on:
Such a role is crucial at this moment.
We thank the presidency for that.
We disagree with that.
A new strategy for an old objective!
That is something you cannot change!
This is totally misleading.
They will have to be fleshed out.
Many speakers have alluded to this.
So that is a real step backwards.
A final word, Mr President.
Singapore was a successful conference.
The same logic must apply to Taiwan.
They should be.
Fortunately, we also had Singapore.
Let us not lag behind, Mr Santer.
That is Dublin's great contribution.
That must be our objective during 1997.
Her figures are out of date.
No.
But no action is being taken.

The flame has been kept alive.
That is not sufficient.
They are to be welcomed.
Progress must be made here.
This treaty has to be ratified.
(Loud and sustained applause)
The debate is closed.
Election of Quaestors (continuation)
The results are as follows:
Amendment No 1 has been withdrawn.
Thank you, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy.
I shall consider your request.
(Parliament adopted the decision)
It is an opportunity not to be missed.
Where should our priority lie?

But Europe is not quite ready for them.
Why should this be so?
But it does not stop there.
We must not think of it in isolation.


(Applause)
I shall be quite brief.

So it has its reputation to maintain.
Is it masochism or a fear of failure?
On what will we judge the results?
Then there is foreign policy.
You are aware of this too.
I cannot find any mention of one.
Next, there is the democratic deficit.
We are standing at a crossroads.
And that is what I am asking for now.
What sort of growth?
He was being much too candid.
Nobody wants Turkey to be isolated.
It is everyone's responsibility.
That is very good.
I am very hopeful that they can.
Yet what does the record show?
Well, she certainly made that clear.
EMU is not the enemy of employment.
There are no hidden agendas.
This is what we have always said.
Our job is to achieve consensus.
Let me just say one thing here.
It is extremely difficult.
Let me tell you this.
That is why we are not sitting back.
We need to be very cautious here.
I shall be very brief, Minister.
Today, we are piling ridicule on shame.
Thank you, Mr van Mierlo.
The debate is closed.
Distance selling
These are being used more and more.
I think this is something entirely new.
I think in Dutch it is verloren hoop .
The debate is closed.
Novel foods and food ingredients
It is not true!
What will there be then?
It is either something or nothing.
This is tantamount to force-feeding.
There are absolutely none!
I personally would not do that.

And why?
That is my first point.
There are three key words.
The first is safety.
The second is information.
That information is now being provided.
But this is far from the truth.
That is as it should be.
Well, that is not the case.
But I have some misgivings.
Mankind does not accept closed doors.
All progress involves risks.
You are lying in that respect!
Then no one would take it seriously.
Today, however, I have to do so.
The opposite is the truth!
The relevant criteria do not exist.
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
I can only confirm what Mr White said.
Thank you, Mr Bangemann.
The debate is closed.
Cross-border credit transfers
We appreciate its difficulties.
What were those differences?
Why?
Help is at hand Dorothy!
I think that the benefits are obvious.
The situation now is much more clear.
The debate is closed.
EU-Latin America partnership
That is partly thanks to Europe.
And we must now build on this success.
Security and defence.
Thus 450 million consumers.
Not in relation to energy, Mr Bertens.
It is not properly funded.
We have political dialogue instruments.
It affects them both.
That had long been lacking.
We wish the report much success.
There are many Latin Americas.
You are right about this.
The debate is closed.
San Jos√© dialogue
It must be extended and updated.
We welcome and support that process.
How was this achieved?
The debate is closed.
There is no reason for subsidiarity.
But there are no 'free lunches' .
What can we learn from this?
The debate is closed.
Air traffic management
But all these are only first steps.
This is done in some Member States.
I do not think that is necessary.
I see it as irresponsible.
That is our common aim.
There are three points I wish to raise.
Delays are an everyday occurrence.
How could it be otherwise?
What is the Commission's view?
The debate is closed.
Public transport and state aid
I hope I have more or less succeeded.
Public undertakings have to reform.
They have to do their own part too.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.15 a.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
I note your observation.
Mrs Pack, you are absolutely correct.
We will see that it is put right.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Mr Cox, I take note of your request.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
My group supports you in that view.
This brings me to my fourth point.
That is completely wrong.
I will mention just two.
I want to make some brief points.
Nothing has been solved!
We welcome that too.
This issue will not go away.
This is absolute nonsense.
It seems always to be bad news.
I think that would be unjust.
You then spoke of efficiency.
Here also, courage will be needed.
So thank you, Mrs Bonino.
Something is wrong with the equation.
The Commissioner never fudges things.
She always gets straight to the point.
I have received no explanation.
But quite clearly, we are frustrated.
There is not enough fish, my friends.
That is the crux of the matter.
We have to act in a consistent way.
Finally let us talk about Morocco.
I shall look first at Morocco.
Mr Teverson, I fully share your view.
Because that is not the main issue.
The consequences of this are obvious.
It was more of a political signal.
Thank you very much, Mrs Bonino.
The debate is closed.
Community forestry strategy
And why was that so?
The result is here for all to see.
We now proceed to the votes.
Statement by the President
(Applause)
Votes
Thank you very much, Mr H√§nsch.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, on a point of order.
(Mixed reactions)
There were two reasons for that.

Oomen-Ruijten report (A4-0009/97)
Roth-Behrendt report (A4-0006/97)

But consumers wish to know that.
This report is incomplete.
Monitored by whom?
With what information?
But BSE still frightens us!
Peijs report (A4-0004/97)
Kerr report (A4-0367/96)
We are naturally opposed to that.
We welcome that.
Bertens report (A4-0416/96)
Carnero Gonz√°lez report (A4-0418/96)
Let me now talk about certification.
There must be transparency of origin.
This fact is the premise of the report.
This hazard has been avoided.
Wood is a renewable energy source.
How is this to be interpreted?
I think this is terrible.
What are the problems with forests?
And one final thought, Mr President.
We need woods in general to survive.
I thank Mr Thomas for his report.
So, there is a great diversity.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Mrs Bonino.
The debate is closed.
Consultation of workers
But on one thing we must be clear.
We are very much in favour of it.
It is not easy.
That is I think a very important point.
That is one thing.
And it is our duty to do so.
That is going too far.
Let me now turn to a fundamental point.

Here I agree with Mr Menrad.
To me that is a paradox.
That is something we must never forget.
We all want to acknowledge that.
I agree.
The debate is closed.
Protection of forests
It is quite terrible!

So do not forget them, Commissioner.
A lot of good work has been done there.
We should recognize that.
For that I want to thank you.
They are of particular interest.
We would like that to happen also.
The debate is closed.
That is, excuse me, an elastic clause.
In other words, √† la carte.
This Community structure is a scandal.
What is the Council's reply to this?
What is the Council's reply?
But let me make a second thing clear.
That is not being called into question.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 6.25 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Mr President, on the same point.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Votes
I will therefore vote in favour.
Cornelissen report (A4-0381/96)
Castricum report (A4-0419/96)
Menrad report (A4-0411/96)
EU Transcaucasian strategy
Europe is involved in the region.
Its responsibilities are immense.
I compliment her on it.
What we have is merely a ceasefire.
Thank you very much, Mrs Schroedter.
One thing becomes clear.
I warmly endorse this report.
To this question my reply is 'yes' .
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)

We are arguing here about two years.
We say 1999, they say 2001.
It can ensure quality.
The question is, how to use them.
I think that is the right direction.


Five years - but from which date?
This is not what Europe is about!
We have to consider that too.
I urge you to support them.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
That really is not good enough.
Will you please do something about it?
Thank you, Mrs Crawley.
We should make that quite clear.
Thank you very much, Mr Collins.
Order of business
We now come to the order of business.
Perhaps I could quickly explain why.
That is pointless.
Thank you very much, Mr Nassauer.
Decision on urgency
Thank you very much, Mr Collins.
(Parliament rejected the request)
Urgent political matters
And if so, how?
Where should flexibility apply?
But we should not deceive ourselves.
That is what worries me the most.
There must be a large number of States.
And they convinced me.
The problem is the first pillar.
That is the situation as I see it.
How can the Commission prevent that?
Naturally there are, and I have many.
And there is no vacillation there.
Other issues need to be discussed.

Obviously the risk of division exists.
Take Schengen, for example.
I think that is the wrong procedure.
It would not be against the Treaty.
Thank you very much, Mr Oreja.
Fight against racism
Two points here.
Firstly, education.
We must now speak about it more.
We are looking into this.
So we know plenty of the causes.
Woe betide us if we fail to do so!
That goes without saying.
This situation cannot continue.
I denounce anyone who is a racist!
I denounce anyone who is a xenophobe!
Such rubbish has to be exposed!
That must be our view of things!
Third axis: the media.
What would you feel in this situation?
Racism knows no borders.
I think that it is a nice reply.
This is the end of the discussion, now.
That is point one.
That is an insult!
The debate is closed.
Combating terrorism
Firstly, how do we define terrorism?
That is the definition.
Now for our interpretation.
Political prevention, to begin with.
When will it be ratified?


A blue bond, Mr President.
Mrs Reding has enumerated them.
That is not on and we cannot have it.
It is a serious crime.
We are happy to agree with most of it.
We have to be very clear on that.
Such things are not admissible.
And there is more.
Let there be no mistake about it.
Terrorism cannot be allowed to succeed.
I congratulate the rapporteur on that.
This is all hypocritical.
We must avoid this at all costs.
We must give this task our priority.
What use is state sovereignty?
The debate is closed.
Progress of the EU in 1995
But that will not be enough.
No.
Why not?
The debate is closed.
He was right and I share his concerns.
Europe has many cultures.
For me this is an absurd idea.
Mr President, on a point of order.
It is a fair comment.
I am very sorry.
It is what the report calls for.
But how many people will agree with me?
It is unfortunate and unfair.
Thank you, Mr Evans.
The debate is closed.
Cost of transport
The users are already paying for them.
That must not be allowed to happen.
The use of roads causes damage to them.
Let us consider these aspects first.
It must be more than just talk.
That cannot be what we should be doing!
Let me mention just three.
In most cases not really.
This needs pull-and-push measures.
Let me give you a few figures on CO2 .
It is a laudable objective.
So far, so good.
The debate is closed.
Research and sustainable development
We have had a hearing.
Development of statistics on R and D
Of course, there are many causes.

Thank you, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Application of Community law


This is what this report is about.
A second point.
We would like to see that done at last.
That has subsequently been the case.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(Parliament approved the minutes)
Nobody disputes that, either.
The Commission shares this view.
This is fatal!
It is no longer on the agenda.
This should be our line of conduct.
But this cannot be enough.
So what we have here is a ghost debate.
Article K9 died of its own inadequacy.
I am amazed to hear it.
We must take action.
Is this what we want?
It is unusable.
Indeed we will strive against this.
Why?
I think that I have achieved that.
We no longer have misconceptions.
Votes
On the subject of amendment 3:
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(The President cut off the speaker)
We cannot get into a debate.
This is all quite clear.
The debate on the content is now over.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
It is democracy which is at stake.
Fisheries Council
Thomas report (A4-0414/96)

We consider this to be wrong.
Reding report (A4-0368/96)
Terrorism must be more clearly defined.
We are opposed to such a development.
Europol must not become an 'EU-FBI' .
Valverde L√≥pez report (A4-0396/96)
Escudero report (A4-0410/96)
Schmidbauer report (A4-0012/96)
This text must therefore be supported.
This report is therefore a compromise.
Schaffner report (A4-0001/97)
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 12.30 pm)
Resumption of the session
Membership of Parliament
Mr Hory has the floor.
I congratulate him on his appointment.
Mr President, on a point of order.
It amounts to an abuse of authority.
This question is not on the agenda.
I cannot let you discuss it further.
Order of business
(Parliament approved the request)
Monday and Tuesday
Mrs Green has the floor.
Wednesday and Thursday
There are four reasons for this.
We want a full and thorough debate.
Energy Charter
Russia has yet to ratify it.
We are far from achieving that.
While competition is given high...
That is a very great deal.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Parliament can only say yes or no.
It is, frankly, the best fuel.
This treaty needs tightening up.
It is weak.
Above all it needs monitoring.


I find this an astonishing proposal.
But I will pass on your question.
The debate is closed.
Development problems in Italy
What, or who, is most important here?
I explained it to them all at the time.
Thank you very much, Mrs Wulf-Mathies.
The debate is closed.
Development problems in Germany
We support it entirely.
That really is the crunch.
ECU 32 million to Bavaria.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Cohesion policy and the enviroment
Another point is nature conservation.
And that is detrimental to nature.
That is the billion-dollar question.
So what should we go for?

I think this is a very important issue.
But why?
So I continue to rely on your support.
Thank you, Mrs Wulf-Mathies.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.10 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Decision on urgency
This is not the proper way to proceed.
That is absolutely wrong.
I did nothing of the sort.
Thank you, Mrs Green.
Social security schemes
Then there are the frontier workers.
The debate is closed.
Social protection
But not just to continue.
I entirely agree with this.
That is a point which we will support.
That is outrageous!
There are two ideas that interest me.
All well and good.
Selectivity has very clear limits.
However, discussion is not enough.
There are many problems to be resolved.
This is not the case.
Many say EMU is a barrier to this work.
I do not think so.
I shall be voting in favour of both.
That applies equally to top-up schemes.
Thank you very much.
The debate is closed.
Price indication


What happens then?
What are the criteria we are to choose?
But this is not what I want.
Then there is Amendment No 25.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Votes
That is what I was proposing to do.
Many congratulations to you.
I am referring to the written document.
I put that to the House.
Therefore, I feel we cannot vote on it.
There are two solutions.
What is your view, Mr Dell'Alba?
I can accept the oral amendment.
The amendment was tabled, Mrs McCarthy.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
This is an intolerable situation!
Santini report (A4-0337/96)
That is an open secret.
Podest√† report (A4-0405/96)
Botz report (A4-0002/97)
That concludes voting time.
BSE

That was a strategic mistake.
(Applause)
I have made my choice.
But I am not a populist!
There is still time for you to do so!
It clearly should have.
The Member States did not want them to.
That is untrue.



I see two essential requirements here.
(Applause)
But we are not content with promises.
(Loud applause)
(Applause)

(Applause)
In 1986 BSE was quite unknown.
This was at the start of the disease.
The report leaves no room for doubt.
But that did not happen.
What did happen?
We want actions, not words.
These have always been our demands.
What is to be done?
Will words be matched by deeds?
The two things are connected.
Yes, mistakes were certainly made.
What do we see?
Hypocrisy across the board!
But their hands are not clean.
Parliament was aware of the problem.
But what had they all got to hide?
What were they covering up?
That is what they were protecting.
And what are they protecting today?
He came shuffling his feet.
No one wishes to see that.
Good, or rather bad!
Just a statistical freak?
I can't believe that!
Another coincidence?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Madam President, on a point of order.
Make no mistake about it, Mr Santer.
What is done is done.
Cast your mind back, Mr President.
But I do have two serious doubts.
So there is a need for clarity.
Subsidiarity is not valid.
The chairman understood my position.
At the outset I declare an interest.
Mr Medina referred to this.
I now reiterate that call.
Of course mistakes were made.

(Laughter and applause)
I also listened to you carefully.
Is that what you announced?
What do you mean by examined?
And why are we still waiting for it?
This belongs to Mrs Bonino!
You have often said this.
You have already said this before.
So do something about it!
Do it!
Say that to us!
But you did not do so.
That is really what we need!
In fact we are a 'word factory' !
People have been afraid in the past.
One thing does not prevent the other!
It is justified, inter alia, because:
And why?
You are a man of honour.
Mr Santer, this is a damning report.
All of Europe knows it.
Thank you, Mr B√©b√©ar.
I think the timetable is tight enough.
How many people will be involved?
What will the budget be?
Whom will it really be monitoring?
There was therefore a known risk.
But who should be punished, and how?
That is very important.
The policy has not been adapted to it.
So, was BSE a matter of chance?
Was it an accident?
It was not.
That is not on, believe me!
BSE was not a matter of chance!
And the Union must play its part.
We do eat meat!
We are omnivores, after all.
I hope that has now changed.
Our position is very clear.

Then it lifted the embargo on gelatine.
We cannot stop now.
But that is not enough.
The press was full of this, as we know.
What is to be done?
This is not consistent.
That point has not yet been made today.
I see that as extremely positive.
Thank you, Mr Paisley.
Mr Martens put two questions to me.
What do I mean by that?
I share that concern.
Thank you, Mr Santer.
Question Time (Commission)
Subject: Tax-free sales in the EU
No?
Very well.
Subject: Channel Tunnel safety
Could you confirm that specifically?
I am grateful to the honourable Member.
Have they actually done so?
Can he tell us that?
The procedures are well known to me.
I am grateful to the honourable Member.
Subject: Scandinavian Express Loop
I am very satisfied with that reply.
Subject: Leonardo Programme
Yes, indeed.
Overcapacity causes problems.
It puts pressure on prices.
We have an overall responsibility.
There are a variety of additives.
I hope you can advise me.
I do not know what to do.
We are trying to do that.
It is easy to be an activist.
That leads me to the third point.
It has offered to act as a focal point.
That concludes Question Time.
This is a welcome change.
Why is this?
It is also an environmental project.
This must change in the future.
The debate is closed.
Investor compensation schemes
Small savers scrimp and save.
Without saving we have no investment.
This was obviously necessary.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting closed at 11.20 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Only the President can find that out!
Who took that decision?
That must have been misunderstood.
(Parliament approved the Minutes.)
Topical and urgent debate (objections)
Item I - Human Rights:
I have two points to raise.
Why?
It will be too late to do it later.
Thank you very much, Mrs McKenna.
That crisis is enormous.
Thank you very much.
Today, we have other problems as well.
This is really only a detail.
The causes are manifold.
This situation must be remedied.
Two principles have to be respected.
The system has to work.
We spend ECU 60b annually.
So we are well on our way.

And they complement each other.
I have a few reservations, however.
Is it practicable, what does it cost?
I should be glad to know.
This is not just about BSE.
There are ethical and moral boundaries.
Our institutions have tried to act.
It is never too late to do good.
In this case, it is re-earned.
Allow me to end with one more thought.
These products are in circulation.
Exploratory talks!
The quality of Irish beef is renowned.
This point has been addressed.
The matter is urgent.
I support that.
Things are not as they were.
What is cost here?
The same is true of information.
The BSE crisis changed everything.
It changed the way many people thought.

Twelve characters are more than ample.
The same applies to Amendment 32.
But we must be realistic.
So what is the advantage?
In the end, nothing.
That is all.
There is talk of labelling meat.
Only thus can it work properly.
I thank the Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Voting will take place at noon.
Welcome
Veterinary medicine residues in food
The market was split in two in 1990.
That is not satisfactory.
Mr Bangemann has asked to speak.
The Council has given a commitment.
We can do that at any time.
That is the problem.
It has taken a long time; that is true.
First essential point, deadlines.
I want to make that quite clear.
That is the nub of the problem.
Nobody is asking for that.
It is 12.01 p.m.
Consumer policy priorities (1996-1998)
Thank you, Mr Whitehead.
Welcome
Is labelling compulsory or not?
Is it systematic or not?
(Applause)
But Mr Whitehead knew this perfectly.
Votes
I am sorry.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Applause)
Let us all be very clear.
There is no doubt about that.
Nor is it the fault of the system.
What is the current situation?
The chaos is complete.
How can we get out of this?
More Community agencies!
More Community controllers!
Weiler report (A4-0016/97)
Unfortunately, this is not the case.
It is necessary, but not enough!
It was needed!
This is a necessary stage.
Quite rightly!
We have abstained on those two issues.
Papayannakis report (A4-0037/97)
Mayer report (A4-0022/97)
In my view they are simply unspecific.
We are still waiting for it.
What is the Commission doing?
Why do I make a point of saying that?
Firstly the question of legal redress.
I refer to the Green Paper on food.
Can we perhaps have an answer on this?
Finally, we agree with all the points.
I consider this very dangerous.
It is not referred to anywhere.
Well, that is history.
If so Heaven help us.
That is essential.
At the moment, very little.
Commissioner, this document is bad.
That is what is needed.
So, my dear friends, let us be serious!
I wish her no harm.
I want to see her strong and powerful.
Just one comment, Mrs Bonino.
We have no European specifications.
This is not a worthless document.
The debate is closed.
Green paper on financial services
That is unacceptable.
She has done an admirable job.
We are supporters of the single market.
And then we had our debate.
I had hoped to see some.
That is not covered.
It really is very necessary.
And we have done just that.


Can you confirm that?
How soon is shortly?
Can he tell us a little more?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Union policy towards Algeria
Many of them women and children.
So the Council takes a long-term view.
The Europeans are standing by Algeria.
Cooperation continues.
It still has a credibility problem.
The elections must be free and safe.
We said that in Barcelona.
We say it again and again.
We saw it with General de Gaulle.
He succeeded.
It is also a matter of our credibility.
These networks must be dismantled.
Let us stop lying to each other.
That is our problem.
Let us stop lying.
Why am I saying this?
I do not know.
Should it be excluded?
I am not sure.
What will it lead to?
Nothing.
This support cost dearly.
Untrue!
This burden has become crushing.
What should we do now?
Let us at least agree on that.
Innocent people are targeted.
That is not the position yet.
A great deal is at stake.
The democrats must also be supported.
We need to help.
Efforts must be made in that direction.
That is the kind of action we need.
I repeat, we must act effectively.
Let us do so.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
There is no questioning that.
Take my own country, for example.
The measures are as follows.
This is the so-called STOP programme.
I have taken due note of what she says.
It does not apply to the present.
The cuts will be entered afresh.
Subject: Design of the 'Euro' banknote
Question No 10 by Ulf Holm (H-0085/97)
Subject: Composition of the euro coin
Is the Council aware of this problem?
Subject: Discriminatory age limits

Subject: Hostages in Kashmir
In reply to Mr Lomas I can say this.
After all, it controls Kashmir.
It is absolutely vital.
Thank you for that response.
I hope you can answer this.
Drug abuse is widespread in Europe.
We must use both these methods.
Is it Euratom?
Have the other states been informed?
That concludes Question Time.
Consumer credit
Our Committee believes that we do.
The joint debate is closed.
Recognition of qualifications
But it is not as simple as that.
This directive has another dimension.
This is no great discovery.
But this is not going to be so easy.
That is not what we were elected for.
And what have we got in front of us?
That is fantastic.
She thinks it is still too little.
Far from 'lacking enthusiasm' !
The debate is closed.
The age limit must be removed.
And now to my fourth point.
I am receptive to this!
What happened?
This actually raises two problems.
The first is of a legal nature.
What should we do?
3, or amendment no.
That is just not going to happen.
The translation is wrong.
Sadly I have got nowhere.
Not here.
An employer can do his bit here.
Surely that is not true!
Really that cannot be true!
It is becoming less and less so.
The proposal has two objectives.
How justified it is is debatable.
The procedures are lengthy.
Thank you, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was suspended at 11 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
I am not supporting this motion.
The correction will be carried out.
Thank you very much, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
We have taken note of your remarks.

This is our experience in Scandinavia.
Communication is a public asset.
Part of it can be supplied privately.
This is a growing market.
So mobile phones should be included.
This must also be a universal service.
I do not see that at all.
So where do we still disagree?
But how are we to achieve that?
This is a mistake we must not make.
It happens very quickly.
However, that is not our subject today.
And that should be our starting point.
I have always made that point.
And then you can reduce costs as well.
But that isn't what matters.
That is the first point.
Those are just a few ideas.
Why?
A final word on the WTO question.
That is how things stand today.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
The next item is the joint debate on:
Today, times have changed.
Which brings me to my report.
He is absolutely right.
He also talked about big money.
I congratulate my colleagues.
I believe a good start has been made.
Economics is not a natural process.
Now to the reports.
But that is not what we are doing.
That is the task in store for us.
That is what I fear.
That is annoying.
I think this is an excellent idea.
That is technically possible today.
This applies to the committees, too.
And that is completely wrong!
Well, nothing wrong with that!
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Commissioner Bangemann.
The joint debate is closed.
Votes
The proposal is in two parts.
This created some difficulty.
I am happy to do that.
Before the final vote on the report
Besides, haste is always inadvisable.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
Gebhardt report (A4-0003/97)
This is very important!
Read report (A4-0049/97)
Lindholm report (A4-0046/97)
Whitehead report (A4-0317/96)
These points will determine my vote.
This section of the report is good.
Marinucci report (A4-0048/97)
That concludes voting time.
Thank you very much, Mr Caccavale.
Welcome
BSE (Vote on motion of censure)
We shall now proceed to the vote.
A choice had to be made.
Each of us voted with his conscience.
That is why I abstained in this vote.
I agree with this view.
Both Commissions deserve blame.
I have no confidence in the Commission.
As it is, I have not done so.
I approved of it, and I voted for it.
That is serious.
Why?

Topical and urgent debate
So what do we suggest?
Democracy in Zaire!
We can see how wrong that is.
I had two reasons.
This really is a matter of urgency.
Where do these weapons come from?
Why is nothing done to act on rumours?
What form might that solution take?
We must support the UN's initiatives.
The mercenaries must be pulled out.
That is a major contribution to peace.
Mr Telk√§mper refers to rumour.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
That is like a red rag to a bull.
In Albania there was nothing.
I hear talk of two billion dollars.
A system was in play.
A new economic situation is arising.
What advice is it giving that country?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
This year we need a firm position.
I believe the signs are encouraging.
First, Colombia.
Secondly, Nigeria.
This is a very important subject.
I cannot understand this at all.
Human rights are a universal value.
This will be pursued this year.
This is very important indeed.
Mordechai Vanunu
There have also been many questions.
However, that is in the past.
Vanunu cannot damage Israeli security.
What did he do?
This man is in Syria.
But this House must be realistic.
Chad
I have had a meeting with him.
Indigenous peoples of Indonesia
What matters, I believe, is the result.
Point three: Mr Mordechai Vanunu.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 pm.
This is the last chance for Mostar.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
I shall mention just four.
The figures on violence are shocking.
As a first example, take France.
As a second example, take Germany.
Thank you very much, Mr Rocard.
Patience is not necessarily a virtue.
But we are not united about the means.
Our French colleagues are responsible.
They know what the electors want.
The development of...
(The President cut off the speaker)
What is the purpose of that provision?
(The President cut of the speaker)
I have rarely heard such rubbish!
His wife won the election.
I say that again, unambiguously.
I really feel I have to say that.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
That concludes the debate.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
She deserves our thanks.
We should retain that.
There are choices to be made.

The debate is closed.
Development cooperation policy
Coordination is just not working.
But it does not work.
It is a one-way dialogue.
The Commission gives the information.
And that is a sign of bad coordination.
This is absolutely essential.
In Africa it is as much as 65 %.
I find this extremely worrying.
Mr McGowan included that one too.
That is the real situation.
But what is the actual position?
It is not even on the agenda yet.
NGOs are to get more.
So where does France's interest lie?
There are good reasons.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Relief, rehabilitation and development
A third aspect is that of fund-raising.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I declare the sitting closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.05 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
That will be attended to, Mr Hallam.
That is all I wish to see corrected.
Are there any other comments?
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Votes
Think of the French in Africa.
Fassa report (A4-0021/97)
This proposal must be rejected.
Clearance of EAGGF accounts
This is quite strange.
We disagree with that, Madam President.
We shall not do so this year.
This situation is intolerable.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Assisting spouses of the self-employed
This is 1997.
Why is this?
But where should we start?
To the report.

Thank you, Mr Papoutsis.
Thank you very much, Mrs Lulling.
The debate is closed.
The vote will now be taken.
Before the vote on Amendment No 4
The amendment clarifies this point.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Leghold traps
Mr Collins has the floor.
That was on 9 December.
So Parliament voted for it last year.
It was merely to be agreed.
It has no justification.
I do not accept his reply.
This is not just about trade.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Kellett-Bowman.
It is rather a question of chronology.
Well, it won't do!
These public morals need protection.
This is not admissible in legal terms.
Stop lying, Sir Leon Brittan!
We can discuss the substance of this.
What does the Commission really want?
We reel from one surprise to another.
How on earth is that possible?
I want to make several appeals.
That must be the guiding principle.
You do not know the details.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The vote will now be taken.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Genetically modified maize
Why do I ask for this postponement?
Mr Lannoye, you have the floor.
That is what I have done.
Thank you very much, Mr von Habsburg.
Thank you very much, Mrs Pailler.
Mr President, on a point of order.
That is not a point of order Mr R√ºbig.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 11.30 a.m.)
Resumption of session
(Applause)
I thank you for this statement.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
I shall not comment on that.
(Applause from the ARE Group)
I confirm that to you now.
Thank you very much, Mr Roth.
(Applause)
(The Minutes were approved)
Order of business
The next item is the order of business.
Are there any comments?
(The order of business was adopted)
I call upon Mrs Breyer.
Why?
There is a difference.
It is Parliament that decides.
(Parliament rejected the request)
Wednesday and Thursday (unaltered)
Friday:
This is a second reading.
(Parliament agreed to the request)
Thank you very much, Mr Santini.
Future of Schengen
Thank you very much, Mrs Van Lanker.
That impression is incorrect.
Let's take one example.
Flexibility has been mentioned here.
Flexibility to move forward.
So to move forward, but how?
Here too, I share your views.
My thanks for the compliment.
The debate is closed.
The information society
It must grant the time for them.
There is to be a framework directive.
It offers many opportunities.
The debate is closed.
Lifelong learning
I will give a few examples.

The first is finance.
My second point concerns women.
That was not the case until recently.
The first is demographic change.
The debate is closed.
Operation of aeroplanes
I cannot understand this approach.
Thank you, Mr Monti.
Closing of the session
(The sitting was closed at 8.20 p.m.)
Opening of annual session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
I am not on the attendance register.
Mr President, my name is listed too.
Could you please have my name deleted.
That would settle the matter.
Perhaps this could be amended.
Mr President, I was present.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Decision on urgency
Cloning animals and human beings
We must not be against science.
Cloning animals is also reprehensible.
We must ban that too.
Yet nothing happened.
That is self-evident.
But we must have one in future.
Nature does it by itself.
It is our task to establish that.
And then laws will have to be decided.
This consensus still seems to exist.
We have known about it for 15 years.
This raises a number of questions:
Who has been financing this research?
Governments, or the private sector?
How many more incidents have to happen?
It is time somebody did so.
The technology is important.
It brings benefits: it brings problems.
There is no question about that.
We need to know all these things.
We need to know who the members are.
We need to know how they are appointed.
Of course there are.
It is not.
This was financed at local level.
This is not at all a research problem.
The debate is closed.
Closing of the Renault plant in Belgium
I understand this.
These are very sensitive issues.
Nobody else.
This is not free trade, it is suicide.
So this is the human face of socialism!
That is the economic reality facing us.
What approach should we take?
What is needed here is economic action.
But there is more to it than that.
This is therefore a race we cannot win.
But could the Union be doing more?
This is not a new situation.
I feel like saying: ' I dare you!' .
Tragedies, but nothing new.
But let us not speak in double talk.
Two things.
There are means of pressure.
We must not accept this closure.
That really does require strong action.
No-one else is responsible.
That is always clearly understood.
Let us be clear about that.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Industrial competitiveness
We organized a hearing.

Quite often this also creates new jobs.
One last point and I shall finish.
And where is it struggling?
Rightly so!
Then we will all have lost out.
It should be welcomed.

The UPE group was in favour of urgency.
Votes
I have voted for the report.
Caccavale report (A4-0010/97)
Van Lancker report (A4-0014/97)
I wanted to make those explanations.
We cannot vote for this report.
This we believe is good.
We cannot support this report.
Wim van Velzen report (A4-0045/97)
We are voting for the report.
That concludes voting time .
Thank you Madam President.
I know this is not a popular subject.
I agree fully with Mr Herman.
We must be logical.
I think this is important for Europe.
Let me give you an example.
I think the answer would be no.


We talk about liberalization.
We have had many of those.
It does in the rest of Europe.
That has to be wrong.
So it must be sensibly prepared.
That is only superficially the case.
That is one possibility.
What is wrong with efficiency?
You are quite right, Mr Bowe.
That will not work.
But we can sort that out.
Above all, it requires flexibility.
Mr Jarzembowski is my witness.
Of course there is no sense in that.
Someone said we should be consistent.
I very much agree.
The same applies in the Council.
That is a nonsense.
I come now to the chemical industry.
I do not understand that.
So we had some success with that.
We have several options.
And we will do so.
We have to do this.
The Commission always does that!
Sometimes not!
Thank you, Mr Bangemann.
The debate is closed.
But then what?
Why would anyone want to use it?
The European Union must set benchmarks.
But it is important that we act now.
I congratulate her.
Cymru am byth .
This is a vital issue for Europe.
We must also interlink them.
But this message goes to parents too.
Is there a coordinated, overall plan?
I very much doubt it.
They are all pending.
That is wrong.
That too is nothing but prejudice.
Show us what we can achieve with this!
That can only be useful to us.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Statement by the President
The killer was taken into custody.
Genetically modified micro-organisms
I should like to stress two things:
This must be uniform across the Union.
This is an essential safeguard.
Let me refer to two points.
In my view this caution was justified.
And that is a good thing.
That is one demand.
Thank you Mr President.


We cannot accept that.
We strongly support that.
The report will be sent to Parliament.
That is a major contradiction.
That would mean assuming liability.
I would like your position on that too.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Subject: World Trade Organization
Thank you, Sir Leon.

Muchas gra√ßias, Se√±or Presidente!
Thank you, Mr Commissioner.
Subject: Phare - Poland

Thank you, Mr Van den Broek.
The case is similar for Kirghizstan.
Thank you, Mr Van den Broek.
Subject: The creation of wetlands
Thank you, Mrs Bjerregaard.
Subject: Endocrine-disrupting chemicals
Thank you, Mrs Bjerragaard.
In the late 1970s there were 10 pairs.
Now there are 20 000.
Thank you, Mrs Bjerregaard.
It must be quite easy to answer.
Thank you, Mr Commissioner.
Thank you, Mr Commissioner.
Thank you, Mr Liikanen.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by Mr Crowley (H-0098/97)
Subject: Second-chance schools
Subject: EU and CITES and elephants
If not, why not?
Could you perhaps comment on this?
We are aware of the situation.
Subject: Groupeuro
Question No 9 by Mr Bertens (H-0132/97)
Question No 10 by Mr Wibe (H-0133/97)
Subject: Tax-free sales in the EU
Thank you for that brief reply.
I take note of Mr Wibe's comments.
These countries will be worst hit.
So it cannot be seen in isolation.
Question No 17 by Mr Needle (H-0154/97)
I am sorry, but that did not happen.
Subject: Cot deaths
I cannot comment on it.
It entered a new phase in March 1996.
That concludes Question Time.
Driftnets
I think I should leave it at that.
This has been scientifically proven.
But from whom?
Some updating is needed.
You only have to go and check.
So what arguments are we now left with?
I would just remind you of our report.
Let us make no mistake.
That is the only credible solution.
The turtles, the dolphins, would die!
This poses a problem.
One net, one piece of fishing gear.
Thank you, Mr President.
Something must therefore be done.

But what exactly was your point?

This is really very strange!
These agreements are important.
We take them seriously in Parliament.
So we ought to help them.
I have to stress this.
The joint debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at midnight)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
On what authority?
I am very happy to respond, Mr Andrews.
On his own behalf.
As a Member.
I cannot do anything else.
Not another word on the matter.
(Applause)
My intention was to vote no.
Mr President, the same applies to me.
That will be corrected.
Community Transit System
The next item is the joint debate on:
That is not adequate!
I commend the report to the House.
Thank you, Commissioner.
This is important and constructive.
There should be improved controls.
These are interesting proposals.
(Applause )

We must recognize that.
We must bear it in mind.
No!
So did we do that? No, we did not!
That is the problem.
We did not grasp the whole picture.
Spot checks alone are not enough.
How could this have happened?
Thank you, Mrs Theato.
You are right, Mr Martinez.
Votes
I never indicated any such agreement.
Thank you very much, Mrs Ahern.
Which part does she accept?
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Loud and sustained applause )
Thank you very much, Mrs Green.
(Uproar in the public galleries)
Silence in the gallery!
Silence in the gallery!
Ladies and gentlemen in the gallery!
Ladies and gentlemen in the gallery!
Silence!
So please maintain silence.
Before the vote
Mr Giansily is asking for the floor.
He may speak after the vote.
Parliament's work must be respected!
Leave the Chamber, Mr Giansily!
Ladies and gentlemen, please calm down.
Mr de Vries is asking for the floor.
I want to make that absolutely clear.
Mr Martens has the floor now.
You have the floor, Mr Martens.
Mrs Dury has the floor.
So let us now vote on this resolution.
We were in the process of voting.
We will deliberate and take a decision.
So stop the amateur dramatics!
Let's get on with our job!
We are well paid to do it. Let's vote!
Let's vote!
That is our political responsibility.
That is called democracy.
There are visitors in the gallery.
Out of which quota?
When did he reserve them?
That is a very specific question.
Thank your very much, Mr F√©ret.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Better late than never, Mr President.
It is regarded as a quaint assembly.
Rule 127 is extremely clear.
Thank you, Miss McIntosh.
It was not outrageous.
Thank you, Mr Corbett.
Thank you, Mr Pasty.
Thank you, Mr Cox.
You criticized Mrs Green.
But you did then call Mr Konrad.
Mr Konrad saw fit to be provocative.
Let us come back down to earth!
I utterly repudiate that!
That, I believe, speaks for itself!
It was nothing other than that.
Is that not the same sort of thing?
That is my last word on the exercise.
You are right, Mr Bourlanges.
I do not agree.
Soulier report (A4-0065/97)
Arias Ca√±ete report (A4-0061/97)
Cunha report (A4-0013/97)
And new species have been included.
Macartney report (A4-0385/96)
Waddington report (A4-0056/97)
That violation must not go further.
They also represent power.
Renault factory
I voted against the motion.



Enough crocodile tears!
A talented choir, but a religious one.
(The President cut of the speaker)
Community Transit System (continuation)
It is a weak link in the system.
We now have this report.
One needs just to read the report.
But I have a couple of points to make.
So far, this has not been the case.
New technology is a must.
I myself am terribly alarmed.
Most Member States retain more.
Something has to be done about this.
But further work needs to be done.
It is not a bad aim for Europe.
My compliments to it for this.
Nor must they be.

Thank you, Mr Tomlinson.
The debate is closed.
Albania
The Government cannot do so.
There have been killings and woundings.
And I have my reasons.
I was in Albania myself.
I also spoke to President Berisha.

Unfortunately, you took no heed of us.
However, we must persist.
The problem is indeed a political one.


He shares the blame for the pyramids.
This must not happen.
And that is not all.
He could answer me with one word.
The debate is closed.
Welcome
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen!
(Applause)
Follow-up to the Barcelona Conference
This is not a bolt-on addition.
And I totally repudiate that statement.
Barcelona cannot go against itself.
I am optimistic about that.
The intentions are good.
I hope that this will change.
We must never forget that!
Much remains to be done.
Barcelona is only a baby.
Barcelona is one and a half years old.
That is already a step forward.
I repeat, this is a long term process.
Much remains to be done.
We have a budget for the forum.
Thank you, Mr Mar√≠n.
The debate is closed.
Is that true?
I am asking the Commission.
Parliament is concerned about this.
But can we have a thousand Schengens?
Obviously not!
How so?
Lastly, what does unified systems mean?
We should be glad to know about that.
Our resolution clearly shows that.
In conclusion, I see two alternatives.

We will continue to fight for that.
That is one point.
How can things go on like this?
There is no more time to lose!
That is a disgrace.
Does that cost too much as well?
I feel desperately let down.
The second point is flexibility.
We are increasingly worried about this.
They are not even at orange.
They are red.
And red is the colour of shame.
Things are looking bad for the IGC.
Let me give three examples.
Why?
Because we are a nuisance.
Because it is a nuisance!
We need to enliven our act.
You know the Commission's position.
It is the same as Parliament's.
I do not entirely agree.
I think that is essential.
This is an open question.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Budget guidelines for 1998
Fair enough: we await their proposals.
I visited today Parliament's web-site.
I commend the report to the House.
My second point is on energy.
They give four priority areas.
The subject is an important one.
These points have been made by others.
Finally, agriculture remains important.
Not a word on all that, Mr Tillich!
Qu'est-ce qu'on doit √©valuer?
Thank you, Mr Dell'Alba.
It is stable or even declining.
It is an extremely strong signal.
That increase is unrealistic.
They move jobs.
What happened?
Moving on to the substance.
I have to say that this is unrealistic.
National governments spend 46 %.
I think this is unrealistic.
These are important.
I sincerely hope we will.
We worry too much.
It was a six-year programme.
Thank you, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
North/South cooperation to combat drugs
What are we doing?
Are we serious?
I have no more to say.
Anyway, thank you.
Thank you, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.


, Vice-President of the Commission.
Thank you, Mr Mar√≠n.
The debate is closed.
Our message is relatively simple.
So the money is there.
Speed is now essential.
And the European Union adds value.
There is a multiplier effect.
It is forward-looking.
It is the committee that found it.

This is a sensible report.
One thing really amazes me in all this.
What has become of our package?
My Group is not in agreement with that.
Something is seriously amiss here.
We shall abstain.
That makes 200 million.
Finally, a word about the timetable.
Thank you, Mrs Cresson.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Mr President, I refer to page 14.
Am I going to get a reply? If so, when?
I will be very brief.
I hope that it is not true!
I would request a reply.
When do you think that reply might be?
Thank you, Mr President.
That action was not carried through.
What should be done in such cases?
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
This country needs our help.

Everyone knows that.

We are doing our best.
We need to go further.
It is a job for experts.
The prospects for this are very varied.
And what is that?
That must be constantly emphasized.
The debate is closed.
Welcome
(Applause)
Votes
Amendment No 6 :
That is all.
(The amendment was withdrawn)
Amendment No 13 :
Amendment No 11 :
(The oral amendment was accepted)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
You all have the text in front of you.
I would like to reply to Mr Sch√§fer.
Could you confirm that?
It replaces the whole paragraph.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
Amendment No 14 :
(The oral amendment was accepted)
Before the final vote :
(The oral amendment was rejected)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I consider this unacceptable.
Could that be looked at by the Bureau?
It leads to a lot of confusion.
Linkohr recommendation (A4-0084/97)
Alan J. Donnelly report (A4-0552/97)
Langen report (A4-0040/97)
Europe is truly at a crossroads.
Katiforis report (A4-0030/97)

Why does this fraud exist?
This level of fraud is intolerable.
I approve of these proposals.

A 'before' and an 'after' .

IGC
But what do we actually find?
Welcome
Topical and urgent debate
Why?


Thank you, Commissioner Mar√≠n.
The debate is closed.
Israel is playing with fire.

The first is inaccuracy.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Kosovo
Argentina
This involves the press.

, Vice-President of the Commission.
The solution has been a positive one.
The debate is closed.
That's just one example among many.
I should just like that to be noted.
, Vice-President of the Commission.
The debate is closed.
Earthquake in Iran

Well, silence perpetuates oppression.
Storm in the Azores
Fortunately there were no deaths.
And yet there is no proposal on this!

The debate is closed.
We shall begin the votes at 5.30 p.m.
Votes
We can hardly ask it to violate them.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Welcome
Votes (continuation)
On the Kittelmann report (A4-0031/97)
On the Schwaiger report


On the Chesa report
That only leads to paralysis.
In others, it is called survival.

This must be changed!
This is an excellent report.
This, for us, is a fundamental aspect.
That point has already been made.
Now we can see the reality.
Not even Rio could agree on that.
We rejoiced at Rio.
Today, we are disappointed.
We have hopes of New York.
Perhaps this is our last chance.
That is wrong!
We have to recognize this fact.
The debate is closed.
Withdrawal of GSP from Myanmar
Action against Burma is well overdue.
This is just not acceptable.
I warmly support Mrs Theorin's report.
Thank you, Mr President.
The opposite has happened.
We videoed an interview with her.
Two final points.
, Vice-President of the Commission.
The reason for this?
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.05 pm)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Ken would be pleased.
Thank you for this information.
Madam President, on a point of order.
Thank you very much Mr Hallam.
Thank you very much Mr Vallv√©.
Thank you very much Mr Sichrovsky.
Votes
Dybkj√¶r report (A4-0083/97)
What do I want them to be told?
Rapid answers are therefore needed.
Fundamental changes are needed.
But there are many others.
They do not solve the whole problem.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Guarantee against losses for EIB loans
(Laughter)
Hope springs eternal!
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, on a point of order.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is not the time for speeches.
The Rules of Procedure do not allow it.
RTD cooperation with emerging economies
You can argue it both ways.
Somebody mentioned human rights.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mr President, on a point of order.
The demographic situation

What is happening?
The sooner the better, in fact.
Old Europe will be full of old people.
New types of housing are required.
Education has already been mentioned.
Society must also play a part.
Is our position in danger?
Can they be used to develop strategies?
Their numbers are growing considerably.
Experience is becoming a handicap.
I will come straight to the point.


Only God can give health.
So what has happened in the meantime?

Or has it?
Now we come to pensions.
So what are the Member States doing?

First of all, the cultural one.
We really must favour family life.
Mrs Banotti wishes to speak.
I would ask Mr Bangemann to be patient.
You have the floor, Mrs Banotti.
Thank you very much for the invitation.
My mother died a month ago.
We have to think about this.
This applies to both men and women.
I should like to hear him say that.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Total deadlock.
Thank you Mr Ford.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Adjournment of the session
We have completed our business.
(The sitting was closed at 12 noon)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
And why?
Not a serious crime.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I am sorry, but it must be so.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you, Mr Balfe.
(The Minutes were approved)
But they are not doing so!
That is my intention.
Order of Business
Thank you very much, Mrs Theato.
One month later, where do we stand?
What is at stake is too serious.
A completely new situation has emerged.
The situation has completely changed.
(Parliament rejected the request)
Thursday and Friday:
(No proposed amendments submitted) .
It is a very sensitive political issue.
I think this would be wrong.
Very well, Mrs Lindholm.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
We have never tried this tactic before.
'Draft measures' could mean anything.
Why not?
Who collects the statistics?
Where do they come from?
We found it in a pine forest.
I have referred to my notes.
Parliament is against the idea as well.
We already have enough of them anyway.
Remember the leghold traps!
But what are they?
We have ample opportunities.
This statistic was published in 1997.
The debate is closed.


And what of consumers in all this?

How can we improve the controls?

Mr President, on a point of order.
I am somewhat confused.
The Commission has thus learnt nothing.


We can reject this advice.

That must in any event be respected.
Two plus two will always equal four.
They are rarely absolute.
They may not have yet seen enough.
I do not want retrospective banning.
None of this has been done.
Secondly: the question of labelling.
Thirdly: the question of GATT.
This is the fundamental question.

No, quite the opposite.
But there is research and research.

I believe this is what we have done.
We did take account of them.
We wanted to obtain further assurances.
I agree with this view.
The joint debate is closed.
It always poses a risk.
It is also why the article has to stay.
They are in fact the crucial point.
What is happening today?
Have I understood her correctly?
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.41 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Madam, that is what generally happens.
Mr Rack, I will reassure you doubly.
Are there any other comments?
Could it be recorded, please?
In any case we will check.
(The Minutes were adopted)
I totally reject what he said.
This freedom alone is not enough.
In fact, they died of poverty.
This report is accused of being biased.
In 1997, we must not fall behind him.
We cannot afford this in the long term.
You have forgotten redheads!
17 articles, not 171!
Of course, our Europe is not perfect.

It is for that that I thank Mrs Roth.

There is everything and its opposite.
This report really is in need of it.
It no longer has that purpose.
It has a political agenda.
And that is precisely its weakness.
There are some examples of this too.
I should like to propose a way out.
What hypocrisy!
A political conception of human rights?
So, let's stop the hypocrisy!
Power can be abused by the State.
How can it be neglected, therefore!
They were invented subsequently.
That is the public's real concern.
The debate is closed.
However, today is a first.
This is quite important.
That should apply across the board.
We support Mr Ford in his proposals.


I recognize the point he is making.
I do however take your point.
The debate is closed.
Growth, employment and convergence
It is high time for this to happen.
It is too narrow in scope.
What about investment levels?
Now to the problems.

Economic, but not solely economic.
So why this languor?
In all, global investment is trailing.
You can smell professionals at work.
It is a factor of social regression.
We now come to voting time.
Votes
On paragraph 39
On Amendment No 3
An Amendment No 3 has been tabled.
The rapporteur has not requested it.
On Amendment No 15
That is incorrect.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
No.
It is absurd!
This problem must be corrected.
Otherwise we will get nowhere.
Some very large interests are at stake.
Roth report (A4-0112/97)
So do I.
But that is not the case here.
Racism and xenophobia are spreading.
But that is not the point.
This cannot be tolerated.
That is the end of voting time.
We know why this is.
The Commission has no answer to this.
Why?
The Socialists say yes.

Which laurels, Mr Four√ßans?
Where did you find them?
Economics is not an exact science.
Where will it end?
The debate is closed.

Why?
I do not think so.
I agree with Mr Herman.
We do not owe them solidarity.
They do not show us solidarity.
That is perfectly logical.
I do not like the back door.
And what do we mean by national upsets?
That is still unconfirmed speculation.
I cannot give you any solutions today.
The debate is closed.
Competitiveness of European industry
What firm would want to do that?
America's share is also falling.

That is very true.
Who disagrees?

What is benchmarking?
Firstly, at the level of undertakings.
That can be a very great help.
That was already happening.
Germany has already been mentioned.
That is a simple fact.
It has nothing to do with ideology.
That is what benchmarking is.
The debate is closed.
Driving licences
That strikes me as common sense.
We often talk about subsidiarity.
That amendment should be accepted.
So far, so good.
Now we are talking about 1 July 1997!
And so it must remain!
This is the nub of the matter!
I am an English lawyer.
I have to beg your indulgence.
That is what I would assume.
Then we can discuss it again.
Then we would not get a result.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
These two conditions have now been met.
That objective has been achieved.
Now we will be there as well.
Subject: Norwegian salmon dumping
Subject: Panam Project
Thank you Commissioner.
I am interested in what you say.
That is good.
Question No 37 by Mr Howitt (H-0224/97)
I have a very simple question.
It is clear that there has been damage.
Could you confirm that was the case?
I do not agree with the last point.
That is not an available option.
That will be done.
Are the prices dumped prices?
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
Subject: Regional policy in Ireland
Question No 42 by Mr Titley (H-0262/97)
I have two questions.
That is the arrangement at present.
Question No 47 by Mrs Thors (H-0209/97)
Subject: Antibiotics in pig feed
I think that this is only logical.
Sweden has agreed to that.
Question Time is closed.
Exactly what is it all about?



However, I do not wish to go into that.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I think not.
Let us lead by example.
We must lead by example.
We need more than that.
First point: accessibility.
Second: consolidation.
I would say not.
Thank you very much, Mr commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We are the thin line.
We support you.
Get on with it!
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Resale rights
It is important to bear that in mind.
It is just a method of delay.
If he was honest, he would admit that.
Again, we should be sceptical of that.
We need this harmonization.

My starting point is simply this.
This is not a harmonization measure.
This freedom must be respected.
I would like to make a forecast.

This directive is a very important one.
People cannot live on that.
Is that fair?
I hardly think so!
No mention has been made of this.
Clearly, harmonization is required.
Such an idea is madness!
That is what will happen!
The debate is closed.
Masses and dimensions of motor vehicles
I hope this is considered to be minor.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
That will be corrected.
(Parliament approved the Minutes.)
Budget discharge
Another example relates to olive oil.
And so it goes on.
I have a problem on this.
A few words more on the main budget.
That is a grave matter.

It is a priority for all of us.
The Council is worried by this.
That is unacceptable!
The problem is alarming.

That is very far in advance of 1998.
The debate is closed.
Tensions are running high.
We have exercised caution.
And Europe?
Pressure will achieve nothing here.
Nothing can justify terrorism.
The next few days will be crucial.

But this is not enough.
I have two points to make.
I therefore support it.
The second thing is the peace process.
It is a very serious matter.
Thirdly, La Valetta.
That happened on Maundy Thursday.
Mr Patijn's reasoning is correct.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Statement by the President
We congratulate them.
Votes
Sadly, this amendment was defeated.
The art market is global, not European.
Ford report (A4-0110/97)
It ought to put its own house in order.
This report is no exception.
There are several reasons for this.
Randzio-Plath report (A4-0111/97)
The others were not spared either.
So what is the explanation?
We have abstained in the final vote.
Sweden is an excellent example of this.
Let us be clear on one thing.
Metten report (A4-0105/97)
Unfortunately, it is too hesitant.
Situation in Albania
Probably a pretty unenviable task.
Finally there is humanitarian aid.
The need now is for action.
The Albanian people need us.
We cannot do that!
Every day counts.
What has actually been done?
Because that is what the game is.
So accept the message!
This situation will not die away.
Anyway, we are willing to do our part.
The problem is one of trust.
That mistrust is very understandable.
He lacks all credibility.
And the mayor fell.
Why this continued tolerance?
The debate is closed.
Situation in Hong Kong
Thank you Mr President.
People who do so do not help Hong Kong.
That is the key point.
Britain's rule will end.
I just have two further points.
The debate is closed.
That assertion is false.
For the United States and Japan.

We also need a realistic test.
Question Time (Council)
Yes.
It is the individual Member States.
The talks are now in the final phase.
Subject: The cost of enlargement
That seems to me largely speculative.
I will leave it at that.
Question No 4 by Mr Newens (H-0210/97)

And that is and remains the objective.
It was one aspect of that.
Question No 6 by Mr Pirker (H-0218/97)
Subject: Europol
If so, which ministers?
What are their objections?
That is a long and complicated process.
Subject: Poland
That is my feeling.
Question No 8 by Mr McMahon (H-0220/97)
Question No 9 by Mr Howitt (H-0223/97)
Question No 10 by Mr Lomas (H-0226/97)
Would the Council not agree with that?
Perhaps that will reassure you.
It is not for the Council to comment.
This is why I asked the question!
I should like to leave it at that.
Mr Speciale raises an important issue.
Are they being specifically organized?
Have there been improvements already?
I myself do not believe that.
Then there really would be a conflict.
That is one thing I know for sure.
My thanks to Mr Patijn for his answer.
That is stipulated in the Treaty.
Question Time is closed.
Certain points need highlighting.

Thank you Madam President.
He has prepared some words for me.

But there are technical reasons too.


But two groups are in confrontation.
The oil industry is hostile to that.

Two personal points if I may.
In April, in Strasbourg, it is summer.
That is certainly not its objective.
This requires further examination.
I call Mr Lange.
The debate is closed.
Discrimination based on sex


I think that this is unfortunate.
That sex happens to be the female one.

I am just wondering that out loud.
Problems still remain.
All the others have over-run.
Commissioner Flynn has the floor.
You have my total support for that.
Let me turn to the amendments.
I have taken note of that.
I do not think that is the case.
We have the case law already in place.
That is surely fair.
I would like to thank her for it.
Are there any comments?
(Parliament approved the Minutes.)
Credit institutions
The debate is closed.
Conservation of fishery resources
Thank you Mr President.
The technical capacity is there.
Why?
That is the objective.






This can be done.
So we have a grave problem here.
All this is understandable.

They were totally disregarded!
What are we doing here today?
This is totally wrong!
There is no conservation dividend.
Give the Irish a fair deal!
Thank you Madam President.
I want to thank Mr Adam for his report.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Diversification for Italian fishermen
I call the Commissioner.
I call Mr G√∂rlach.
That is not the main issue.
Mr Imaz San Miguel on a point of order.
No, that should have been moved before.
Mr Tamino on a point of order.
Please accept that fact.
I am sorry about that.
Fisheries management in the Baltic
Thank you, Mrs Langenhagen.
I hope that this can be corrected.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.

May I ask for a vote on that?
Mrs M√ºller, it is quite clear.

Dankert report (A4-125/97)
Mam√®re report (A4-96/97)
Lange report (A4-116/97)
We must act!
This is an example we should follow.
Urgent measures are required.
It is a logical sequence of events.
Gonz√°lez √Ålvarez report (A4-117/97)
This must change.
Ghilardotti report (A4-115/97)
Is that the outcome we want?
British women beware!
Men suffer from it too.
And therein lies the whole problem.
Where then does this problem come from?
This is the explanation for everything.
I hope the IGC will achieve this.
In any case reality requires it.
Resolution on Albania
Resolution on Hong Kong
Topical and urgent debate
Freedom is for everyone.
None of this is in place at the moment.
That is really what is needed here.
Russia is not a dictatorship.
Russia is on the road to democracy.
The negotiations are under way today.

There will be no problem, Madam.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
Is this new government legal or not?
We know nothing about it.
In brief, we are terribly behind.
All this is becoming grotesque!
There is no access!
All this seems desperately late to me!
It is a very serious issue.
It really is a most unlikely situation.
How to react?
The joint debate is closed.
The situation is scandalous.
That leaves me utterly dismayed.
I watched from the beginning.
I have nothing to ask of Mr Denktash.
Turkestan/China:
New factors are added every day.
We shall therefore abstain from voting.
What is the proof?
Where is your evidence?
Situation in Russian prisons:
That is one point.
Laos:
Bosnia-Herzegovina:
Situation in Cambodia:
His attempts have been frustrated.
One policeman was killed.
Thank you, Mr Mar√≠n.

The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Why?
Thank you, Mr Mar√≠n.

What are these problems?


That is the view of the Commission.

(The sitting was closed at 6.40 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
That will be corrected.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Thank you for that helpful comment.
Thank you, Mr Kerr.
Votes
This freedom does not actually exist.
This is one starting point.
I find this outrageous.
I think we owe that to disabled people!
The norm is able-bodied males.
Mainstreaming puts an end to this.
That is why mainstreaming is important.
Do you know why this should be?
That is also very important.
The debate is closed.
We shall proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Integration in developing countries

One final point.
First, historical reasons.
There are conflicts large and small.
This is a challenge for us.
I want to concentrate on Africa.
The debate is closed.
We shall proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Crisis in the rice sector
Why have we got into such a situation?

How will the situation develop?
What are the details of this decision?
Will it accept the Commission decision?

Now it is the turn of rice.
What is the Commission doing about it?
What about Community preference?
Why the price crisis?
What measures is the Commission taking?
What are the producers supposed to do?
It looks for the easiest way out.
It is simply not fair.
Just think about it.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Why?
Are any twelve Members against?
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
The rice sector in the EU has problems.
I take responsibility for that.
Adjournment of the session
Resumption of session
Decision on urgency
Thank you very much, Mrs Malone.
Let me first explain the situation.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you very much, Mr Wijsenbeek.
(Applause from the ARE Group)
He has his figures wrong.
(Mixed reactions)
(The Parliament adopted the decision)
Equal opportunities for men and women
The exact rate is 49 %.




And employment first of all.
There, Mr President, a brief survey.
I think that is far too little.
This is what we must work towards.
We have established some rules on this.
Thank you very much, Mr Santer.
Economic policy and excessive deficits
Growth should rise to 2.4 % in 1997.
We had predicted 2.3 % in the Autumn.
This is beginning to bear fruit.
I really do believe that.

There is no discrimination.
That is quite normal.
That is the Treaty.
What are the practical implications?
We must continue along these lines.
Mrs Randzio-Plath asks three questions.
Last comment on the policy mix.
Is that a major cause of it?
These are ready-made formulae.
There is no difference in approach.
I think we should remain very vigilant.
Secondly, inflation is still at 2 %.
Thank you very much, Mr de Silguy.
I think that needs to be stressed.
My Group is in favour of that.
So it was counterproductive.
This is what worries me most.
We are all websites now.
There is a danger of thought-police.
Thank you, Mr Bangemann.
The debate is closed.
Small and medium-sized undertakings
Then we have the integrated programme.
The Commission does not do this.
My next point is this.
But gradually I have had enough of it.
I will mention some of them.
I will come back to that in a moment.
What we need is clarification.
Getting jobs is our Holy Grail.
Why?
And jobs are what we want.
That is not the real issue.
But that is not the main reason.
But what do we find?
Is this not provocation?
Third, as regards tourism.
The debate is closed.
Adjustment of the financial perspective
This was not a problem in the past.
It was simply a technical procedure.
None at all.
The reason for this is simple.
That does not seem to me a good policy.
And this is no accident.
The debate is closed.
Safety regime for fishing vessels
Let us help it to become a reality.
I am very pleased to do so.
I very much regret that.
The debate is closed.
Vessels carrying hazardous goods
I hope we can move forward.
The debate is closed.
New maritime strategies
Competition there is extremely fierce.
However we face a stark challenge.
We compliment Mr Danesin on his work.
Why?
The Netherlands has shown the way here.
They are interdependent.
We have our European port state.
Let me follow on from this.
I await your answer with some suspense!
I will touch on two points.
Firstly, flagging out.
This needs to be vigorously opposed.
They will be produced very shortly.
The debate is closed.
UK structural measures
It is not my personal report.
This is failure, not success.
It is not a success story.
We have just heard a sample.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
That must be resolved.
Centralization in London does not work.
These have been a great success.
I have one point of criticism.
Why is this?
This is ridiculous.
It is wrong and we should say so.
This is not a partisan report.
The debate is closed.
Development of ultra-peripheral regions




Never mind, let them have support.
Thank you very much, Mrs Wulf-Mathies.
The debate is closed.
Budget discharge
I am sorry the Council is not here.
Firstly, the matter of staffing.
The second issue is that of buildings.
This brings me to my last point.
Finally, I congratulate Mr Van Rens.
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
That has not occurred.
Mr President, can I be blunt.
That is why I am cross.
The joint debate is closed.
Fisheries restructuring


That is the simple truth!
It was impossible to get a majority.
Thank you very much, Mrs Bonino.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)
Euratom-US cooperation agreement
That is not the citizens' Europe!
That is a curious procedure.
Yet we have to take note of it.
I am saying that quite openly.
I am saying that quite openly too.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
We shall be voting for the agreement.
More than 1, 000 cases are still open.
We need to stand very firm on this.
You made a particular request to me.
The debate is closed.
Impact assessment system for firms
May I commend the report to the House.
We can surely all agree on that.
Service is our success.
The debate is closed.
Aid to shipyards
They have not received any of the aid.
What kind of logic is that?
It is pure selfishness.
This is not European cooperation.
All of these possibilities remain open.
That is the fact of the situation.
The debate is closed.
Welcome

Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Mr President, I rise under Rule 3.
Article 9 relates to religious freedom.
This is totally unacceptable.
Finally a letter arrived, in French.
Or perhaps in another language?
I cannot answer you off the cuff.
Here too no provision is made for MEPs.
Very well.
We shall take note, Mrs Eisma.
Order of business
We fully endorse that objective.
Tuesday:
Wednesday:
My warmest congratulations on that.
This is why we put down this request.
Thursday and Friday (no change)

Legal protection for encrypted services
The debate is closed.

That is why we are here.
We welcome it.
That is the nub of the matter.
And who sits in the Council?
This is not the case.
There is no real danger of that.
Yes to subsidiarity.
Why?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
That seems selfevident.
I refer to Amendments Nos 1 and 12.
The second matter is more substantial.
It concerns Amendment No 12.
We agree on that.
Just a few comments, however.
Nor do we like Amendment 12.
We prefer Amendment 14.
I will make only two comments.
The debate is closed.
Amendment of Rule 116
I rather doubt that.
The debate is closed.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Mr President, to clarify the Minutes.
Mr Hallam, I take note of your comment.

Decision on urgency
Welcome
Unfortunately, this was not the case.
So Member States must be supportive.
We can argue for financial stimulants.
We see that as essential.
Autarchy is a bad thing.

Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.

Agriculture and producer groups

Maybe it is different in her country.
A fine performance indeed!

Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.

This procedure is repeated every year.
Your approach is the right one.
That is the procedure.
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
It relates to that very difficult area.
Amendment No 3 deals with openness.
Thank you very much, Mrs Bjerregaard.
The debate is closed.
Biocidal products
It cannot be right for us to do this.
What is it ashamed of?
Our group fully endorses it.
But we can see that this is not so.
This seems to be quite logical.
Thank you very much, Mrs Bjerregaard.
The debate is closed.

Community environmental law
So there is a problem.
Having now done so I have kept my word.
Enforcement can be a complex task.
So we do have a problem.
It is quite simple.
Nobody explains what that means.
My three points are as follows.
It could then be debated.
Rules are laid down but not obeyed.
Is it implemented?
Mr Blokland made this point too.
This had informal beginnings.
I think this would be a good idea.
I can hardly cope with three!
Of course, transposition periods vary.
Let us begin at Community level.
Portugal is no exception.
And that is what I intended to be!
The debate is closed.
Dangers of ionizing radiation
Why do we want to change it?

However, they are worth repeating.
However, we can go further.
What is involved here, Mr President?
The debate is closed.
Thank you very much for your attention.

But they are much more too.
Why is that?
This, however, is not enough.
There are also viruses on the networks.
That was when this idea was born.
To that extent, I agree with you.
That does not exist today.
There is no global infrastructure.
That is not the job of the Union.
Let me make two further remarks.
Perhaps it could be done.
It is just like collective bargaining.
And then agreement is reached on 3.5 %.
Where do we go from here?

The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Subject: Import tariffs
(Interruption for technical reasons)
Just one moment, Mr Mar√≠n.
You must wait until it is put right.
So I withdraw.
But that is not what is lacking.
That is the problem.
Question No 36 by Mr Newens (H-0309/97)
Subject: Trade with Cuba
Subject: Trade with Cuba
Subject: Humanitarian aid to Cuba
How are we doing that?
You have understood right.
It is indeed possible.
Undoubtedly we are not.
That is all that I can say.
Is he taking that into consideration?
Hunterston is in my constituency.
Subject: Public services charter
This is all I would like confirmed.
I thank Mr McMahon for raising this.
So we are working hand in hand.
We are open-minded about it.
Subject: Transport subsidies to Volvo

And that is exactly the situation here.
have any negative impact.
That is the context.
For the rest, we have nothing to hide.
This is still the same subject.
That is what happened.
That is all I can say.
So a solution had to be found.
This happened some time ago.
This has gone on for months.
This is very, very serious.
Remember Vilvoorde!
We have applied the rules coherently.
That has to be made clear.
So that is out of the question.
The question time is closed.
The Commission was true to its word.
At the time I refuted it.

Why have I done so?
The joint debate is closed.
Obstacles to transnational mobility
That runs through the report.
Why?
This leads to social inequality.
Thank you, Mr President.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.28 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were adopted)
That is just not acceptable.
I note your request.
Topical and urgent debate (objections)
I do not understand, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
We are not adding an item.
(The motion was rejected)
Decision on urgency
Common security policy
I had to say that.
What is our position?
What is our policy?
Thank you, Mr Tindemans.
We feel this is extremely important.
We do not agree with this.
We do not agree with this either.
Europe must remain a civil power.
That is what your report suggests.
Essentially I want to say two things.
There can be no doubt about this.
I do have my doubts about this.
It must be faced head on.
I now turn to the matter of drugs.
I feel like saying 'at last!'
We must shoulder our responsibilities.
That is our historic opportunity.
My answer is yes .
Austria has to make up its mind!
Did you know that?
That is racism.
'You do not belong here' they are told.

The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at noon.
Defence-related industries
Now why is this important?
Now we need action.
I do not think so.
What needs to be done now?
That covers everything.
This is extremely important.
We wish you every success.
This is perhaps the point of no return.
A defence identity in relation to whom?
The Cold War is over.
Who is going to pay for that?
Mr Kittelmann referred to this.
How cynical can you get?
Next, there is the arms trade.
Arms are not washing powder.
All this has been said repeatedly.
We have overcapacity.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This must stop.
Let us not extinguish them so soon.
It means a common armaments policy.
It is in fact a very special activity.
We must guard against two temptations.
Who could possibly object to that?
Let us hope that this can be rectified.
Thank you very much, Mrs van Putten.
The debate is closed.

K. Collins Report (A4-0109/97)
Todini Report (A4-0148/97)
Tindemans Report (A4-0162/97)
This means that we are advocating:
That is simply disgraceful.
Better late than never!
This does not make sense.
All very impressive!
Such a proposal is totally insensitive!
(The President cut off the speaker)
Is that what we really want?
I hardly think so.
We should leave things up to them.
This is an idea correct in principle.
What did we find?
What should we do?
Not at all.
The debate is closed.
Improving the impact of joint actions
Two battles have been joined here.
One is the external battle.
That opinion is now available.
These are my brief remarks today.
The debate is closed.
We need to de-link issues.
And that is how things should remain.
We must support them in this respect.
This does not seem acceptable to me.
I have almost finished, Mr President.
Why?
We no longer have that excuse!
Who are they?
Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
Situation in Zaire
It is a good text.
And what are we seeing now?
I shall make no comment on that.
That must be the decisive factor.


What can we demand?
Nothing, of course.
What can we hope for?
What is going to happen now?
Well done, Mrs Bonino!
We must go further.
That is actually what happened.
Thank you very much, Mrs Bonino.
Our Rules strictly prohibit that.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
Subject: Cohesion Fund
You determine the procedure here.
Question No 3 by Mr Wibe (H-0305/97)
A young person from the Maghreb cannot.
This is a serious responsibility.

Subject: Cuba and the Helms-Burton Act
Subject: Cuba and the Helms-Burton Act
Subject: Cuba and the Helms-Burton Act

Subject: The US Helms-Burton Law
Subject: Synthetic drugs
Europol is intergovernmental.
Mr President, on a point of order.
My question was next.

The sitting is resumed.

I am happy to support this report.
That is the nature of the beast.
We have talked to the local people.
My final point concerns consultation.
People criticise us for various things.
We have to stop this process somewhere.
We must stop this kind of subsidy.
This is particularly important.
I have to ask some questions.
That would seem strange.
Why about the fishing industry?
This is a good report.
I hope people will support it.
The proposal has three objectives.




So what is to be done?
On the contrary.
But this has its limits.
Thank you very much, Mr President.


So we have a solid package.

It is a social obligation.
Those are the facts.
These are extraordinary statistics.
This cannot be right.
I cannot understand Amendment No 2.
I think the answer is obvious.
This is not true.
This is not correct.
Everybody has his own responsibility.
I was not born then.
And others bought them.
And I cannot prevent that.
So please take an initiative.
So, why do we not try?
That is the point.
We can try to evaluate it, if you want.
I have tried to make some points.
Take Namibia, for example.
What is wrong with that?
Mozambique is in the same position.
(Applause)
My report is supposed to try and help.
She is right to do so.
The two go together.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.00 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Nuclear industries
It has, however, done so.
That would save a bit of time.
It can never be the task of the EU.
Why not?
She was wrong.
Mr Soulier is wrong.
This cannot be accepted as it stands.
That is a bit much!
Indeed fears are growing here.
That is not disposal.
I shall mention just two.
This is simply untrue.
What are the alternatives?
We are all aware of that.
And we need work.
I refer to high technology.
Exactly the opposite is needed.
I would have written a similar report.
And now to the technology itself.
That is utter nonsense.
There are a number of examples of this.
Why?
They spread .
A lot of money is at stake here.
Yet we happily go on producing.
Let us remember Chernobyl.
The debate is closed.
Renewable energy sources
It would create jobs across the EU.
It is a fundamentally important issue.
That is the future.
European citizens know that.
It is noncontroversial.
A study on this is under way at STOA.
I agree with you!
Let us say no more about that.
Words and more words, but no deeds!
That is an important pillar.
Here we could achieve 35 %.
Then you will have my full support!
That is my first point.
This has to be said quite plainly here.
I hope we will endorse it.
That has to be changed.
Here too there is room for improvement.
It is not!
I really would ask this quite urgently!
We have very little time.
VOTES
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That would save time.
That would save us work here.
That was very clear.

Mr President, on a point of order.
I may have missed something.
That did not happen on this occasion.
I understand the point you make.
That really is true.
It makes us look ridiculous.
If we want to do so, we can.
Mr Johannes Swoboda agreed with me.
It was a very big, stupid mistake.
That is the way things go.
(Loud applause) .
Mr President, on a point of order.
Crampton report (A4-149/97)
This is not true.


Titley report (A4-76/97)
We cannot support points 41 and 43.
The very opposite is the case!

Cohn-Bendit report (A4-127/97)
Bar√≤n Crespo report (A4-133/97)
So we cannot vote for this report.
Resolution on bananas
However, a lot remains to be done.
Resolution on Zaire
We know what happened next.
Soulier report (A4-131/97)
But there is no prospect of success.
The people do not want it' .
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Now that is all old hat.
Well, where do we actually stand now?
Correct!
Anyway, it is too late now to find out.
Congress made fun of Europe.
We do not like the Helms-Burton Act.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Mr President, will they listen?
No, far from it!
I doubt it!
This cannot be tolerated.
Europe should serve as a model!
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
That was in June 1995.
Indonesia:
That is the bright side of the story.
Where is the coherence in this?
Vietnam:
This is an intolerable situation.
That must change and change quickly.
This must be followed up in practice.
Isik Yurt√ßa:
This did not happen.
I was in Turkey early last week.
Famine in North Korea:
Here we do nothing!
And we spend ECU 75 million on that!
We have a reserve of ECU 10 million.
Action must be taken and urgently.
I think it is outrageous.
I totally reject that!
It is quite impudent!
They would have filled a whole book.
You can indeed force changes.
It would seem to be a useful idea.
Kenya:
This was not an isolated incident.
That aspect must also be borne in mind.
And finally Kenya.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Unity?
A truly ridiculous situation.
That is highly regrettable.
Only one meeting took place in 1996.
We cannot repeat that often enough.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
VOTES
You have the floor, Mr Papoutsis.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I give the floor to Mr Falconer.
That is scandalous.
Some form of subsidy will be needed.
Horizontal measures are also important.
Community energy objectives
It all fits together.
As they stand they are contradictory.
We come now to the crucial point.
That is the crucial point.
What are you saying?
Reference is made to imposing taxes.
More than those on petrol.
This amendment is acceptable.
The debate is closed.
The debate is closed.
Social legislation on road transport
And what do we have here?
Now what has the Commission done?
They are not doing anything.
They are not producing any figures.
They are not producing anything.
The Commission has done nothing.
The industry is a big one.
Thank you, Commissioner.
When oh when are we going...
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.02 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
In fact we still have the same date.
(General commotion)
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut the speaker off )
I had nothing to do with the motion.
I did not sign it.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(Parliament approved the Minutes.)
Votes
My button is clearly not working.
Schlechter report (A4-106/97)
Distance ceases to be a factor.
Of course, we cannot stop there.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
I am sorry...
I am not doing the translation.
Otherwise we cannot do this.
Mr Cars, you are undoubtedly right.
Nothing appears in the Minutes!
Here we all have a lot to learn.
This is the truth about this aid.
This must be made more efficient.
Approve Mr Rack's report, Mr President.
I asked for that to be minuted.
Nations are still divided by borders.
I believe that is important.
It is their task to carry it out.
Cooperation is an important point.
These are opportunities for Europe.
I am very happy to support it.
I share this scepticism.
That is partly a financial question.

This presupposes a good control system.
Emotional barriers must be dismantled.
Thank you, Mr Monti.
We shall now proceed to the vote.

(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Integration policy for island regions


That is the case with island regions.
We are grateful to you.
I stress for example the tax aspect.
Keep it up!
It is an essential for survival.
Thank you, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
International Registration of Marks
Let us think only of Coca Cola.

Thank you, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
That too is a respectable organization.
Thank you, Mr Hallam.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting closed at 12.30 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
We have heard nothing.
Mr President, on a point of order.
What Rule do we use?
How is it done?
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
Are there any objections?
(Parliament agreed to this proposal)
Let me give you a few examples.

For some reason, it was not able to.
There were no problems then.
(Applause from the PSE Group)
I put this motion to the vote.
(Parliament approved the request)
Urgent political matters
Thank you very much, Mr Pinheiro.
You have the floor, Mr Robles Piquer.
But they did not manage.
It was not a campaign of conquer.
We are not overstating it.
Let us be quite clear about this.
What do you mean by restraint?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.


That is not enough.
It results from healthy parameters.
The debate is adjourned.
European Council of 23 May 1997
Thank you very much, Mr Patijn.
You have the floor, Mr Oreja.
I give the floor to Mrs Green.

So what is the reality?
Thank, Mr Brok.
I give the floor to Mr Azzolini.
These powers must be finely balanced.
First, codecision.
A great deal has been said about this.
Next, the qualified majority.
Finally, simplification.
(Applause from the Green Group)
What kind of Europe are we building?
We should celebrate that fact.

I wish you courage.
And that is not being done!
They have failed and are bound to fail.

This is a minimalist revision.
We very much regret this.
Probably not!
What will the results be?
Will they turn out well or badly?
This is no good.
That is no good.
That could be better.
Let me just run through a few of these.
Let me be quite frank about this.
Without it, I fear the worst.
Next, job creation.
Mr President, I shall stop there.
Thank you very much, Mr Oreja.
The debate is closed.
Why?

This is a very important job.
But the figure is unimportant.
We are perfectly aware of that.
Thank you, Mr de Silguy.
But they have not been accepted.
I hope I am wrong.
But I am afraid that I am right.
We are thinking about that.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
EU tax systems


Thank you, Mr Monti.
We do not think it is on.
The people expect this too.
But what do we see?


Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
That is still a long way off.
Look at public contracts, for example.
It is urgently needed.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Non-conventional medicines



We concluded that it has.
There is, of course, a reason for this.
Nevertheless, people do turn to them.
I am merely offering food for thought.
The user believes that a therapy helps.
Indeed, he is convinced of the fact.
But on what guarantees?
The report is vague on that point.
With a diploma?
A university diploma?
No.
But by whom?
Not at all.
What on earth is this?
But that amendment goes further.
Practitioners qualified by whom?
That really is going too far!
It is not worthy of you or of us.
How widely is it practised?
Our citizens are demanding rights.
(Applause from the left)
I am totally opposed to that.

That is an ultra-liberal attitude.
Obviously not.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Social aspects of housing
I ask every Member to support it.

Thank you, Mr Flynn.
The debate is closed.
This debate could not be more timely.
So far, so good.
What did the Council do?
I too would recognize that.
That is not what we want or need!
I trust that is crystal clear.
Thank you, Mr Kinnock.
The joint debate is closed.
But one thing remains the same.
Thank you, Mr Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.05 a.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Thank you!
We must ask, who do we represent?
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
We are quite happy with the proposal.
And what had they done?
Will you do so as soon as possible?
It relates to disability pensions.
It is also politically sensitive.
The debate is closed.
Firstly, concerning overcrowding.
That is one point.

What does Amendment No 10 say?
All of us here are frequent travellers.
There is no list of passengers.
They need to know everyone on board!
Some companies do not object.
My sincere thanks to them.
They were very revealing.
VOTES
I would ask Parliament to approve them.
Amendment No 19
I wanted to vote against.
Please correct my vote.
No, Mr Provan.
(Parliament adopted the proposal)
(Parliament adopted the proposal)
Before the final vote
It ran out of time then.
(Parliament adopted the proposal)
Amendment No 12
(Parliament adopted the proposal)
the Christodoulou report (A4-0181/97)
I do not think so.
Monetary union is vital but not enough.
the Watts report (A4-0152/97)
the Parodi report (A4-0174)
We owe nothing less to our citizens.
the Schulz report (A4-0060/97)


the Secchi report (A4-0169/97)
the Harrison report (A4-0160/97)
(The President cut off the speaker)
the Lannoye report (A4-0075/97)
What is needed now is action.
the Crowley report (A4-0088/97)
That concludes the votes.
Adjournment of the session
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
I returned to the matter on Thursday.
Thank you, Mr Macartney.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
(The President cut the speaker off)
The trip was arranged for early May.
Why do I raise the matter?
Effectively you are sidelining us.
Order of business
No amendments have been proposed.
I give the floor to Mrs Green.
Let us take one part at a time.
Postponement of McIntosh report
You see the pressure we are under!
We will try to do it.
We will know by Wednesday morning.
I agree, that is what I said.
That is very tough going!
After all this House is sovereign.
The whole issue is important.
My Group has 214 members.
Agricultural debate
It seems quite clear.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
Mr President, I must object.
Mrs Lulling, you have the floor.
Is that not possible?
In other words, not your report.
Petitions 1996-1997
They are all doing important work.
Sadly my report is not all plaudits.
We are not the Supreme Court.
Let me give you an example.
Who do I have in mind?
Have they honoured that?
Certainly not!
That is case one.
This was sold when he was not looking.
He only owed them a very small loan.
I feel slightly ashamed about that.


Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Television broadcasting
We could do nothing by means of quotas.
Free trade must be about reciprocity.
We must create in order to compete.
Sports rights are key.
TV is Europe's Hollywood.

Mr Oreja could not be bothered to come.
Then we can say that we have won.
But is that really a victory?
But who are they poking fun at?!
The quotas battle is vital.
We cannot accept that situation.
Which will be seen and which not?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Health monitoring
We shall watch and wait.

The debate is closed.
Noise policy
That is what we want.
Congratulations to Mrs D√≠ez de Rivera.
Therefore we must do something.
But there are certain European aspects.
Legislation is insufficient, still.
Research must be encouraged.
Take Ostend airport in my own country.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.00 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
This invitation is a point of order.
We raised it again yesterday.
It concerns the Minutes, Mr President.
It is also useful to raise your hand.
... in answer to an earlier question.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
We have asked for intervention.
Decision on urgency
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
Mr President, excuse my lateness.
We shall check that out.
I am going to be relatively brief.
Our report is in two parts.
The news in this area is good.
That too is good news.
What are the concerns?
The main concern is unemployment.
We need to be very nuanced here.
My concern is of another nature.
That is now the past.
It is a practical achievement.
That covers the technical side.
Then the currency can work!
But that has now happened.
That is what we are aiming for.
Why?
You could do that today for us.
That is where we now stand.
I think it is time to take a grip.


This needs to be resolved urgently.
We tried that.
It failed.
We do not need that either.
Those are political aims.
Confidence in EMU is waning by the day.

Transitional, but until when?

Next, tax harmonization.

How should it be implemented?
However, we must go further.
For us there is no contradiction.
I believe that is not necessary.
It is part of the aims of EMU.
First of all, the instruments.
You also need a framework.
There is no reason to limit its scope.
Now it has to be put into practice.
I now come to VAT.
Yes, I will.
That has to be made quite clear.
What can it do to help employment?
We have to realise that.
(Loud applause)
The debate is closed.
VOTES
It was simply forgotten.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
So the word 'new' is not in the text.
But the majority voted against it.
I have no idea why.
You need not worry.
Before the final vote
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Our Parliament took a wise decision.
That is a bad omen for things to come.
We have therefore abstained.
Perry report (A4-0190/97)
That is to be regretted.
It is a public health problem.
We are ready to discuss that!
Mezzaroma report (A4-0194/97)
This leads us to a paradox.
The benefits of EMU are obvious.
Ettl report (A4-0185/97)
Four√ßans report (A4-0192/97)
Let us explain ourselves.

I do not think so.
We are in a Catch-22 situation.
Randzio Plath report (A4-0164/97)
That is the end of voting time.
Telecommunications and ONP
This is a very crucial phrase.
The debate is closed.
Production and marketing of honey
And that can be very painful!

Let me explain them to you briefly.
You have the text there after all.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The debate is closed.
Summer-time
We have reached that goal.
The debate is closed.
Combined goods transport
Again I agree with the rapporteur.
PACT II runs from 1997 to 2001.
I can also agree to Amendment No 7.
The debate is closed.
Tourism
There has been silence.
Silence from the Commission.
They will never do it!
They have been a grave disappointment.
Tourism however has been abandoned.
Secondly, Philoxenia.
Thirdly, tourism and the Euro.
Tourism means jobs.
The two are not compatible.
The Commissioner must push for that.
We shall back you, Commissioner.
Can we count on your attendance?
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow.
Question Time (Commission)
But the two things are not linked.
Please tell me about them.
Subject: Abolition of duty-free sales
The UK also has a problem.
We fully acknowledge that.
I am very glad of it.
Mr Cassidy, you have one minute.
In other words, nearly ECU 20.
It has no place in a single market.
Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.
Mr Andersson, on a point of order.
These are repeated acts of violence.
I thought your last answer was evasive.
Subject: Regional policy/islands
The opinion mentions 'island regions' .
I would like her to clarify that.
Mr McMahon, on a point of order.
Do you agree?
Why?
That is a fact.
Unfortunately, that is the case.
We want to have young people also.
We cannot forget total generations.
Subject: Drift nets
Subject: Task force on future of CFP
You can use other tools.
This I cannot predict.
Mr Morris, listen for one moment.
I wish to be helpful.
I think Mrs Bonino wants to reply.
That is the important point.
I go along with your interpretation.
That is swift work for the Commission!
We deliberately avoided that.
It can, however, be resolved.
I therefore fully agree.
Where will it lead us?
It is, as I have said, a lively one.
First of all, Mr Hern√°ndez Mollar.
That is a difficult technical issue.
That is another technical system.
Do you follow me?
It shows how important it is.
That is budgetary-neutral.
That money must be found somewhere.
There are a number of possibilities.
It has been a good balancing measure.
It has stopped over-production.
I am a rapporteur too.
Quotas are a rigid instrument.
As you know, it is very modest.
Of course, you were well of that.
I hope that we are going to succeed.
I now come to Mr Sturdy's report.
The packet is minuscule.
I shall begin with the packet.
I now move on to the package.
In my view that was not very wise.
I agree with the Commissioner.
That was the case six months ago.
But the arguments have changed.
And socially unsound.
But you don't make it easy for us.
So you are making it difficult for us.
The same applies to set-aside.
That is what shocks me.
What about producing better?
Real fallow land is not unproductive.
What has been left?
That has nothing to do with Europe.
First, the Funk report.
An example is tobacco production.
That is one of my points.
No one seems to be addressing that.
Do not let things come to that.
But is this fair?
This has got to change.
Many thanks to the rapporteurs.
This change is also welcome.
He has taken a great deal of trouble.
Not all of us can support this policy.
The Sturdy report raises these issues.
Let us hope we can.
The money has to be found somewhere.
We do not conjure it out of mid-air.
I agree with you.
Mr Fantuzzi made that point.
We try to live in the real world.
Why?
That brings me to my second point.
Then you'll find we're on your side!
There is general agreement on this.
I think this is worthwhile.
We did not.
I agree with Mr Kofoed.
The debate is closed.
Novel foods
It has created a confusing situation.
You can't have this both ways.
Is it up to manufacturers?
It is involved in the second reading.
You referred to a directive.
But that goes without saying!
You know me.
If I make a mistake, I accept it.
Because that is the real problem!
The joint debate is closed.
The sitting closed at 00.20 a.m.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Is the House sovereign or not?
But you referred to Mr Ford.
Mr Ford, you are a provocateur!
(Mixed reactions)
(The Minutes were adopted)
The time has come to conclude.
First of all concerning CFSP proper.
I shall oppose that.
It is the fruit of a lengthy labour.
But this is urgent.
That growth must still be rich in jobs.
All the Member States wanted that.
Let us not miss the opportunity.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Santer.
You have the floor, Mrs Green.
What is our position?
We did not succeed.
That at least is our position.
I now come to the IGC.
What needs to be improved?
But how can it be put into practice?
That was in 1787.
They want to help the cook.
The President-in-Office confirmed that.
We need a growth and stability pact.
First of all, the third pillar.
Sadly I found none.
But the IGC must restore the balances.
What does this mean?
Several points.
Secondly.
Thirdly: democratization.
I give three examples.
Second example: public service.
It will certainly be useful.
I would like to underline two points.
They are a challenge to us all.
Some things have been achieved.
Some things remain to be done.
Let us all rise to this challenge!
I simply cannot accept that.
I now give the floor to Mr Bourlanges.
That is how it is.
First, the stability pact.
This is a question we can talk about.
The Euro-icon will be removed.
A change there would be most welcome.
Those gains must be held on to.
I also know what your agenda is.
But it is not really necessary.
I therefore propose stopping here.
Thank you very much, Mr van Mierlo.
You have well interpreted our interest.
I give the floor to Mr Santer.
Job creation is our first priority.
Thank you very much, Mr Santer.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
VOTES
I think that is pure common sense.
Mr President, there was confusion.
I do not think we need another vote.
On amendment No 50
(Loud Applause )
That is not a problem for us.
We are very happy with that position.
So, with Labour you can take your pick.
Good.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
We have certainly not ruled it out.'
Read report (A4-0171/97)
European Council
For a Swede this is unacceptable!
Draft Treaty
They are not in the know.

Europe is at a crossroads.
Progress in CFSP 1996
Let us be realistic!
That is absolutely right.
It is not just a game for diplomats.
I found it excellent.
We support this approach.
Various reasons are suggested for this.
Let us not miss this opportunity.
That is not true.
In other areas, our attitudes differ.
No comment.
This should be remembered.
We respect these solutions.
Cyprus is a case in point.
I think this is excellent.
Even the sun sometimes has its spots.
And so has this report in some places.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
EP-national parliaments relations
That is up to them.
That issue must be tackled by this IGC.
Why?
I fully approve this point of view.
The debate is closed.
So these texts remain a dead letter.

I support your position.
Both speakers also emphasized that.
Rome was not built in a day.
Do you want a guarantee?
So who is to blame, you ask?
Is that serious?
We need to get a change in procedures.
The basic problem is serious fraud.
What is the reason for it?
Soon the loopholes also become obvious.
Of course, we only have a text.
Then we have a convention.
I agree.
We ourselves do not know.
Everyone has said so.
This is what I wanted to say.
Thank you very much, Minister.
The debate is closed.
Question time (Council)
Questions to the Council.
Subject: EU policy towards China
Subject: EU policy on China
Is there a policy to cover this?
It is an interesting question.
Please answer that question.
What impact is it going to have?
Do you have studies?
Have you conducted them?
I know that this is not convenient.
We know where the powers lie.
It is nothing new for this to happen.
I do not think this is good enough.
I hope not.
There is a little confusion here.
That does not deal with the issue.
We know why it happens.
That is surely not the answer.
Subject: Mines
Subject: EU ban on anti-personnel mines
Subject: Landmines
It is in three parts, as follows.
That is how desperately serious it is.
How can the Council explain this?
I shall be brief for the interpreters.
Subject: The EU banana regime
That is my opinion.
I am very interested in what you say.
I have no other news.
Let us turn to the decision.
My response is the following.
Armed insurrection has been the result.
Will this situation be repeated?
Now we have the results to hand.
China-Europe relations
I could go on.
That is doubly valid here.
We congratulate him on it.
My first amendment aims to do this.
We must continue in this vein.
A great deal depends on us.
From the Dalai Lama?
From God?
I have no idea.
Thirdly, he speaks about Hong Kong.
Hong Kong has changed sovereignty.
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is our objective.
Now how do we achieve it?
People talk about consistency.
That is not enough either.
We have to work actively for that.
We should not hesitate to do that.
Hong Kong is important.
Thank you, Sir Leon.
The debate is closed.
Baltic initiative
This risk must be eliminated.
The role of Russia is also important.
More binding provisions are needed.
This alone must be the deciding factor.
I congratulate him on it.
I hope my amendments will be adopted.
I agree with that.
Thank you, Sir Leon.
The debate is closed.
Equal pay for women and men
We still have a long way to go.
Why is this?
Remember the examples I have given you.
It is a good report.
Surely that cannot be too much to ask!
That is the case of Sweden.
Reality is something very different.
Much more is needed alongside it.
Many changes are needed.
The labour market needs to change.
Anything else would be disreputable.
It could not be simpler.
That is Mr Blak's point.
The code is ambitious.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
In other words they must show the way.
At European and national levels.
We should copy that too.
This is the lives of our citizens.
Well done, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel.
Why?
We live in interesting times.
That is my speech.
That concludes my second speech.
I will dwell on just two points.
I will try to explain that better.
What will happen then?
We insist very much on this point.
The Commission shares this view point.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Research and sustainable development
Our debate will and must continue.
And it is a radical one.
Mr Marset Campos does that.
Those are not in as an afterthought.
They were deliberately included.
But it is not doom-laden.
He highlights many actions.
Technical fixes are not enough.
It is not enough to develop technology.
Thank you too, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The agreement sets a time of 5 minutes.
The Council never re-submitted it.
It is now time to mention the WTO.
But I remain available for such talks.



You have won.
Do you believe in resurrection?
I regard it as an insult.
We must reject them as they stand.
That need not be the case.
Let us challenge them strongly.
That is wholly and totally unrealistic.
We have nothing to be ashamed of.
You read out your written speech.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 00.25 a.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?

Please could it be added.
We will make sure that is corrected.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
We have dealt with the issue.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I totally support what Mr McMahon said.
Sir Leon Brittan was here last night.
That means better tailored information.
We agree entirely.
It is still too vague.
This should lead to a real openness.
What is Kennedy remembered for?
Young people are the future of Europe.
Why do I say this?
We have to be attentive.
We shall do all we can to help them.
This is just the beginning.
The debate is closed.
SOCRATES' action programme
But now we are left with no money.
It will not suffice!
Socrates has been a great success.
This is a very dangerous thing to do.
No, that is unthinkable!
That, unfortunately, is not the case.
That is unacceptable.
Please, ladies and gentlemen, be quiet.
Thank you.
I can only welcome that support.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
We now proceed to the vote.
VOTES
We have a lot of votes to get through.

I request your consent.
Does anyone oppose that?
(Parliament rejected the request)
(Applause)
So that is a technical matter.
That is our oral amendment.
No.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Nothing was done.
Funk report (A4-0176/97)
Sturdy report on prices package).
Baldarelli report (A4-0189/97)
That is why we support it.

Pack report (A4-0188/97)
Stockmann report (A4-0130/97)
Apiculture is an important business.
No!
Spencer report (A4-0193/97)
Yet that system does not work.
Nothing is more legitimate than that.
We do not want this.
Neyts-Uyttebroeck report (A4-0179/97)
These questions are not theoretical.
And that is all.
That is not our opinion.
But there are alternative solutions.
McMillan-Scott report (A4-0198/97)
Burenstam Linder report (A4-0196/97)
This is a good report.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
This type of dumping is inadmissible.
There are far more deep seated reasons.
I am convinced that we shall succeed.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Thousands have died.
What has Europe done?
Abolition of the death penalty

Colombia
It must at least take steps to do so.
That is certainly having an effect.
That is very important.
We are realists.
Before all else, that has to change!
Street children in Moscow
But that is the only new development.
Indonesia and East Timor
This is intolerable!
That is not all.
Belarus
Our future credibility depends on it.
Well done!
The debate is closed.
Voting will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The spectre of 1993 is hovering.
This must stop.
That is the meaning of my amendment.


The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
I only have two comments to make.
We support the resolution.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Mr President, on a point of order.
These errors can happen.

Marset Campos report (A4-0170/97)
Pimenta report (A4-0187/97)
3) And now the factual errors.
EU role in sport
It over-arches sports legislation.
Has it gone to sleep?
We fully endorse this request.
Let us be quite clear about this.
What do we want?
We actually want two things.
Sport is an international language.
Sport binds people together!
But they can participate in sport.
First of all, the sport model.
The debate is closed.
Excise duty on certain mineral oils
I agree with that in principle.
That is an urgent task.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.05 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
I did vote on every vote yesterday.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
That was perfectly clear.
Thank you Mrs Aelvoet .
Votes
Cox report (A4-206/97)

Pack report (A4-197/97)
Such a force should be left in peace.
This trend must be reversed.
Thank you very much.
We shall look into it.
Thank you very much.
We shall look into it.
Madam President, on a point of order.
Do you agree?
What were we voting on?
Thank you very much.
I have already explained this before.
That was what Members wanted.
Thank you, Mr Nassauer.
Consequently, I am leaving the Chamber.
(Mixed reactions) )
(Applause)
Article 366a of Lom√© IV


We really must overcome this problem.
Member of the Commission.
Thank you very much, Mrs Gradin.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution.)
Marine biotoxins
Naturally those involved were appalled.
The Torry Institute is a very good one.
It was also a victim of privatization.
I think that goes without saying.
It raises a very important issue.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mandate of Advisers on Biotechnology
I apologize to Mrs Gradin.
On the contrary!
Mrs Gradin, thank you for your reply.
I just wanted to add that point.
And do we then kill that human being?
That is the ethical dilemma.
We have to face it.
The debate is closed.
We now proceed to the vote.
Europe Agreement with Bulgaria
Allow me to make a comment here.
I forgot to mention it.
It is not yet included in my report.
Please excuse me.
I hope you will forgive us.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Norwegian salmon dumping
Alan Macartney deserves our thanks too.
Well they would be would not they?
I hope that is true.
That was the alternative.
The debate is closed.
Adjournment of the session
Thank you all for your cooperation.
(The sitting was closed at 11.38 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
That did not happen either.
Thank you very much, Mr Schwaiger.
(The Minutes were approved)
Welcome
Urgent political matters
I call upon Mr Commissioner de Silguy.
First, the euro.
The euro is here to stay.
Secondly, the economic situation.
This ageing is significant.
Is this not extremely unwise?
Let me reassure Mr Provan.
Do you wish to reply, Mr Commissioner?
Thank you for that question, Mr Fayot.
That is a very good question.
We are already giving thought to that.
So that will simplify the situation.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Takeover bids
Was legislation necessary or not?
This has not been done.
This is not the case in Article 10.
This directive is very much reduced.
This proposal is the wrong proposal.
This proposal is the wrong proposal.
The debate is closed.
Dangerous preparations
This is progress.
Pesticides are included as well.
This really is essential.
This is the purpose of Amendment 40.
So I assume all this can be sorted out.
The debate is closed.
1998 estimate for EP and Ombudsman
That is what we are establishing today.
It has not been able to do so.
But it cannot take beyond September.
I now turn to the report itself.
We have clearly incorporated that.
It does not depend on future votes.
It is in this draft report.
The landlord needed to be paid.
I commend the report to the House.
That is the least that can be expected.
That must be the goal of our activity.
This is a very strange proposal.
Parties are created by the people.
Let me refer you to paragraph 36.
I understand such comments.
That needs to be said very clearly!
My thanks to Mr Tomlinson.
I therefore support Amendment 17.
I do not see any need for subsidies.
A proper audit is called for.
The debate is closed.
The information society

Information will be the raw material.
On paper everything is in place.
This is where we must start.
Four basic questions arise here.
Young people are the future of the EU.
There is plenty to do.
That is a very important step.
We need more transparency in this area.
I can only share her view.
That is the main issue.
Why?
All well and good.
But in the meantime, what happens?
That is the end product.
Because what does the Commission do?
We do not expect this.
Nor should we be too didactic.
I think that is overdue.
There are two other aspects I welcome.
That is indeed sensible.
We do not have harmonized markets.
So what do we need?
First we need more R&D resources.
And we need broad consensus on that.
So I will now say it in German.
You were very defensive today.
That is the reason for our reaction.
We would like them to be integrated.
I never said that you do no work!
(The President cut off the speaker)
The debate is closed.
Imports of hormone-treated meat
The same applies to lawyers.
That is because they are banned!
Why should we use hormones?
To be competitive?
How are the judges chosen?
No-one knew anything about bananas.
The customer is still king.
They want to continue this trend.
We do not want the stuff!
We do not need it!
We have to resist that.
Why?
The answer is simple: profit.
Hormones are dangerous.
We fought against DES.
It will not look good for us.
The debate is closed.
Cohesion Fund - Structural Funds
The picture for 1997 looks different.
We hope it will confirm this.
We now only have to await the results.
It is not even a national problem.
They are very interesting at times.
There were some not so good examples.
A further finding relates to planning.
Thank you, Mrs Wulf-Mathies.
The debate is closed.
Agreement with the Kyrgyz Republic
The debate is closed.
PHARE programme
How can this be improved?
We all have our own experiences.
To that I can give my support.
This report could not be more clear.
The banks are ready for this.
I consider that unacceptable.
I would ask you to take note of that.
I can only agree with him entirely.
No concrete targets are set out.
(Mrs Wulf-Mathies confirmed this.)
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)
Mr President, I have a point of order.
Thank you, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel.
Welcome
A special thank you.
That is the great thing.
It is accompanied by two resolutions.
The net result here is positive.
That is a very good thing.
Next, a word about subsidiarity.
That will not come easily.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Santer.
I call upon Mrs Green.
We wasted a great deal of time.
Mrs Thatcher used to do this.
Who is defending Europe's interests?
(Applause)
Those should now be our objectives.

Well, the failings are obvious.
The vote will take place at noon.
I call upon Mr H√§nsch.
I must warn against that!
(Applause)
I do not have much more to say now.
We have a duty to be demanding.
Why?
That too is worth noting.
Does this mean the end for Europe?
Not in the least.
What will you decide in the autumn?
That would be strange and unbelievable!
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega.
It is not as easy as that.
Next, vote weighting.
Others wanted the exact opposite.
There was no retreat on any point.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately.
Votes
: rejected
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, you are absolutely right.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Which is why we feel as we do.
The mission is unaccomplished.
Frankly, I have my doubts.
The improvements are numerous.
It includes many other things as well.
This we support.
Nor can we support points 8 and 12.
We lose our sovereignty as electorates.
There are kind words on employment.
This has not happened.
However I am not fully happy about it.
Myopia ruled the day.
Fontaine report (A4-0204/97)
Tomlinson report (A4-0178/97)


Hendrick report (A4-0163/97)
Boogerd-Quaak (A4-0208/97)
We are waiting for it!
Ahlqvist report (A4-0200/97)
The greatest danger to be avoided.
Chesa report (A4-0032/97)
Hormone treated meat

Novo Belenguer report (A4-0210/97)
That was why I voted for it.
I share that opinion.
The assent procedure remains in place.
That concludes Voting Time.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 1.20 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
I find that scandalous.

(The Minutes were approved)
We shall now hear from Mr Gallagher.
Mr Titley would like to speak.
Membership of Parliament
Order of business
Mr Blot, you may now speak.
Thank you.
Thursday:

There is no link between the two.
(Parliament rejects the request)
That is correct.
Thank you, Mr Guti√©rrez D√≠az.
Mr Posselt would like to speak.
Thank you, Mr Posselt.
Thank you, Mr S√∂derman.
However, there are information centres.
That is very important.
I read them both with great interest.
I welcome this initiative as well.
The debate is closed.
Let me briefly give you the facts.
On the contrary.
How are we to tackle that?
It is no different from that.
Senegal presents another problem.
What is the procedure?
The challenge begins here.
We will miss you.
Congratulations, Nicole!
This is a good agreement.
I was not being contentious.
I was merely stating a fact.
There has been a misunderstanding.
New Member States can come in.
This is the normal procedure.
But the procedure operates in this way.
Thank you very much, Mrs Bonino.
The debate is closed.
The resolution forms a triptych.
We have to stress both aspects.
No!
It all depends how you look at it.
Are these national laws the culprits?
This is also underlined in the report.
Thank you very much, Mrs Gradin.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.05 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Thank you very much, Mr Samland.
Are there any other comments?
I would like that corrected.
Thank you very much, Mrs Ahern.
That has been noted.
(The Minutes were approved)
Decision on urgency
(The request was approved)
That is all.
That is why we need this Directive.
That, of course, is untrue.
That, of course, is untrue.
That, of course, is untrue.
That, of course, is untrue.
Enough of this nonsense!
It cannot be done by patent law alone.
That is all.
We need it urgently.
That is why I ask for your support.
(Applause)
The committee will have a free vote.
My third and final observation.
I am asking you to respect ours too.
How are we to take a view on this?
That is all it says!
That is the aim of the directive.
I believe that reflection is in order.
It is about human rights.
That, I hear you say, was yesterday.
One or two questions come to mind.
It is really quite a fundamental point.
Have we gone far enough?
And that is the danger today.
The wording is new, the content old.
That would be wrong.
That is why we tabled them.
We need legal consistency.
This is removed by the draft directive.

Is that actually true?
I have two reactions to this.
Est modus in rebus , as Horace put it!
There are other ethical standards.
Nor do we have to succumb to slogans.
That will violate human dignity.
Is our life an invention?
Why?
Why am I doing this?
That is what we reject!
It is fair to the patients groups.
I have here a file of misinformation.
That is absolute nonsense.
The United States has 1, 300.
There is!
This is not about defending the sick!
And so we are opposed to this.
This is, of course, wrong!
How do we face that dilemma?
That was the clear reasoning behind it.
A patent entails a kind of monopoly.
This report was passed unanimously.
Allow me to highlight a few.
However, it does not stop there.
That is a sine qua non of progress.
What then is the central question?
Thank you, Commissioner.
It really does work!
The debate is closed.
Biotechnology and the White Paper
Let me make that clear.
Thank you, Commissioner Bjerregaard.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
(Loud applause)
You may count on my complete loyalty.
Thank you so much.
VOTES
Madam President, on a point of order.
I refer to Rule 53(5).
Madam President, on a point of order.
What Mr Macartney said is correct.
They were not put before the committee.
That is the essence of this matter.
On the Souchet report (A4-0144/92)
On the Pery report (A4-0220/97)
It is a grotesque situation.
On the Gallagher report (A4-0229/97)
On the Papakyriazis report (A4-0211/97)
On the Larive report (A4-0219/97)
On the Bowe report (A4-0239/97)
That brings the voting to a close
Telecommunications and competition
This needs further study.
The point was accepted.
That point too was accepted.
What problems am I talking about?
That is not the case everywhere.
This point has not yet been resolved.
That is a major problem.




(The President cut off the speaker)
I have a question for the Commission.
Competition is completely open.
We lead the world as Internet users.
Thank you, I am expecting a lot of you.
Which brings me to what Mrs Read said.
We shall take it from there.
We shall not be the dog in the manger.
They are going to have to be reduced.
I am just finishing.
My statement is clear.
Commissioner, please send it to us too.
The subject is of great interest to us.
The debate is closed.
Maximum speed of tractors
The debate is closed.
We all know why.
Our Group had opposed this.
There is no question about that.
That must not be forgotten.
This is unfair.
We farmers cannot accept that.
This is disappointing.
The Commission recognizes that.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Does the Commissioner agree?
Who will decide?
Who will arbitrate?
But that cannot be imposed.
I, therefore, refer to joint ventures.
We know where it is.
We are just at the beginning.
I hope not.
Subject: The Kenyan elections
Why?
The Commissioner needs to address that.
I will just mention a few.
Each case of demobiliziation is unique.
This is something which is totally new.
Has such information been received?
However, you may answer if you wish.
I believe I ought to be fair here.
I hope you will understand.
Subject: Capital Region network
I thank you, Commissioner Monti.
We will take all the necessary action.
Road passenger transport
The next item is the joint debate on:
I welcome these measures.
I apologise very much for that.
I hope he will forgive me.
I am sure he does.
You have the floor.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Charging of HGV

My second point concerns Annex III.
That is a dishonest approach!
Aviation safety improvement
We cannot afford to be complacent.
I personally have reservations.
We must have controlled liberalization.
It must affect safety!
This could be done at once.
There must be no more Lockerbies.
That is unacceptable.
That is completely unacceptable.
Secondly, safety near airports.
I think that is urgently needed.
That is one point.
A long-distance driver may not do that.
That is particularly worrying.
It is pollution at airports.
So liberalization means many things.
I will not repeat them.
I should be most grateful if he could.
Yes, Madam President, as is my custom.
Thank you, Mr Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
I am also opposed to that.
For example, they must be honest.
I applaud that.
They must pass a written test.
I welcome this section.
Thank you , Mr Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.35 p.m.)
Welcome
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
I contend that this is a mistake.
Your remarks are noted.
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, you may now speak.

(Mixed reactions)
Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, you are a lawyer.
This is contrary to the rules.
That is my first point of order.
That settles the matter.
Topical and urgent debate (objections)
It is not a rule.
(Mixed reactions) It is not a Rule.
I put the objection to the vote.
(Parliament approved the objection)
So you are both right and wrong.
(Mixed reactions)
Agenda 2000
We already know that it is not enough.
In this area, no risks can be taken.
How can that be, you ask?
Those are the figures.
We have now laid the stepping-stones.
(Sustained applause)
President Santer has referred to that.
Allow me a few words on Cyprus.
That is very right and proper.
We want to export stability.
What will the cost of enlargement be?
We can all see the need for this.
Never mind that.
This balance must be found.
Let us beware of this trap.
Well and good.
We shall see what it can do.
There was not response at the time.
I congratulate you.
(Loud applause)
Thank you very much.
What part will Turkey be playing?
We do need answers here!
(Applause)
My final comment is on Turkey.
It would quite simply be unacceptable.
I think the answer is no.
There is a lot to be said about that.
That is the reality.
Who can seriously agree with that?!
So what is this policy?
None other than the cohesion policy.
Why 45, 000 and not 90, 000 or 35, 000?
This project has been ill prepared.
It is indeed a historic opportunity.
That is wrong!
That is how we have presented things.
This opportunity has to be seized.
Enlargement must then succeed.
Financing of the CFSP
You did not give me the floor.
We shall vote against it.
What contempt for democracy!
(Applause from the I-EDN Group)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately.
VOTES

Those are the reasons for my request.
(Parliament rejected the request)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Why so much haste?
Why so many anomalies?
What budget rights do we have left?
Rothley report (A4-0222/97)
I am disappointed with the outcome.


But those are sophisms.
It has not been an easy decision.
The existing patent laws are adequate.
There are many grey areas.
So what is the conclusion?
Congratulations.
Programme of the Luxembourg presidency
They are now part of our culture.
This work will be carried out actively.
EMU is technically on track.
Its costs in human terms are huge.









Merci!
That task has not been accomplished.
But today I am optimistic.
I wish you well.
Gudde m√´tteg, H√§r Pr√§sident!
They want practical and real solutions.
We cannot and must not disappoint them!
I would take a different attitude.
Firstly, it must be very practical.
Thank you for your answer, Mr Poos.
The debate is closed.
Situation in Turkey and Northern Iraq
It is the same old story about Turkey.
That is the official number.
Goodness knows how many it really is.
What is the response from Turkey?
What absolute hypocrisy!
We want open doors, not more walls.
Turkey is a part of European history.
That is very important.
That option it must have.
Let us make no mistake.
There is no ambiguity on this.
That was the expression that they used.
Thank you very much, Mr Wohlfahrt.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Mr Wohlfart.
That is the right approach.
Nothing has stabilized in Albania.
The new authority is not yet in place.
The army is practically non-existent.
The population is still over-armed.
I should express two wishes.
We must improve our methods.
Thank you Mrs Lalumi√®re.
Mr Parigi will now speak.
Let us have no more of that!
This is something we must all respect.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
I shall therefore echo that answer.
Subject: Situation in Algeria
Subject: Burma
Subject: Road safety measures
I hope so, Madam, as soon as possible.
That is the only answer I can give you.
That was the first question.
Subject: Trade cooperation with Mexico
First of all, concerning the substance.
Subject: Demise of democracy in Belarus
We must do something concrete.
This has already been done.
We know what it is like for the people.
Subject: Abolition of duty-free
Fiscal frontiers remain in place.
It will be more expensive to travel.
Would he please answer the question?
What is the logic of that?
I am not sure that it will do so.
We have the facts.
Subject: Sri Lanka massacre
Agenda
What has happened to the money?
The debate is closed.
Ariane
We should celebrate and sing for this.
The Bureau congratulates Mrs Mouskouri.
The debate is closed.
That really is a very long title.
The debate is closed.
Towards sustainability
That is fine.
But they have one thing in common.
Lifestyles cannot be changed overnight.
Not 'one size fits all' , here.
The proposal is unrealistic.
The debate is closed.
What unparalleled arrogance!
Meaning what, precisely?
Let us take it to heart.
That would help.
You ticked the wrong box, didn't you?
Go on, you really want it.
But the proposal has been presented.
These are not minor textual ones.
That is not the case here.
The debate is closed.
Environmental agreements
I shall now say why I believe that.
Regional problems can be solved.
Agreements can play a role here.
I don't think so!
That must not happen.
That was my question.
We have simply not examined the matter.
The debate is closed.
UNGASS Planet Earth summit
So, where does it leave us?
It is all still there on the agenda.
That is what matters.
Personally, I think not.
How are we to proceed?
Just look at what has happened.
There have been no successes.
(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)
Approval of the minutes
Are there any comments?
(The minutes were approved)
Waiver of parliamentary immunity
MED programmes
We cannot prosecute anyone.
Mr Commissioner, you have six months.
Must it be right?
I support here views on the subject.
And what can be done now?
The Court of Auditors reported them.
How should the Commission do this?
It is good to see that it has not.
But what happened?
The debate is closed.

They are a moral example.
It is true!
Smokers have a pact with the devil.
It is good business right now.
That is why the COM must be remodelled.
However, it does not go far enough.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is something of a double standard!
We must now take the bull by the horns.
I share this view.
VOTES
Are there any objections?
The question is rather difficult.
That is very much open to question.
on the Mouskouri report (A4-0237/97)
on the Fontaine report (A4-0246/97)
We cannot fail to welcome this result.
on the Jarzembowski report (A4-0243/97)
But I still cannot support it.
on the Berger report (A4-0238/97)
on the Virgin report (A4-0241/97)
What are we to do with our wastes?
We therefore agree with it.
Topical and urgent debate
We were wrong.
So what are we to do?
I do not think so.
There are one or two positive signs.
And, of course, democracy is the loser.
What should happen next?
The question is, what can we do?
The joint debate is closed.
We must be very careful indeed.

I do not know whether it was or not.
The debate is closed.
Death sentence in the United States
Enough is enough.

The death penalty is irrevocable.
Kenya
These are now being examined.
Peru
Sexual mutilations in Egypt
Tunisia
There is in fact a paradox in Tunisia.
A lot of hard work will be needed.
It has not yet been ratified.
The period of time set is twelve years.
Once again, we need proof!
Who says anything about it?
I am quite dumbfounded.
The talks are currently stalled.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
So matters are in hand in that respect.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
For that reason we ask the Commission:
So what is to be done?
Resist that temptation.
Give us some extra.
Thank you, Sir Leon Brittan.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Votes (continuation)

They are unwittingly at risk as well.

On the Fabra Vall√©s report
Social dialogue
I congratulate him warmly.
In most cases they know better.
This cannot continue any longer.
However, this can be changed.
This is the route we should chose.
This is excellent.
This too has changed.
Good!
The social partners must open up.
Let me make two preliminary statements.
Amendment to the Financial Regulation
What does this mean?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Financial control of structural funds
What bases could we have?
Why was that?
We are not talking about sanctions.
And even the opposite of this is true.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

This should remain an exception.
Be that as it may, however.

It was not then in a position to do so.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
On Amendment No. 1
That is what was agreed.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
This seems a little excessive to me!
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Aid to hop producers is necessary.
I consider this unacceptable.
Thank you, Mr Posselt.
Green paper on competition policy
That is precisely the point.
These are national matters.
That is really what this is all about.
That is what we intend to do.
That is naturally impossible.
I think I have gone over my time.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Some questions still remain.
Essentially, there are three.
This cannot be stressed often enough.
The outcome is well known.
That must not happen!
We have kept our word.
It has not done so.
We are simply being fobbed off.
The wool is being pulled over our eyes!
We will not do so!
They should not be.
Thank you, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
The floor is yours, Mr Castagn√®de.
Two examples will illustrate my point.
It is also timid about the future.
Thank you, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Please go ahead, Mr Kittelmann.
Here too, clear progress has been made.
I can see none here.
Please go ahead.
That has our approval.
Thank you most sincerely.
Thank you, Mr van der Waal.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
And now we are in some difficulty.
You may go ahead, Mr Kittelmann.
Adjournment of the session
The session is adjourned.
(The sitting closed at 12.15 p.m.)
Resumption of the Session
Tribute
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Welcome
Order of Business
Monday:
So, we would ask that it comes forward.
(Parliament agreed to the request)
Tuesday:
What is the wrong with this subject?
Are people afraid of it, Mr President?
We should not be afraid of it.
We did not dismiss it out of hand.
I shall now put the request to a vote.
(Parliament rejected the request)
This is a very important issue.
(Parliament approved the request)
That has not been done.
Wednesday:
Mr President, I have a question.
Are there any other speakers in favour?
Thursday and Friday: no change.
Sittings of 1 and 2 October in Brussels
(No change)
Calendar of Part-Sessions 1998
(Parliament agreed to this deadline)
Advertising
Thank you very much, Mr Bangemann.
The debate is closed.
What a programme for so little money!
Files of requests are accumulating.
The chairman, Mr Pex has said so.
We therefore need to hurry up.
Have we done well?
The question can again be asked today.
There was none.
This conciliation has been a failure.
What will Raphael become?
The debate is closed.
Cohesion policy and culture

This share must be increased.
The report is positive too.
(The President cut off the speaker)
It mentions quality tourism.
At any rate, I do not share that view.
The debate is closed.
Postal Services
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
Slowly but surely is a German maxim.
And where can they acquire an income?
They fly in the face of all experience.
That is perfectly obvious.
The debate is closed.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
In fact, the date was 19 July.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Equal opportunities for men and women
But my question is: ' now what?'
Fortunately it did so in 1996.
We have said it all before.
That is the current debate.
And action is what is needed!
It will not implement itself.
So positive action indeed.
Point 14 calls for assessment.
I would make this more specific.
I am very concerned about this.
I am optimistic for the future.
The joint debate is closed.
Violence against women
But we now know that it is not.
We have discussed it several times.
This report is another cry for help.
I do not think that is the real answer.
A structural approach is necessary.
But we should make no mistake.
Governments have also played a part.
This is really serious.
Much more needs to be done.
It would have become them.
It is basically a human rights issue.
The situation has now changed.
It is an important report.
Obviously, the need is great.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12.00 noon.
Which one, the bottle?'.
I think the question is justified.
Women's rights are human rights.
This is a European matter.
This advertising cheapens all women.
We know of a recent victim.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12.00 noon.
VOTES
Paragraph 17
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Commission proposal on the wine market
I have voted for the report.
Scapagnini report (A4-0268/97)
Azzolini report (A4-0252/97)
Kokkola report (A4-0251/97)
Eriksson report (A4-0201/97)
Lenz report (A4-0258/97)
That completes voting time.
Draft budget for 1998
(Applause from the left)
So far so good.
That puts it in a nutshell.
That is incomprehensible.
The same goes for social actions.
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the left)
I shall certainly be here.
The debate is closed.
I repeat, disappointment is not enough.
But the time has come for negotiation.
Finally, Mr Commissioner, Somalia.
This decision is unacceptable.
This is not the position of our group.
That is true.
It is essential.
Parliament wants to help.
We want to play our part.
This arbitration outcome is essential.
Why has this happened?
That is simply not so.
Only 80 or 90 Members voted against.
'Nine thousand banana producers?
But it does not.
He is no doubt right.
We believe that this is unfair.
They represent only 3 % of world trade.
We want to exercise our right.
The debate is closed.
What exactly is happening?
We are now on another item.
This is the sticking point.
So, Chernobyl must be shut down.
Do the Ukrainians want to take risks?
It is true that much more is needed.
Unfortunately, that is the situation.
So the principle has been abandoned.
The year 2000 is very close.
That, I think, is the big problem.
Thank you very much, Mr Papayannakis.
The debate is adjourned.
Question Time (Commission)

I believe that is very important.
That is a very long way off.
Subject: Agreements between airlines
That is her right.
Subject: Competition policy and cartels
Which are they?

Only then can we start investigations.
It is a beauty, Commissioner.
You are right.
We did not impose it.
Subject: Government aid
These are the normal conditions.
This is very confusing.
Subject: Pesticides
That is just for your information.
The Commissioner knows that.
We are complying with that.
Please be more specific.
Thank you very much, Mrs Hardstaff.
That concludes Question Time.
The sitting is suspended.
We are looking at a specific case.
What is the bankability of Ukraine?
Are we putting money at risk?
Other aspects also arise.
Chernobyl was one catastrophe.
I think that is an absurd development.
We had experience of this in 1996.
You need to be clear on what you want.
What is the problem we face today?
These things concern all of us.
We must act.
The debate is closed.
Innovation action plan
It has been dropped again.
The debate is closed.
Industry is behind it.
However these quotas must be respected!
The Americans have also offered money.
You can buy it out - it costs peanuts.
Why has the Commission not done it?
It is not enough to prohibit sales.
It is not enough to prohibit imports.
I seek clarification.
Yes, Mr Teverson, you are quite right.
These two proposals therefore overlap.
The joint debate is closed.
Helms-Burton Act
What is intended?
And if it is, starting from when?
Therefore it is a balanced agreement.
The WTO exclusively.
We think this is unfair.
Miami vice is really not our business!
We have been very successful.
Let us start from first principles.
What are our objectives?
There is nothing mysterious about it.
The negotiation is not concluded.
That is the true position as it stands.
I had two questions.
You did not answer them.
Sovereignty does not arise.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Madam President, on a point of order.
(Applause)
Madam President, on a point of order.
It concerns the Rules of this House.
We will clarify that point.
We will see.
It appears that they have not.
I would like an answer now!
Situation in Algeria
What can the Commission do?
There have been repeated set-backs.
We must avoid two pitfalls.
The hope is clear.
There is no such thing as perfection.
This has been refused until today.
It is our duty to act.
We cannot allow ourselves to fail.
Why have these murders happened?
That struggle was enormously hard.
We should recognize that now.

Thank you, Commissioner Mar√≠n.
The debate is closed.
Situation in the Middle East
I will finish by mentioning Syria.
The special budget runs out next year.
Of course this will not happen.




That can obviously not be the case.
Everyone knows that.
In Israel it is the other way round.
Why does Netanyahu react in this way?
That is an absolute fact.
Let me give an example.
But Mr Netanyahu is mistaken.
Isolating terrorism is the only way.
And likewise Iran.
This is the price of world peace.
This seems obvious to me.
The debate is closed.
As I said, the report is conciliatory.
I have an example from my homeland.
However, improvements could be made.
My group supports this.
I also think it is unnecessary.
So it is not entirely impossible.
The debate is closed.
Votes
You did not.
Mr President, briefly.
That is tragic.
NGOs in environmental protection
We mean the word "Verbrechen' .
I am Finnish.
For this we need research.
Children hold the key to the future.
There are only six amendments in all.
The amendment contains several points.
We can remember that too.
I fully share that view.
Thank you, Mrs Bjerregaard.
The debate is closed.
CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
Mr President, Mr Fitzsimons is ill.
The poor man has pneumonia.
I am nearly finished, Mr President.
Information-sharing is another problem.
We humans simply know too little.
To learn more we must measure more.
But that costs money.
I should have no objection to that.
No.
No.
Do we use less heating?
No.
Do we use less light?
No.
Thank you, Mrs Bjerregaard.
The debate is closed.
Europe and Japan: the next steps
I put the question.
Thank you very much Mr Moorhouse.
This is the reality!
It has not been a soft approach.
We have been even-handed.
He mentioned semi-conductors.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Universal telecommunications service
But now to more serious matters.
That gives the operators clarity.
But it should just be clarified.

In addition we have various directives.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)

Please, do something about it.
The Algerian situation affects us all.
Mr President.
It is very important for Morocco.
I am talking about the eurotax disc.
Madam, I have complete faith in you.
Thank you very much, Mr Wohlfart.
I am concerned to say the least.
That is how I understood the answer.
Subject: EU structural Funds
Thank you for your answer.
So the next question is No 13.
Subject: The situation in Burma
It is democracy that is under attack.
I was one myself a few years ago.
I think we are agreed on this.
Subject: Sri Lankan assassination
I find this most distressing.
Thank you for your proposal.
My reply is the following.

Thank you very much, Mr McMahon.
What an interesting question!
Subject: Respect for social standards
Did this meeting take place?
If so, what was the outcome?
That concludes Question Time.
Green paper on commerce
There are quite a few of them.
I don't believe in subsidies.
But the sector has now grown up.

But later.
In a shop you spend money.
We have a number of shops.
We are fortunate.
Some of the traders favour it.
I welcome the Garosci report.
I have criticisms on two points.
I do too.
But is more trade better?
Mr President, I understand.
Many small retailers are self-employed.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.30 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Mr Posselt has the floor.
That is a pretty big difference.
I just wanted to draw attention to it.
Thank you, Mr Posselt.
We have no wish to be a necessary evil!
Thank you very much, Mr Habsburg.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Extradition between Member States
Parliament was not consulted.
This is not for the first time either.
That is only fair.
I believe she was here this week.
Maybe she is still coming.
I am in agreement.
They must be improved.
We are also opposed to that.
Thank you very much, Mrs Terr√≥n.
Commissioner Fischler has the floor.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12.00 noon.
Europe is the poorer for it.
I support the Torres Couto report.
It has many good things to say.
It seems a bit centralistic to me.
We can endorse all his conclusions.
Secondly, the financing of the SMEs.
Only the taxman does well out of it.
I am curious to know the answer.

This is certainly in order.
We need a change in attitudes.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Beef and veal
That is one of the key questions.
I will only accept points of order.
This is an important discussion.
That simply must be discussed.
Thank you, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Thank you, Mrs Hardstaff.
(Parliament rejected the request)
The debate continues then.
Mr Fischler now has the floor.
This proposal meets two different aims.
We will now move to the vote.
The debate will continue at 6.00 p.m.
That is the particular situation.
It would be scandalous!
Thank you, and welcome to the House!
Mr President, I am very sorry.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Welcome
Votes
It finishes there, with nothing else.
(Parliament rejected the amendment)
We submitted the amendment correctly.
I would ask the staff to check that.
What is now happening is not right!
We vote on the amendments as published.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(The President cut off the speaker)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Paragraph 8 :
We agree.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I look forward to seeing what you had.
Fitzsimmons report (A4-253/97)
Speeches alone will not suffice.
WTO panel on bananas
Nuclear power plants in Ukraine
I support this without any hesitation.
Nuclear power is not safe.
That is something I cannot accept.
Illegal imports of CFCs
Situation in Algeria
For this reason we will be abstaining.
Moorhouse report (A4-259/97)
Garosci report (A4-254/97)

No, of course, not!
And this is what is involved.
That concludes voting time.
Thank you very much, Mr Wijsenbeek.
Topical and urgent debate
What is the result?
Absolutely nothing.
That is our declared will.
What is this picture?
The Commission gave the right signal.
Thank you very much, Mr Pinheiro.
The joint debate is closed.
The explanation was simpler than that.
That was not good.
Hence the explosion.
Mr President.
There were problems, however.
What must happen?
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Secondly, how far will the reforms go?
Will that also be part of the package?
I would commend that to the House.
There is still one element of hope.
That is unthinkable today.
Everything has changed.
This situation has not improved.
Gulf States
Political prisoners are being tortured.
Naturally they are anti-Government.
One merely needs to look at a map.
They are not our enemies.
Columbia
And that goes for both sides.
We are very ready to help here.
Chile
Ethiopia
Madam President, on a point of order.
You can see that.
Madam President, on a point of order.
That is my first point.
That was the compromise proposal.
It did no such thing!
As for you yourself, you feel insulted.
We shall have three minutes for it.
Mr Maccartney has a point of order.
I wish to express my sympathy.
We were dealing with Ethiopia.
Unfortunately that did not work.
The ambassador promised a reply.
I telephoned him recently.
Inner Mongolia
It is even more serious than in Tibet.
I do ask you to consider that.
What sort of conditions are those?
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
Thank you very much, Mr Moorhouse.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
My sincere thanks, anyway.
This defies belief!
This is an achievable goal.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
This will have to be quickly addressed.
We have known about it for a long time.
Agriculture is a very big problem.
The Baltic Sea needs help now. Fast.
That sea is the Baltic.
Thank you, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Beef and veal (continuation)
But first we must ask one question.
It became effective back in 1993.
He will consider the matter.
What about other meats?
We naturally support this position.
This shows how low we have stooped.
That is how confused we have become!
However, all is not in vain.
We should support them.
That should become clearly recognised.
Some do, but not all.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.55 p.m.) .
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
This morning we have them in four.
Thank you very much Mr Wijsenbeek.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
I agree with you entirely.
Could I ask you to include Frankfurt?
(Laughter )
All right.
Thank you, Mr von Habsburg.
Votes
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
I spoke to Mr Fischler again yesterday.
This has already been delayed.
This was the whole point.
We must reject that most emphatically.
Today my speech will be quite brief.
There is support for it today, as well.
Enough about that for today.
Because what will happen then?
So why does it do this?
I would like to thank him accordingly.
Let us take fuels, for example.
It is wonderful to drive with it.
The debate is closed.
We will now vote on Mr Hallam's report.
(The Parliament adopts the resolution)
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting ended at 10.10 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
You are right, Mr Posselt.
Muchas gracias, muito obrigado!
Thank you very much.
We have...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The Minutes were approved)
(The President cut off the speaker)
This comes at a very apt time.
Thank you very much, Mr Crowley.
Request for procedure without debate
Urgent political matters
But that is no reason for resignation.
Jobs are created by enterprises.
The burden is enormous.
But what is the reality?
We have 18 million unemployed.
We propose a three-pronged approach.
I have two questions.
I mentioned the social partners.
They have a paramount role to play.
We have not yet reached that point.
So the process has not yet started.
This is a long term vision.
What does the Commission think?
This is not an impossible target.
But they have moved ahead.
But I am not satisfied with just that.
This is quite a good idea.
That cannot be taken for granted.
It is truly scandalous.
That is why I ask you this question.
But what finance is there?
That is quite right.
But things have changed and moved on.
The debate is closed.
Implementation of 1997 budget
We welcome that.
Finally, the Meda programme.
Welcome
That just about sums up our position.
We would soon strike rich then.
Their verdict? Irregularities!
(Applause from the left)
Firstly, a favourable observation.
That is a good thing.
That is humbug.
We cannot accept that any longer.
The debate is closed.
EU-Canada relations
That is a good thing.
But that is not enough.
That must change.
(The President cut off the speaker )
Both are victims of the system.
The agreement is ready to be signed.
The negotiations have been completed.
The debate is closed.
Economic and monetary union
We have our own Rhineland model.
I shall give you three factors.
Secondly: employment.
What can Europe do?
Our task here is not so great.
There are three important instruments.
That is my firm conviction.
This is explicitly mentioned.
With you, there are nuances.
Delusion or conscious distortion?
The result is the same.
EMU demands greater mobility of labour.
But the rapporteur does not do that.
Finally, this report is out of date.
It is turning its back on the future.
There is a fundamental last question.
Of course, no-one wants that!
I think that is important.
Thank you.
That is where have to start.
The Euro is not an end in itself.
The debate is closed.
Convention on the Law of the Sea
Firstly, a basic problem.
The decision seems to me unfortunate.
Unfortunately we cannot avoid this.
The debate is closed.
We see it in exactly the same way.
I find that sentence very amusing!
It is pure fiction.
That is what is at stake.
We can do without that!
Welcome
You beat me by two years.
We have worked together for years.
The debate is closed.
EU-Asean Relations

Who ASEAN admits is ASEAN's business.
Thank you.
But just what is booming at present?
What can we conclude from this?
Why did they not work?
Were they burnt to death?
I think he did the right thing.
It was killing while Nazism killed.
In 1997, it is still killing.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
But that is easier said than done.
Finally, smog.
Thank you President.
Why did it not work?
What are we doing about this problem?
This is a debate for the future.
That is simple, Mr President.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The debate is closed.

The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Thank you very much, Mr Andrews.
EU-ACP relations for the 21st Century

This agreement is over 20 years old.
Experience has shown the opposite.


Thank you very much, Mrs Barthet-Mayer.
Thank you!

It is another world.
Here is the way out of poverty.
We are very interested in that.
Firstly, the question of trade.
I cannot understand it.
On the contrary.
Thank you, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Transport of live animals
Such situations are unacceptable.
That is for a number of reasons.
It is also not good for the consumer.
That is incomprehensible.
I now feel that I am repeating myself.
So it doesn't happen.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
That is Finland's official position.
That problem must be solved first.
We should take that to heart.
Horses are timid flight animals.
That takes place every day.
That has got to change!
This is what must be attacked.
We need action in this area.
I wish to stress four points.
Meat can be transported deep-frozen.
In reality not very much has happened.
That is the only reasonable option.
So use them, for God's sake!
Now I come to the main problem.
That is the actual core of the problem.
That must be our primary objective.
I will mention a few examples.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Votes
(Parliament approved the request)
I hope that is clear.
Are there any objections?
There are not.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
.

There are not.
On Amendment No 4
"Especially' narrows the definition.
This is one of the possibilities.
There are not.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
In fact they should no longer be there.
That is paragraph 22.
That also applies to the German.
So could you please check those too.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That is something I cannot accept.
The EU is not a state.
Pettinari Report (A4-221/97)
Hindley Report (A4-0195/97)
And they are entitled to their opinion.
End of story!
Hindley Report (A4-0262/97)
We have no objection to that.
Graziani Report (A4-0140/97)
Willockx Report (A4-0255/97)
It is only the tip of the iceberg.
I cannot support that policy.
That is why I voted against the report.
Alber Report (A4-0276/97)
At first, nothing.
Martens Report (A4-0274/97)
van Dijk Report (A4-0266/97)
I congratulate the rapporteur.
I have doubts for three reasons.
We of course voted against this point.
I agree completely with this statement.
That concludes the votes.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
This issue concerns me too.
What is this all about?
I shall let you be the judge.
She too has signed for 500 Florins.
Everyone is fully aware of that.

(Sustained applause)
Several people want to speak.
Mr Kreissl-D√∂rfler has the floor.
I doubt they could stand the pace.
We simply will not stand for it.
We support them all, of course.
That is something special.
We sign attendance lists.
We do not need this type of journalism.
It was a cowardly attack on them.
Mr President, I have two comments.
That is quite untrue.
Thank you very much, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy.
(The Minutes were approved)
Calendar of part-sessions 1998
We have a choice of two solutions.
Order of business
Fine!
Why?
But in fact it can.
I am therefore in favour.
Mrs Green may now move the request.
We would ask the plenary to agree.
Nobody opposes the request, then.
(Parliament approved the request)
So let us be quite clear about it.
We are all equal before the law.
This matter needs to be cleared up.
It happens all the time in politics.
Now, no-one dares to fire a shot.
That is what has happened to him!
The debate is closed.
Satellite communications
The objectives of this are quite clear.
We must therefore put a lot into this.
But development never stands still.
It is really just a reference.
Maybe he should pay them a visit.
But I only say that in passing.
Now to the Member States.
The debate is closed.

I have mixed feelings and some doubts.
That is not so.
We had three choices.
The second item is of course welcome.
Yet we are doing nothing to change it.
This is madness!
This is a disgrace.
Thank you for your generosity!
There is a big difference here.
This is not just parliamentary talk.
That is not acceptable, obviously.
The debate is closed.
Legal protection of designs
This is a very important report.
Then there is the consumer issue.
Last night, the word "copy' was used.
Of course we do not want this.
Jobs are going to be lost there too.
But we want to remain consistent.
Thank you, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.15 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Mr Medina Ortega has the floor.
It is just a small detail.
But I do want to thank you.
Mr President, on the same point.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The Minutes were approved)
Decision on urgency
European Council on Employment
That is not a dream, that is reality.
It will not be quietly forgotten.
The Amsterdam Treaty has been signed.
That is essential.
This again is, in my view, unique.
That has not happened here.
That is what this summit is about.
That is in any case the intention.
So, how can we act concretely?
ECU 50 million could thus be freed up.
What is different now?
For that spirit is needed.
That is what I am hoping for.
Attractive objectives are set.
But what are the means proposed?
The means exist to do this.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This policy must now be ended.
The alternative is clear.
The whole deck needs reshuffling.
The over-50s are often involved.
They are tired of speeches.
My answer is definitely no.
Opinions vary.
It is important to act now.
Hence today's report.
It is a radical change of perspective.
We need concrete results here.
The EIB has a role to play here.
Great!
But how and who is going to pay for it?
And forced to work shorter hours.
And after all that is also important.
Amsterdam has set a clear assignment.

We do not want quick fixes.
Best wishes to the Luxembourg Summit!
I see three main areas for action.

Finally, the TEN project.

Of course we need economic growth.
First, the transeuropean networks.
We must cure ourselves of that.
All too often we tend to over-educate.
Secondly, we need more jobs for women.
Thirdly, we need new ideas.
We have produced enough ideas.
We can work less and produce more.
This is not the Europe we want.
Job creation is the keyword.
It is now or never!
That must be very obvious to us all.
Happily things are changing.
We did all of this before.
The arithmetic is quite simple.
We can achieve that 3 % increase.
Thank you, Commissioner Flynn.
The debate is closed.
Votes
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Industrial accidents (C4-0469/97)
Bonn Convention (C4-0470/97)
Fayot report (A4-0311/97)
van Velzen report (A4-0307/97)
This Summit cannot fail.
I want to congratulate them on that.
By whom? And when?
This construction has two requirements:
Why not 5 %, even 3 %?
That concludes the votes.
This is a sad situation.
This is no mean feat in this House.


We have reached the pain barrier here.
We have problems with legal bases.
Welcome
There is a 'but' coming up shortly.
At times it has not been easy.
That is a first, so far as I know.
It has shown that it has been working.
Now it is up to the Commission.
It is excessive for three reasons.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Let us turn to Mr Tomlinson's report.
Parliament is exceeding its powers.
I think that is very clear.
Thank you.
We understand their argument.
That is a good move.
That is why we need regulations.
We should also have that for ourselves.
We must have regulations.
The joint debate is closed.
Government procurement
The Green Paper is a policy paper.
What can we do in the short term?
This seems a reasonable position.
We have a chance here with this report.
The need is evident.
Therefore dissemination is important.
Several new cases are in progress.
We should not forget that.
Those are our party objectives.
Does anything happen?
No!
Where are the sanctions?
Who are we to blame?
That is what Mr Tappin says.
Nobody knows.

The debate is closed.
This seems a lot to me.
The debate is closed.
Fight against fraud
Let me cite another instance.
It keeps cropping up.
We are still waiting for you!
What is our view of UCLAF's role?
It is a good way of working.
We will never be able to do that.
I think that is a clear improvement.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
That was my simple question.
I believe that could be valuable.
Subject: Forest fires in Indonesia
Subject: Cancellation of CMAF Funding
That is a pretty confusing reply.
His reply was confusing on that point.
That, however, did not prove possible.
Question No 40 by Roy Perry (H-0732/97)
Subject: Nuclear safety
Subject: Natura 2000 and military zones
Something has astonished me.
This could be for various reasons.
But we will certainly do as you say.
They can be helped in any country.
Subject: Europe against cancer
One-quarter will die from the disease.
I am grateful for his interest.
That is all I can say.
That was last December.
That concludes Question Time.

That is one point.
What will happen?
Thank you very much, Mr Van den Broek.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.17 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
I hope we can react accordingly.
I will not have a debate on the matter.
That will be corrected.
Perhaps I did not sign.
Could the Minutes please be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
I understand the Rules are quite clear.
My group was told that was the case.
Very well.
I said that to all your colleagues.
Hence, let us have real ambition.
Let us act to make it a turning point.
It must be simple, it must be yes.
Our response must also be honest.
There will be no group negotiations.
That is not acceptable.
We must have an influential presence.
Those who want peace, want Europe.
(Sustained applause)
Thank you very much, President Santer.
The single currency.
This is a very delicate point.
Citizens' quality of life.
But is Europe ready for the euro?
A second risk concerns interest.
But that is not all.
That calls for a number of reforms.
Then there are parliamentary enquiries.
This work has to continue.
The art is knowing how to set limits.
So we want to register our delight.
Nevertheless, we must strike a balance.
Who decides in the European Union?
Who is responsible?
To whom are they accountable?
We lack a political strategy.
This is the financial question.
What future, Mr President?

Where will the new jobs come from?
We have to pursue both aims.


I think that is a good start!
(Applause)
That is exactly what Europe needs!
Europe needs vision!
Europe needs social democracy.
Europe is pan-European.
People must be convinced of this.
Yes, honestly and truly.
What needs to be done is immense.
One moment, Mr Santer.
I ask for silence from all.
I think we should all be very pleased.
That is what I said this morning.
Votes
I shall speak on Amendment No 1.
Mr President, on a point of order.
In that case, I withdraw my amendment.
(Parliament adopted the proposal)
(Applause)
And this happens constantly!
Mr Herman, that is the rule.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President.
That has never happened.
No.
Kaklamanis recommendation (A4-0296/97)
In this I am not alone.
Castellina report (√Å4-0305/97)
Baldarelli report (A4-0275/97)
Tappin report (A4-0309/97)
B√∂sch report (A4-0287/97)
That concludes voting time.
Protection of displaced persons
We read about them every week.
How long should it take?
The proposal is vague on that point.
What is the problem then?
It is obviously impossible.

We must help each other.
These are sensitive issues.
I have known her for many years.
I congratulate her on it.
We find it very sound.
It is carefully worded.
It is a terrible thing to be displaced.
It is not something you do yourself.
That is about all.
We must find solutions to it.
Mr Gollnisch belongs amongst them.
That is upheld in this House.
I say this as a German and a European.
She did not react to it in her answer.
That is my specific question.
The debate is closed.
Cocoa, chocolate, coffee and chicory
It has many weak points.
I think the reply is no, Mr President.
What are our objections?
I shall go through them again.
It really is a disgraceful proposal.
I have two comments to make on this.
But what does this mean exactly?
I believe them.
Do they have something to hide?
An excellent principle!
One rule for everyone, no exceptions.
A second appeal.
We want to safeguard his rights.
Just one final point.
But let us try for the best option.
You do an impact study beforehand.
Thank you very much, Mrs Maij-Weggen.
And I note that fact.
You may not do so now.
So something certainly has to be done.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
For this the recipe is enough.
Everything is imminent, just as before.
There has been not a jot of progress.
I hope we can, but I doubt it.
The breach was now open.
We all surely agree on that.
The same applies to other chocolate.
But what is chocolate?

I will now enlighten him.
The common market is not working.
What are we dealing with here?
Rubbish!
Let consumers have a choice.
And about time!
But that is not the logic of politics.
That was, and still is, rubbish.
And so we ask why?
Why these and not other choices?
I hope so.
Stick to it, Mrs Gradin!
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
Mr von Habsburg has the floor.
Thank you, Mr von Habsburg.
Thank you, Mr Wohlfart.
I would say simply this.
I can give you no other answer.

Thank you, Mr President.
I do not think this is a final date.
Subject: Treaty of Amsterdam
Thank you, Mr Wohlfart.
That question was never answered.
I am not asking for an answer now.
We are sure to return to this debate.
Subject: Developing country debt
Subject: Agenda 2000
Let us not waste it.
Thank you very much for your answer.
It was a very positive answer.
I am not so sure of that.
In fact, I am going to try and reply.
Subject: Abolition of Duty Free sales
Why do I say this?
Anyway, it could disturb our business.
And I am continuing that fight.
And we are talking of 2, 500 employees.
I have nothing else to say.
Thank you, Mr Cushnahan.
You are already aware of the matter.
Insurance undertakings
That is exceptional.
Insurance is an important issue.
This is unfortunate.
Why are they included in the scope?
The debate is closed.
Copyright and related rights
No!
I am not sure that we have succeeded.
The developments are rapid.
But what sort of law is copyright law?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Food additives
Prevention is more important than cure.
Marking of food is the alpha and omega.
So we must know what food contains.
Then there is Amendment No 32.
Here I am torn both ways.
I will come back to this later.
Medicine should be kept out of food.
There are three points I want to make.
Ms McKenna has referred to this.
That is my question to the Commission.
I see that Mrs Schleicher is nodding.
Mr Commissioner.
That's not the problem at all.

The other question on Amendment No 42.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Socrates action programme
He is sorry, but he cannot do it.
We want it.
The Council owes us proof.
How generous!
Parliament is very moderate. Really.
We are not quite so moderate.
We remain under this today.
One cannot be more moderate.
No one can deny that.
It is of proven interest.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.17 p.m.)
Madam President, I have a question.
That is the first question.

This, I am sure, is incorrect.
Mr Tomlinson, we heard you.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Madam President, I request your help.
We will make the correction.
(The Minutes were approved)
Madam President, on a point of order.
I would like some clarification here.
Madam President, on a point of order.
Thank you, Mr Tomlinson.
It is quite unacceptable.
I think you understand me.
I hope that will happen.
We must be very careful.
Thank you, Mr Tillich.
On Amendment No 127
On the remarks of Amendment No 199
It is a voluntary scheme.
Anyone who wishes to leave, can leave.
I invite the House to vote against.
(Mixed reactions)
Thank you very much, Mrs Sandbaek.
Now to Amendment No 20.
Tillich report (A4-0290/97)
We have abstained from voting.
We are entirely opposed to that.
Tomlinson report (A4-0280/97)

This is perfectly obvious.
I have also signed several of them.
Mosiek-Urbahn report (A4-0295/97)
Breyer report (A4-0281/97)
I regret and condemn this attitude.
What consumers want is clear.
So why forbid it for grape juice?
Wiebenga report (A4-0284/97)
And if so, what solutions?
Topical and urgent debate
Horror and revulsion!
I thank him for being there.
We must act.
Why continue the dialogue?
These efforts must be encouraged.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
It is a sad country.
Some would say: ' So what?
A soft landing would suit us all.
This is really insanity.
Let us be honest with ourselves.
That is not acceptable to us.
We shall not forget that.
I was in the presence of a cult.
There is no doubt about it.
It is strange and weird.
But we are in a dilemma here.
That is not what we are about here.
We must continue with the dialogue.
They are looking for joint ventures.
They want help with new technology.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Democratic Republic of Congo
We found that before with Mobutu.
This debate is supposed to be topical.
China
I would like him to bear that in mind.
Kosovo
I now put three simple questions.
I should have been delighted to do so.
We have got to do something at last.
We snivel, but we do nothing.
We have got to use pressure.
Belgrade will not be forced.
We know that from experience.
Souha Bechara
She was 21 when she went in.
Slovakia
Kovacs is on the side of the people.
The European Union can wait.
Algeria
I doubt it.
I say that these are excuses.
By being silent, we become accomplices.
No, no, no!
No more standing still!
The European Union must declare itself!
Algeria is a Mediterranean partner.
Here I agree with Mrs Andr√©-L√©onard.
This is an unacceptable situation.
Why this initiative?
That is regrettable.
The third problem is that of Kosovo.
The fifth subject concerns Slovakia.
Lastly, Algeria.
The debate is closed.
The Commission should help us in this.
The debate is closed.
Earthquakes in central Italy
But help will soon be on the way.
Floods in Spain
Fires in Brazil
And that is true.
Hurricane in Mexico
Acryl amide poisoning in Sweden
Of this 400 tons is pure Acryl amide.
Nobody knows.
Since then, the work has stopped.
Food aid is also included.
Votes
It is not before time.
New technologies and the press
This is important.
I support self-regulation.
To my mind this is an unhealthy trend.
I hope that will happen.
This has to be a good thing.
Technological progress is inevitable.
Press freedom can come under pressure.
And it also ensures pluralism.
I shall be brief, Mr President.
Firstly, from outside the press.
I should like to begin with that.
That is what I wanted to clear up.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Protection of minors and human dignity
What are we saying here?

There is confusion.
I don't think so. It's obvious.
And we come across that everywhere.
There is an analogy between the two.
It is important that this is included.
Freedom of expression is a great thing.
But we have a problem here.
Thank goodness she was there.
They want to cooperate.
Work with them.

We must start there.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
And that should not surprise us.
We must insist.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 9.01 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
I seek some clarification.
I would appreciate some clarification.
We are still on the Minutes.
I ask for that to be checked.
I should like that checked again.
(The Minutes were approved)
The matter will be discussed again.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The Minutes have already been approved.
Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, I am sorry.
There must be no more debate.
The Minutes have already been approved.
Votes
- Daskalaki report (A4-289/97)
This is not a question for the EU.
Market organization in beef and veal
It is a very balanced report.
This is clearly justifiable.
Export refund are economic nonsense.
We must keep out of this.
That is the problem.
We should stop immediately.
I am here.

What are our possibilities?
That is where we are now.
That is the problem.
We should be guided by this principle.
Madam President, on a point of order.
We ought to know.
Naturally I have an interest.
I look at that rather differently.
This really ought to be stopped.
This is obviously a difficult problem.


But this is unrealistic.
What is going on is unacceptable.
The writing is on the wall.
We cannot support this any longer.
And why is this point unequivocal?
And I therefore protest!
It rightly outraged the Finnish people.
This would lead to discrimination.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
You are right, Mrs Pack.
That will be recorded.
You cannot record it.
It leads to subsidizing cruelty.
Support the ending of export subsidies.
Apples, pears, peaches and nectarines
As usual, he has done an excellent job.
I welcome this development.
This report has not yet been published.
Now the measures also include pears.
Very well, that is a joke.
We hope that will happen.
I do not think so.
Madam President.
We want the market to decide the rules.
Is that what it all comes down to?
Do we have them to blame for all that?
Certainly not.
We therefore reject Amendment No 6.
Let me say that this is going to fail.
It will not lead to any savings.


The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Madam President, I have a problem.
I gave no one any such order.
I would ask you to take note of that.
I would like to vote.
And that you can do.
No, Mr President!
Madam President.
I would ask you to enquire into it.
I am agog to know what will transpire.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 11.24 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Of course that is not true.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
We cannot vote on this tomorrow.
That would be quite absurd.
The position is very clear then.
That is in the Amsterdam Treaty.
Urgent political matters
There are none.
It would have to wait for Poland' .
However, I would go even further.
That will certainly take time.
If so, how is this to be achieved?
That was pretty unequivocal.
That is no coincidence.
One tries to maintain a balance.
The same goes for the east.
They should be credited for it.
After all, what was Slovakia told?
But the reverse is true as well.
Some may advance sooner than others.
It could be conducted another time.
One could give several answers.
It is not a one-factor problem.
You are entirely right.
(The President cut off the speaker)
It seems to me that it does not.
That is not his job.
I am grateful to the honourable Member.
I hope that is clearly understood.
We appreciate it.
Each truck is losing ¬£1, 000 per day.
We cannot afford that.
But nothing has happened.
I am sure she understands that.
There were a great many.
Child sex abuse
I consider this essential!
(Applause)
And it should not be any other way.
And that is true.
He is a European judge.
The blanket of secrecy has been lifted.
Furthermore, prevention is essential.
That is the main problem.
Understand that if you can!
That is a fact.
Things have changed.
We are not the Belgian Parliament.
Perhaps that would be desirable.
But today there is nothing.
This is the most delicate aspect.
It is an ethical imperative.
What is there to be done?
But the important thing is prevention.
Four things.
The debate is closed.
Common fisheries policy after 2002
Amongst these I would mention:
So what does the report suggest?
That is exceptionally important.
What is involved?
Here we have a comprehensive report.
What does that tell us?
So how have we to move ahead?
The answer to that is regionalization.
It was unacceptable.
Why?
Quotas should not be nationalized.
Management is the key to the future.
Where will these people find work?

We should congratulate her.
Relative stability is there.
That seems sensible.
It is not coming in 1997 I fear.
Let it come in early 1998.
Thank you, Commissioner Papoutsis.
The debate is closed.
Sexual Discrimination
The same applies to the procedures.
I am not as negative as Mrs van Dijk.
Are you still sticking to that?
I would say it is worth sticking to it.
I am in full agreement with that text.
Are you sticking to this?
It has a lot of potholes.
The debate is closed.
Phare
What does this mean?
I certainly couldn't tell you!
The debate is closed.
Andr√© Sainjon has done excellent work.
That is a key question.
I sincerely believe that they are not.
Is it naivety?
Voluntary codes of conduct will not do.
Very little.
That is a great pity.
That was well recognized by Mr Caudron.
The debate is closed.
The second point is important.
This is the diameter of coins.
How do we get that figure?
That was the original proposal.
What is our role here as a Parliament?
They do not care what we say!
We need to readdress this question.
So this is of vital importance.
And we support that.
We are also keen on the idea of gold.
I believe this has real value.
It would be awfully confusing.
The report is otherwise excellent.
Six would be enough.
It is an excellent, durable material.
But back to coins.
Let me just end with another point.
I am sure of that.
First, on the number of coins.
It is just nonsense.
So it is all rubbish.
And for what reason?
It is the issue of equality and class.
That is just a sop!
This is not the right way.
That is surely the wrong way!
I think that is very tedious.
In both cases I find it unacceptable.
The debate is closed.
Passenger ship safety
This is important.
That is, of course, a good thing.
In some cases, alas, that is not so.
We welcome it for that reason as well.
The debate is closed.
Fishing vessel safety
The debate is closed.
Promotion of renewable energy sources
Just two further brief remarks.
Let us consider what has gone before.
It is in the spirit of the age.
There is not enough money.
There is not enough money.
There is not enough money.
I hope my meaning is clear.
That sounds like a lot of money.
The same is true for Amendment No 3.
The debate is closed.
Fisheries agreement with Mauritania
Those are the two problems, therefore.
Thank you, Madam Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.30 a.m.)
Thank you, Mr McCartin.
We shall get back to you later.
Social protection
But now the debate has shifted.
The deadlock has been broken.
That is employment.
First, cross-border workers.
First, the demographic challenge.

Those are two quite simple objectives.

I am not so sure she is right.
I mentioned the change in conditions.
But I have a few comments to make.
It means modernizing it.
I see this as a considerable advance.
Thank you, Commissioner Flynn.
The debate is closed.
1996 report on competition policy
His doctors have told him to rest.
Information must be made public.
His report is coherent.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Votes
on paragraph 25
Mr President, please bear with me.
That is not in the text now.
on paragraph 29
I do not want to go along with that.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
So I agree with Mr Macartney.
May I request that they be withdrawn?
Mr President, certainly not.
It is our right to insist and we do so.
Agreed, I am sorry.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I hope my colleagues will support this.
I ask this House to reject the motion.
That seems to me the simplest solution.
On Amendment No 12
On Paragraph 15
You have not done that!
On Amendment No 21
On Amendment No 7
(Mr Crowley refused)
There is nothing more to vote on.
On Amendment No 14
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
The first one is paragraph 24.
You refused.
The answer is yes, of course.
But there is also something else.
Coin it for Europe's citizens!
That is what I say.
The Danish Social Democrats agree.
So they should not contain nickel.
Ghilardotti report (A4-0326/97)
Such discrimination targets women.
We cannot hide behind words!
For several reasons.
Bloch von Blottnitz report (A4-0288/97)
I read it with real interest.
It is simply essential.
Imaz San Miguel report (A4-0303/97)
What has happened to that project?
Schulz report (A4-0306/97)


But I want to make three points.
Fraga Est√©vez report (A4-0298/97)
The EU will have to monitor them.
Weiler report (A4-0291/97)
Social policy is a national matter.
Areitio Toledo report (A4-0316/97)
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 1.05 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr President, on a point of order.
(Mixed reactions)
Mr President, on a point of order.
The decision has been taken.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Please bear that in mind.
Order of business
The next item is the order of business.
Monday:
The vote will be taken on Thursday.
Tuesday and Wednesday: no changes.
Thursday:
I move that it should not be adjourned.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
(Parliament approved the proposal)
I very much support this proposition.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
Thank you very much, Mr Guti√©rrez.
Question Time must be strictly taboo.
Friday: no changes.
Climate change
The next item is the joint debate on:
And where are those?
The USA cannot ignore the problem.
What can we hope to achieve at Tokyo?
And ambitious is the key word.
Perhaps I can mention a few examples.
I think that is the right idea.
How is that to be achieved in the time?
My second comment relates to energy.
It is, quite simply, nuclear energy.
That is a lie.
This is quite possible.
It is dreadfully poor.
That is disgraceful.
Fuel cells, a technology of the future.
You get novel experiences.
But trading permits seem to work.
We disagree on the objectives.
How fast should it progress?
We have got to act now!
We must promote them.
Burden-sharing is a good thing.
That is what we actually have.
We all have the future in our hands.
If so, what are these means?
Are you willing to use them?
Trees absorb carbon dioxide.
That has already been said.
I believe the opposite is the case.
We can give many good reasons for that.
We even managed to reduce emissions.
Nobody can prevent it.
No agreement can avoid it.
So we need to find alternatives.
It is a big problem.
The debate is closed.
Customs union with Turkey
This imbalance is ruinous for Turkey.
So, there is more ambiguity than ever.
That fear seems grossly exaggerated.
That is more than enough.
The debate is closed.
Higher education
I support this for its own sake.
Vigilance is therefore called for.
This paper goes some way towards that.
So we have not even tried.
The debate is closed.
The answer was 1969.
I have checked the matter and it is.
A yet more eminent one did so recently.
Why is there such a legal obligation?
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.15 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Mr Wynn may speak.
I will be, Mr Wynn.
I heard you so it will be corrected.
The point, Mr President, ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The Minutes were approved)
Decision on urgency
This is an intolerable situation!
Thank you very much, Mr Thomas.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
Mr Friedmann has the floor.
That cannot be right!
The same applies to commitments.
Thanks for his trouble!
I thank you for your attention.
(Applause)
It has not always been easy.
Briefly, some other observations.
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
Mr President, I have four questions.
Can you give us some idea of that?
What is your response to that?
We would be very pleased!
That is my general question.
I just want to ask three questions.
Can we give recommendations?
The MEP also addressed this subject.
I am not satisfied with the situation.
They are remarkably high.
This audit is in progress.
You are quite right!
That need not be so!
Europe is big enough.
Thank you for your attention.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr President!
The debate is closed.
BSE
The next item is the joint debate on:
Read the report very carefully!
(Applause)
Effort!
There could not be a bigger contrast.
Neither did I, to be honest!
We will be very watchful!
We should be making that case here.
Then the Commission will move.
This is in fact more than we expected.

Are the storehouses safe?
Do the controls offer real safety?
Why, Mr Boden?
Just tell me.
Can you tell us?
That is looking back.
We think that is extremely important.
To my mind that logic is unacceptable.

We must now look to the future.
As I say, we must now move on.
I look forward to that.
I wish you well in the future.

In any case, we can always hope.
Thank you for your presence here today.
We felt more isolated a few months ago.
There is no divergence here.
I agree with you entirely.
Thank you!
The UK Government welcomes this report.
We have not achieved everything.
There we will not let go!
Mr President, I will try to be brief.
That is a scandal!
Mr President, very briefly, of course.
I come back to my image.
The debate will continue at 3 p.m.
Votes
That is not a point of order.
I must therefore ask you to stop.
Colino Salamanca report (A4-0330/97)
Heinisch Report (A4-0358/97)
No-one.
In fact, many imprecisions remain.
Kittelmann Report (A4-0276/97)
That concludes voting time.
BSE (continuation)
That is a political fact.
What exactly is going on?
One cannot be careful enough with food.
We have learned a great deal.
We shall see how it goes.
It is very important.
I was a member of both.
I do not support this criticism.
We all need fully to recognize this.
So what more have we to do?
I can only regret that.
Speed up the recruiting process.
So there is no excuse.
You can and should do it.
So do it!
Of course, I want to be fair.
They have not learnt their lesson.
There is no question about that.
I say yes.
That is the starting point.
That is my problem.
That is the point.
We cannot make a general statement.
We now have greater openness.
Mr President, I congratulate you.
You have made a good move.
Is the truth frightening?
Quite clearly so.
For what?
For health?
No.
Against fraud?
No.
(The President cut off the speaker)
We must name names!
This is all I wanted to say.
The debate is closed.
European systems of worker involvement
They also mean economic productivity.
This has been the case for a long time.

So what is the problem?
That must not be allowed to happen.
Thank you all once again.
The debate is closed.
Part-time work - Employment
Yet we have nothing to celebrate.
But there is more.
But this is not the case!
The social dialogue is a tender plant.
Here there is more to be done.
Only that meets our social obligations.
Investment is the key.
There is little I can add to that.
It was not an easy report.
We know that.
We can reject the agreement.
And the matter does not end there.
Yet, what do we discover?
There are not many days left to go.
Very good.
But the keyword is entrepreneurship.
We need a positive business climate.
We need simpler and cheaper services.
We also need lots of local solutions.
That is not how things work.
That group is older women.
That is not true.
Question Time (Commission)
There is some truth in that.
Subject: Primates as laboratory animals
We can then decide what tools to use.
Subject: Environmental assessment
Could she address my specific points?
We must respect that.
Therefore, please keep to time.
I am a second son, Mr President.
The answer is yes, there are.
However, that will take time.
Subject: Fundamental freedoms in Cuba
Absolutely not!
That is all I can say to you.
I do not accept that at all.
Of course I am aware of them.
I will willingly repeat it.
Nothing else!
It does not take a political position.
I think that must be enough!
Subject: The Millennium 'Bug'
So they saved costs.
That is not cheap.
Thank you for that reply.
Everything has two sides.
That is only a provisional answer.
The solutions are there now.
There are two problems.
For one thing, they are expensive.
Are we totally unprepared?
I welcome that answer.
We therefore check all these things.
Subject: Agenda 2000
Will it be a joint decision?
Will it be a Commission decision?
Will it be NUTS 1, NUTS 2, or NUTS 3?
When is the decision likely to be made?
Who decides?
Third question: when?
I will willingly do that, Mr President.
That concludes Question Time.
Thank you, Mrs Carlsson.
But how could he have overlooked you?
It was when it was brought into effect.
This work is not atypical, far from it.
I would like to cite three points.
They have to find ways to combine both.
I am delighted with that.
We cannot be satisfied with this.
That is what is different.
I hope it will convert.
We all know that.
I appreciate it personally.
We ask to take care of it in general.
The answer is yes.
Thank you, Mr Flynn
The joint debate is closed.
Aircraft safety
Many thanks, Mr Kinnock
The debate is closed.
Economic and social cohesion
It is not.


Are we to allow this to continue?
I will talk about this later.

It is a dangerous strait-jacket.
It would be like punishing virtue.
What should we do?
Here I must contradict Mr Rack.
Should we also be tightening our belts?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Madam Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I should like to relate an anecdote.
Things have improved since then.
We hope to increase it further.
We need more accountability.
There is little doubt about that.
We need to see real transparency.
That is very important.
Monitoring is very important.
That has happened in this case.
The debate is closed.
Practice of the profession of lawyer


And this is what has happened today.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.
This is no small step, Madam President.
Thank you, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
In most cases this means women.
Let us do better in the future.
Our group approves the report.
Who is listening to us anyway?
There is no-one here but ourselves.
We all know what our opinions are.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 0.25 a.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
(The President cut off the speaker)
That was my first question.
The second question.
Now they must be implemented.
Thank you, Mr De Vries.
I hope I have allayed your concerns.
(Closing formula and signature)' .
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Why do I ask for this statement?
Thank you, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
That is a request under Rule 37.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I would endorse the request.
And I regret that.
Are there any objections?
You know the Rules better than I do.
Mr Pasty is quite right.
I shall put my proposal to the vote.
Topical and urgent debate
Before subject I
In fact, we all know that...
Mr Aldo, I cannot let you continue.
Rule 127a, Madam President.
I request thirty seconds.
Treaty of Amsterdam
That was a good thing, in my view.
And this method is a Community method.

Choosing the road means moving forward.
The Treaty of Amsterdam is a road.
What is the outcome?
Thank you for your patience.
In other words, not EMU, but SMU.
The same applies to codecision.
There is a need for improvement here.
We cannot afford this!
This is a long and significant list.
This is a major development!
There are always steps forward.
Why?
I shall not speak about content.
But what are those shortfalls?
And are they without consequence?
A risky bet if ever there was one!
They will be repressed.
Federalism never made anyone happy.
There is no other solution.

Another is to reject it.
Almost everyone has said that.
We have to tackle it with decisiveness.
In my view, this is very important.
This is new language.

Civil society must also participate.
Fourth, home affairs and justice.
That is one side of the coin.
Not at all!
Europe, that means its citizens.
Here you have nothing to say.
You remain sterile.
I do not think so.
I find it is merely mediocre.
They did not do so.
So what should we do?
Yet what is the truth?
Let us not be blind.
The large gap is institutional.
Everyone recognizes that.
That is a sound proposal.
Votes
(Parliament adopted the decision)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
This is highly regrettable.
I should like this to be recorded.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)

Fontaine report (A4-0337/97)
Dell'Alba report (A4-0345/97)
I voted yes to the report.
J√∂ns report (A4-0352/97)
Junker report (A4-0318/97)
Mrs Junker talks about equal rights.
But they are by no means sufficient.
That at least will achieve something!
This is expressed in the amendments.
Guti√©rrez D√≠az report (A4-0317/97)
I would like to congratulate him.
But we must go even further.
I do not agree with that.
BSE
This was an absolute necessity.
We could not have done otherwise.
Menrad report (A4-0354/97)
The reality is quite different.
Ultraliberalism crushes democracy.
Hernandez Mollar (A4-0353/97)

For us the report is a disappointment.
Izquierdo Collado (A4-0324/97)
No more funding for the cities.
The report is very full.
These promises must be kept.
What can be deduced from this?
In a word, this is good work.
Quite the contrary.
We want nothing to do with it.
That concludes voting time.
On a point of order.
Treaty of Amsterdam (continuation)
We should admit this quite openly.
I adopt a realistic position.
Why?
Everyone says so, and they are right.

They have been alluded to already.
There is time to do it.
It must be done.
But in time for what?
No.

Perhaps not.
Now let us move on to the future.
Governments have responded.
This is the real problem.
And finally, the fourth question.
The treaty itself is thin.
That cannot be denied.
I will illustrate this.
That means a lot of time is lost.
But it could be better.
I gave away nothing.
The debate is closed.
EU/USA summit and trade relations
We can and will do more.
It has not helped the common objective.
It has hindered it.
To do so we turned to the WTO.
Thank you Sir Leon.
We will have to define that concept.
The results are in front of us.
False friends are no use to anybody.
Fine.

Perhaps that is one of the problems.
What are we doing in the Baltic?
What are we doing in the Middle East?
All this is very sensible.
Partnership has been mentioned.
That is my hope.
That already is an important point.
I will add just one thing.
That I very much agree with.
We are seeking a definitive solution.
Again, I would welcome that.
The debate is closed.
Votes
(Applause from the Green Group)
It is in many respects a failure.
That was why I voted the way I did.
This is not what the peoples want.
There is a reason for this obscurity.
This is a pure illusion.
This ideal is evidently out of fashion.

I think not.
It is far from that.
It is unacceptable.
We have voted no to the report.
It did not work.
Question Time (Council)
Subject: The situation in Algeria
We must try to do so.
Is this correct?
That is, of course, good news.
I think this is a clear position.
I have two supplementary questions.
It will be immune from the law.
And that is the context of my reply.
This right will be respected.
There are many different opinions.
What is the Council's interpretation?
Let me explain.
This is a very good question.
Evidently they are not correct.
That is also what happens.
It is necessary, but it is expensive.
We cannot do that today.
Is that it?
Salmonella in itself is one problem.
The questioners have emphasized this.
I would not wish to speculate further.
Salmonella is part of everyday life.
We are well and truly into salmonella!
This is a personal opinion.
I can only repeat this.
Subject: Road hauliers
I shall be extremely brief.
Let me explain.
Subject: Legal rights of asylum-seekers
I shall now try to perform my duties.



Subject: Child labour in West Africa
Thank you for your response.
What more can Europe do?
Thank you, Mr Wohlfart.
Action plan for the single market
That is what we have this summit for.
We find it in the Delors White Paper.
But how can we adjust this trend?
It would be a good first step, I think.
Real profit can be made here.
We need a new 1992.
A last remark.
It is clearly not.
I can assure you it is no such thing.
It offers a choice of action points.
Something for everyone.
I regret this.
That is a real good news story.
What is the difference?
The debate is closed.
Construction products
We must try to make the effort.
What exactly is the value of this?
The debate is closed.
Indirect taxation systems (Fiscalis)
I will be brief.
This is an excellent report.
We welcome the Commission's proposals.
This is certainly the case in the UK.
The debate is closed.
It was called something else then.
That was secured.
This concern has also been met.
I am coming to end, Mr President.
Let me pick out three points.
The second issue is new technology.
This poses new problems.
New solutions need to be found.
I would like to support his report.
The debate is closed.
The interest it generated was huge.
(The sitting was closed at 11: 35 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
(The Minutes were approved)
Decision on urgency
(Parliament rejected the request)
Organized crime
Joint action is required.
I am more specific on some points.
We must establish a definition.
That is the basic question!
I think that was very important.
The Amsterdam summit adopted the plans.
I completely agree.
We need both.
That is the first obvious point.
I think that is essential.
The Mafia does exist!

The end does not justify the means.
None of this of new.
There is a question of extradition.
Let us not forget that.
That is not organized crime.
What do I mean by that?
And they do just that.
They have been doing it for years.
That is a contradiction.
Commerce does not want any limitations.
We must not allow this.
People knew who the drug-pushers were.
I hope it is of help to you.
There are only a few points.
Two more remarks.
Links between these two exist.
Why is this so?
I do not want to be misunderstood.
We need workable solutions to this.
Workable solutions must be found.
They are therefore included.
But the objective is there.
The debate is closed.
We have certainly appreciated that.
Why not, indeed?

Or that is how I interpret it.
They can already do that.
These do not exist here.
Absolutely.

This is an important step forward.
This work has already begun.
This has two important consequences.
Thank you, Madam Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Votes

It is therefore a general precaution.
It concerns budgetary specifications.
I urge that this be approved.
Thank you, Mr Willockx.
So I will put it to Parliament.
(Parliament adopted the amendments)
Yes, Madam President.
I think that clarifies things.
There is a reason for this.
That is an impossible procedure.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Schulz.
Secchi report (A4-0344/97)

W.G. van Velzen report (A4-0346/97)
Cederschi√∂ld report(A4-0333/97)
In the plan, this choice is not made.
This is also where the problem lies.
This is a step in the right direction.
A corrupt Europe has no future.
We must act now.
Orlando report(A4-0355/97)
Orlando report(A4-0349/97)
Nassauer report(A4-0367/97)
Situation in Iraq
Secondly, the humanitarian aspect.
This has surely always been possible.
An empty slogan, perhaps.
And if not, why not?
Enough is enough.
That is undoubtedly true.
In itself this is very significant.
On the subject of humanitarian aid.
The debate is closed.
Topical and urgent debate
What is a war criminal?
What is an internal armed conflict?
Up to this point I am for.
What is a war crime?
Will the court rule in such cases?
Secondly, the duty of giving evidence.
All the same I have some questions.
Will the veto disappear?
How does it work?
The debate is closed.
What is to be done?
So we went to Lom√© for a week.
He recommends that we read it.
There are none.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Voting will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Protection of Children's Rights
This is completely unacceptable!
The Press in Slovakia
Thank you very much Madam President.
Agrarian reform in the Philippines
There are also reports of torture.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Malaysia
Chittagong Hill Tracts
Thousands still languish in camps.
We recognize this problem.
Silvia Baraldini

At any rate, I heard nothing.
Thank you very much Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5 p.m.
Spain
The Azores
Portugal
Common sense and goodwill are VITAL!
Spain/Portugal/The Azores
What can be more important than that?
It was an involuntary omission.
Votes
One thing leads to the other.
I cannot back this.
This was not the case.
Langen report (A4-0350/97)
That concludes the votes .
Political action is urgently required.

It is good, given improved cooperation.
This is something we can fully support.
This strikes me as extremely important.
And so it should be.
The same applies to immigration policy.
But that is not true.
In the long term that cannot function.
Spain really does border on Russia.
The debate is closed.
Future of the ESF
That is very important.



In any case not in this case.
Madam President.
Then a second point of communality.
There is a double challenge.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.45 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
I reported this at the front.
Very well, Mr Posselt.
The correction will be made.
It quite clearly said 'British beef' .
Sessional services can confirm that.
(The Minutes were approved)
Votes
But we have to go along with it.
It has happened.
Yes, you are quite right.
Mr Holm and Mr Wibe are here.
Everybody is here.
That's excellent!
Wheeled vehicles

The plan was successful.
Mr Bangemann keeps his promises!
That is why we support this report.
The debate is closed.
(Parliament adopted the decision)
Everyone can think of examples.
Europe must fulfil its commitments.
Cinema and audiovisual productions
This is a real issue of civilization.
Let me explain.
Several speakers have mentioned them.
It is a major growth market.
This has to be tackled.
I want to say why.
I reject that entirely.
How would you assess the situation?
I understand Mr Elchlepp's concern.
The joint debate is closed.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Antarctic fisheries
There are few controls even inside.
There needs to be satellite control.
This is a very serious question.
I will go through the points in order.
Thank you for your speech, Mrs Bonino.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
In my view that is unacceptable!
But paper is patient.
But something has to happen!
That will hurt!
We have to avoid it at all costs!
Thank you, Mrs Bonino.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Medina Ortega report (A4-0365/97)
Kindermann report (A4-0364/97)
Novo report (A4-0363/97)
We did not support the report.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 11.46 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Welcome
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
Very well, Mr Bazin.
(Parliament approved the request)
Enlargement - Agenda 2000
Some might develop faster than others.
It will take a long time.
Reference has been made to the cost.
(Applause)
We fully support this idea.
This is composed of three parts.
It is a much wider process.
The people need encouragement.


We, the Members, must be the advocate.
We must open up this Parliament!
(Applause)
That is dangerous.
Let us seize them.
Agenda 2000 lags far behind that.
No.
It says so quite explicitly.
All three are small countries.
I believe that is only too justified.
None of them were elected.
Thank you!
Well, Latvia is doing all that.
That is what I want too.
Poland must and will modernize.
The Commission has done its job.
Slovakia is important enough in itself.
There has been a great deal of contact.
Today we confirm this position.
Cyprus is a special case.
The reply is probably yes.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Fine, I would say.
This is included in the resolution.
This wording is too vague.
That way we shall have gained nothing.
That is a bit self-contradictory.
Who is furthest ahead?
This is totally unacceptable.
The Commission's proposal lacks logic.
I thank them for this initiative.
It is to be applauded.
We do not hold that against it.
They could be confirmed.
That is not our purpose either.
I have gone over my speaking time.
I will very rapidly conclude therefore.
So, are we reforming in all directions?
That would be a bad calculation.
That is a tall order.
It will not be easy.
That is quite a lot to take on.
It is a flexible process.
This is our historic mission.
You talk of respect for minorities.
A bitter joke!
That is quite right and proper.
Well, that is politics.
We must find those answers, I tell you!
We do not talk about that!
All that is true.
I did not see them there!
Our situation is much more difficult.
Here we must be alert.
That is to miss the point entirely.
Thank you, Mr Spencer.
For my group, it is Mr Blokland.
Thank you, Mr Commissioner.
Is there going to be more of that?
That is what is being decided now.
Are the people or the elite to decide?
It should be seen for what it is.
The process will go far smoother.
There is no walking away from them.
No cost analysis has been carried out.
We must not force the pace.
For that, two conditions are necessary.
We had to pay for it.
Let us make no mistake.
I am an Austrian member.
I want to stay with that image.
That is all very marvellous!
This is a madman's debate!
It is full of lies and deception!
Certainly not in reality!
I want enlargement!
Free elections must be organized.
I wanted to raise that in this context.
They either are or are not.
Hence my warning.
We must all do our homework.
That must not happen!
That too must not happen.
We must not repeat this mistake.
Where is their vision?
I take Poland as an example.
It is a country with borders.
We can see the reasoning behind this.
We have to move to EMU.
The shortfall is huge.
Is this what we really want?
Security? Human rights?
We hope so.
That is what is happening, though.
These are young, fragile democracies.
This is a chance we must take!
That is a very important aspect.
Thank you very much Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)
You are a member of that committee.
This is not an issue to consider today.
I am asking for a statement.
It cannot do so immediately.
I appreciate that the protesters...
Votes
It therefore contains no ambiguities.
And here comes the other part:
Thank you very much, Mr Oostlander.
On Amendment No 114
That is the issue.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I do not know.
On paragraph 15
You have the floor, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy.
It was on paragraph 15.
In that case, we vote for.
That is quite normal.
We then voted against Amendment No 21.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
We must not be remembered for that.
Europe must be open to everyone.
Therefore we have put on blinkers.
Several risks are already apparent.
What will happen when we are twenty?
Europe must not abandon this challenge.
May it do so again, and frequently!
What business is it of ours?
What are these artifices?
I am very much afraid they have not.
Colom i Naval report (A4-0331/97)
First, on the single currency.
Where does the solution lie?
In our opinion, in postponing the euro.
What do we find?
Third stage of EMU
We have largely ignored this question.
This is intolerable and unacceptable.
Everyone agrees on that.
They are not to be confused with them.
A lot is indeed happening.
That is just one side of the matter.
Such a process takes a long time.
That is indispensable.
That is no semantic change.
We must go further.
But where are the real answers?
Now, the danger for EMU is certain.
To what level?
That is not my style.
Right.
The debate is closed.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
1.The report is unrealistic.
Structural measures in Belgium
I would like to take up three points.
The rapporteur has just done this.
This is an absolute scandal.
We must also create the pre-conditions.
I shall explain this statement.
No more passing the buck.
We are all in the same boat.
But that is not an all-clear signal!
This of course also applies to Belgium.
Thank you, Madam Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now move to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That completes Parliament's agenda.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 1.25 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mr Medina.
Thank you, Mr Papakyriazis.
Allow me to correct myself.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I was going to make the same point.
There will be no resolution or vote.
You were there as I was.
Please pass this on to all concerned.
Thank you, Mr Provan.
It had still not received this letter.
So I have signed it.
(The Minutes were approved)
Order of business
There is no problem.
The request can therefore be granted.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Anybody against?
No?
Then we shall proceed to the vote.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
That is a fact and not an estimation.
There it is only one in ten employees.
However, there is also a danger.
What the Commission says is positive.
We must get the balance right.
Who takes part in the negotiations?
Who takes part in the partnership?
What does organization of work mean?
There are plenty of examples of this.
Then we move on to training.
What I miss, though, is an action plan.
Don't you think so?
And how!
The debate is closed.
Two examples were reported last month.


Secondly, the complexity.
Otherwise it is not worth a penny.
Women's rights are human rights.
Trafficking in women is degrading.
Thank you very much.
We must have their support.
Is it not time to put things straight?
I go along with that.
The debate is closed.
Even the public gallery is emptying.
They are all going away!
The debate is closed.
We do not favour this.
The debate is closed.
Postal Services
The other questioners did not do that.
That is the problem in a nutshell.
That is the point exactly.
Hence, I welcome the questions.
Now to Mrs Moreau.
Yes, I will come to you as well!
This is not the case.
I am the eternal scapegoat.
Then the principles are described.
This is not clear to me in your reply.
I am unable to do so.
The debate is closed.
The Commission has approved this, too.
This has been our objective.
I thought I had two minutes. I do not?
I will conclude then.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.15 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved) .
Are there any other comments?
I do not understand.
Why is Mr H√§nsch the problem?
I really do not understand.
I think that is the least I can do.
I would like an answer on this.
Our constituents demand it.
That is why I have not had a reply.
Draft budget for 1998

But how does it look in concrete terms?
This is a success of our negotiations.
The procedure provides for this.
We know the outcome.
That is a very satisfactory outcome.
A fine thing!
That decision is inappropriate.
I am glad to say that still applies.
We considered this essential.
One thing became clear.
Clearly it is not very much.
We still need to debate this, however.
I hope that can be rectified.
We offer them our warmest thanks.
The 1998 budget is a rigorous one.
Such a contribution can be conceived.
The budget has not been easy.
But that must not be forgotten.
It cannot become the norm.
That can only benefit everybody.
Secondly, there is budgetary rigour.
The last is Parliament's role.
Mr President, you referred to that.
I would cite four which come to mind.
One final thing about Mr Giansily.
Then we will decide.
We cannot vote for this proposal.
What did we expect from this budget?
We achieved this as well.
These are institutional elements.
Everyone else is above it.
Do you know what ECU 7 is?
This is a hefty reduction.
I shall end there, Mr President.
He is to be commended.
The state cannot do it.
This budget also supports employment.
However, we should not exaggerate.
We have managed a balanced budget.
We have affirmed our prerogatives.
We have expressed our priorities.
And if so, this is due to many people.
A word on the ECSC.
That worries me.
The debate is closed.
That is a good procedure.
I will just mention one.
(Applause)
We were not successful.
But this is not enough.
I could cite still further examples.
Thank you, Commissioner Gradin.
The debate is adjourned to 3 p.m.
Welcome
Thank you very much for coming!
Votes
Raw tobacco (A4-414/97)
Fraud is also commonplace.
Andersson report (A4-313/97)
Nonetheless, I voted for the report.
Waddington report (A4-372/97)
However much more needs to be done.
The penalty must fit the crime.
That is not good for the debate.
No-one ever listens.
Thank you!
Mr President, just one sentence.
Thank you, Mrs Reding.
Concrete proposals exist.
There is no doubt about that.
And it deserves our gratitude!
This should be said loud and clear.
So it is all going too slowly.
This is necessary.
There is enough to do.
This is a requirement for efficiency.
I am not familiar with this term.
I want to refer to three points.
We need to look closely at this area.
Finally, there is the role of Europol.
The debate is closed.
Fifth R & D framework programme
Otherwise, we cannot meet the deadline.
So the timetable is agreed.
We will try to make it all go smoothly.
This cannot be gratifying to us.
My amendments serve this aim.
This is not a slip semantically.
It is really how we use the research.
We need to pay more attention to that.
Small companies have a difficulty.
They have not got the resources.
Where it is consistent, we support it.
It is very close to our pain threshold.
This was a mistake.
The Euratom treaty was successful.
She has worked hard.
For this, much thanks.
You are to be commended for that.
Why?
The Chinese did not want to.
That is what it is all about.
At least I would like to think so.
We must increase safety.
What has happened?
All this has vanished.
Obviously, this is a new baby.
There were problems.
What is it all about?
First, structure.
Now, content.
The Council must now give its opinion.
The debate is closed.
Energy policy
Question Time (Commission)
It is not our responsibility.
Let me just take up one more question.
Is the Commissioner aware of this?
It should not happen that way.
It is an interesting point.
Subject: Toy safety
I thank the Commissioner for his reply.
The floor is yours.
I appreciate your point, Mr President.
There must be no misunderstanding.
I wonder if you have gone far enough.
We have given them further information.
This was successful.
They will no longer exist.
My question was by no means answered.
There is no problem in that.
I believe that everyone will gain.
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
I would like to express my reget.

Thank you, Mr Waidelich.
I am also interested in this question.
I have a supplementary question.
This seems to be mostly about roads.
I am grateful to the honourable Member.
I would recommend that he do so.
That is what is at stake.
One thing to conclude, Mr President.
That concludes Question Time.
We intend exactly the opposite.
Neither of these claims is correct.
Allow me to make a few comments.
Will you include the spine?
No-one has yet managed to tell them.
That should be resisted.
I hope it can be retrieved.
What is to be done?
This is what the farmers are asking.
It could have declared risks.
This is an option.
That should be put on record.
The unfair competition must end.
We held a committee of inquiry.
Its chairman is here.
Its rapporteur is also here.
That cannot be right.
This is our objective.
Is it within the next month?
Is that true?
Mr Fischler will certainly do the same.
There are still needs now.
Because we want it to be watertight.
That is not an import ban.
In fact that has been our approach.
Thank you!
And suddenly you do not like that.
The Council rejected the proposal.
Another scientific opinion followed.
It was supported by five countries.
That is the situation.
The debate is closed.
I am sorry but we are over time.
Energy policy (continuation)
(The President cut off the speaker)
The Commission has to look wider too.
It is essential that these are done.
We always talk about renewable energy.
We have none of that.
This is not the answer.
It is a very sensible communication.
The debate is closed.
Aid to shipbuilding
We agree.
Those are the first two principles.
Their chances would be reduced.
It is quite simply unacceptable.
That is no longer so.
You may think what you like about them.
The debate is closed.
Services of general interest in Europe
My research confirms that.
I thank colleagues for that.
I hope that we can do it.
They are there for the public.
First example: air traffic control.
Mine seemed to deteriorate.
So again, heartfelt best wishes!
Communication is an element in this.
That we accept.
She has done some very good work.
What matters is the service itself.
Why?
We lose it at our peril.
That is where it leads.
But what have we seen?
It is free to air.
What was the competitive value of that?
Water is obviously a public service.
And that is the basis of democracy.
I think, as little as possible.
Thank you, Mr van Miert.
Mr Desama, the floor is yours.
Obviously we are prepared to do so.
This is how we have to work together.
The debate is closed.
Denominations in euros
What could we have done?
Why do I repeat that again?
The scenario is clear.
We are not suffering from gold fever.
We have emphasized that many times.
This is an unacceptable situation.
This could cause confusion.
Will there be a competition?
Indeed, this is an important question.
I think that would be heavily symbolic.
I really cannot understand that.
Yes or no?
That is the principle adopted.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.11 a.m.)
The next item is the joint debate on:
It is a fact acquired through history.
Today it is a fait accompli.
(Applause)
Why?
What are we asking in exchange?
I think not.
(Loud applause)
Their motivation has been exemplary.
Some thought even too generous.
We must discuss them!
(Applause)
But we are also worried.
I wish them lots of luck!
But let us not be under any illusions.
This is not a club for Christians.
I congratulate you on this.
Let us take note of these promises.
That applies to the enlargement.
I will make four comments.
I am not satisfied about Turkey.
It dates back to the 1960s.
Our battle is only just beginning.


All of these were positive measures.
This is surely the way forward.
To each and every one, a big thank you.
That should have been said clearly.
Everything else is diplomatic eyewash.
Turkey has been waiting for 34 years.
Consistent?
Why is NATO membership not suspended?
What is the difference?
We can go through the "acquis' .
It would also be to our own advantage.
The greatest reforms are yet to come.
The debate will continu at 3 p.m.
Votes
Quisthoudt-Rowohl Report (A4-0395/97)
This is wrong.
Why is this not used?
Sindal Report (A4-377/97)
Postal services
This is why we reject it.
Billingham Report (A4-0357/97)
We can but congratulate them for this.
Let us not forget this historic lesson.
I would like to thank Mr Fayot.
(Applause)
Well done, we are proud of you!
Mr Juncker, you are right.
But that has consequences.
We should not fool ourselves.
Very much remains to be done, too much.
That is how serious it is.
That also applies to Yugoslavia.
We are a small country like Luxembourg.
That rather expresses my feeling.
I do not reproach him for this.
I will return to this topic.
What does this mean for the future?
It think that is simply ridiculous.
As far as that is concerned, my thanks.
Subsidiarity was ensured.
Congratulations, Jean-Claude Juncker!
We really need concentration here.
This is an important process.
Mr President, I will be brief.
I have three small points.
Firstly, Turkey.
I find this curious.
I understand the groups' problem.
Does this mean we are satisfied?
It must be objectified.
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
The debate is closed.
I do not think so.






Is this delay justified?
I am about to finish.
It does not respect its own programme.
You have replied to this criticism.
Reflection is also a slow process.
Let me give you a personal example.
We are at the end of 1997.
That is a political fact.
Finally, a word on taxation.
That was one point.
The Commission proposed it.
Fourthly, the Middle East.
And finally, the Balkans.
A difficult question.
We said no.
I am not prepared to accept that.
I always think reflection is excellent.
In no way, Mr Oreja!
Who controls these organizations?
The Commission took initiatives.
You are absolutely right.
The Delors Commission was about to end.
We did not know what to do.
It is a very serious problem.
My comment is this.
So I have made a note of your concern.
There were a lot of other speeches.
It is one of the results of Amsterdam.
No, let us do it now.
Let us attempt to go further.
We are going to try to do so.
It is never completely satisfactory.
It is not in my hands.
Question Time (Council)
The vote was then postponed.
Thank you, Mr Sj√∂stedt.

What might the timetable for this be?
Subject: Agri-tourism
Yes!
We need discussions, not threats.
Subject: Electoral law in Gibraltar
I think this was clever advice!
Subject: European Food Agency
Thank you, Mr Posselt.
Subject: Autonomous status for Kosovo
The same obviously applies to autonomy.
A lesson must now be learned from this.
They are available to Parliament.
Subject: Protest march in Brussels
He refers to the single market.
That assurance was given in 1991.
That concludes Question Time.
We welcome these amendments.
These we oppose.
Thank you, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
Olives and olive oil
This is not the case.
We therefore call upon common sense.

The options are clear.
Something is not right.
We have our small producers.
We have our three million olive trees.
Oil has a great history.
There are technical solutions.
Fraud has been mentioned.
You will be invited again.
You will be made to eat a sweet onion.
I would like to emphasize three points.
Anything can happen in this world.
This is a disgrace!


Therefore, I congratulate you.
This is a serious failing.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Combatting tobacco consumption
It seems there is proof of this.
It is really scandalous.
I shall be taking part in that debate.
I would like to see us working on that.
The idea is ridiculous!
Nothing is therefore established..
The rapporteur knows this.
Anyway, it is their choice.
I am against this request.
Not so!
However, I have some observations.
It is really scandalous.
No, I am sorry, I am not having that.
Please sit down again.
We can then sort this out, please!
You have now done just that.
Mr Blak has asked for the floor.
We will now continue the debate.
Please continue.
Public health cannot be negotiated.
It is an excellent report.
Thank you, Mrs Thyssen.
But I forgive him.
We will not discuss this.
I was not brought up to be a thief.
There has been a physical onslaught.
Why does nobody talk about alcoholism?
So what are we do to about it?
I believe that is the main question.
But how can we protect our children?
Is an advertising ban the answer?
But this product is actually a drug!
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Humane trapping
I urge support for the Pimenta report.
So no good will come of it.
We started it as far back as in 1991.
We must vote against this.
That is the essential task facing us.
Is this true?
Therefore this is an effective measure.
It does not go the whole way.
Only the agreement can do that.
The debate is closed.
Foodstuffs
I agree with that entirely.
Something should be done about this.
It is all a question of semantics.
There is a lot of money at stake.
This is absolute rubbish.
But that does not mean pesticide-free.
My last point is on sports foods.
We said so at the time.
The debate is closed.
However, there are also a few problems.
So NGOs should be supported.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.36 a.m.)
Statement by the President
Mr Rosado Fernandes.
Mr Giansily.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr Puerta has asked to speak.
Mr Puerta.
Mr Lataillade.
Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you, Mr Lataillade.
Votes
This is only one reference.
Thank you very much, Mr Fischbach.
I invite you to speak.
This is in fact a good budget.
My sincere thanks to you all.
The rest remains the same.
We are against this deletion.
Thank you.
In relation to amendment No 122
I only say this by way of explanation.
I will try to ensure that you do.
After the vote on Amendment No 2
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
After the vote on paragraph 7.2
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
However, this is not enough.
We have voted no to the report.
That is a shame.
Well, that really is the limit!
These industries are in trouble.
Sandb√¶k recommendation (A4-0379/97)
Paasio recommendation (A4-0371/97)
Giansily Report (A4-0409/97)
Pimenta Report (A4-0325/97)
Scapagnini Report (A4-0308/97)
I disagree totally.
European Council
What does the treaty say?
So, what is the solution?
Turkey is not one of those countries.

Commission programme

But that question has not been raised.
Jov√© Peres report
Let's join the real world.
What is the purpose of this report?
These are the points in question:
Valverde L√≥pez report (A4-0341/97)
Now for everything else.
I was unable to support Paragraph 20.
Where is the consistency?
Thank you, Mr Papakyriazis.
It is something outside my experience.
Outcome of the Kyoto Conference
This leads me to my last point.
What will our next steps be?
We have no time to waste.
COP4 is of major importance.
Kyoto provided the platform.
But it was a first step.
In Kyoto we were completely fragmented.
We saw this very clearly in Kyoto.
Madam President, this is a disgrace!
What is the result?
Opinions vary.
They lack material and human resources.
Their legitimacy is weak.
This is not a sacrifice.
Nuclear energy is not the answer.
You cannot.
Now let us think about 1997.
The time has come now for that idea.
We are doing an own-initiative report.
(Applause )
Thank you, Madam Commissioner.
Topical and urgent debate
The real work is starting.
The implementation is important.
We have seen a lot of progress made.
All of this is very encouraging.
Thank you.
A ban is not enough, however.
The EU can assist greatly in such work.
Namely, the Finnish government.
Of course, the process is not yet over.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
This has to be stated.
They come from everywhere.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Nigeria
So what is to be done now?
There is some slight gleam of hope.
Let me tell you something about him.
It is a sad situation.
Sierra Leone
And how could this be done?
We support these warmly.
Croatia
So this possibility is very real.
Because that is the crux of the issue.
It wants to retain its NGO status.
A positive bit of news we might say.
Journalists are taken to court.
Albania
I regret this very much.
I think it is a great pity.
Djibouti
The joint debate is closed
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Human rights and democratization
The next item is the joint debate on:


So far, so good.
On this point we all totally agreed.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This is a good thing.
I believe that this is very important.
Please do not misunderstand me.
The mystery, I fear, remains.
The reasons are various.
Of course there are sometimes.
Thank you, Commissioner Brittan.
No.
The joint debate is closed.
Benchmarking
Paragraph 10 gives an example of this.
The debate is closed.
Expenditure on CFSP
What is the point of all this?
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 19: 55)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Votes
It is approved.
There are none.
(Parliament adopted the proposal)
And this is true of the present report.
The answer, in my opinion, is no.
But that is not the end of the matter.
Lack of transparency.

What is happening about baby food?
I was amazed.
I do not quite understand that.


Best wishes!
Hence the debate this morning.
Labelling is extremely important.
Not a bit of it!
And it gets worse.
So why was that not possible?
None at all.
We all agree on this, certainly.
And what of the scientists?
Not a word has been said about this!
I would like to know the exact figure!
I think this is essential.
History proves that.
It could not be clearer.
So this debate is far from over.
The joint debate is now closed.
Interim agreement with Uzbekistan
It may take a long time.
There is one stumbling block, however.
The same applies to Christians.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
These prisoners run greater risks.
Thank you, Mrs van Bladel.
UEFA decisions on Coca-Cola Cup winners
It is vital and crucial to them.
Football is in Europe.
Football is big business.
So it is a serious matter for them.
That is what we must focus on.

Thank you very much, Mrs Cresson.
The debate is closed.
Adjournment of the session
Thank you very much, Mrs Lulling.
(The sitting was closed at 11.41 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you, Mr Wynn.
Order of business
(The order of business was adopted)
To me this seems absolutely absurd.
Let us be under no illusion here.
So what are the solutions?

We cannot agree to this.
This development must be reversed.
Roads are simply getting full up.
But we have to bear in mind two issues.
But Commissioner Kinnock is right.
However, noblesse oblige .
Ireland's urban transport is in chaos.
Gridlock is the order of the day.
We must prioritize railway investment.
That includes railways.
This does not seem realistic to us.
I want a clear direction.
Or will we place tolls on the railways?
Policy needs to be changed.
Who is going to run the railways?
This is a very important point.
That is a tragic truth.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The debate is closed.
Operation of aeroplanes
The debate is closed.
Industrial competitiveness
One example is satellite navigation.
And the role of the Commission?
That point is quite clearly made.
It will inspire you.
We can be absolutely sure of that.
How big should our factories be?
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
New Rule 79a of the Rules of Procedure
Thank you, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy.
Madam President, I will be brief.
I congratulate Mr Fayot on his report.
It is short, sharp and to the point.
What does the Treaty stipulate?
I regret this.

Technical arguments do not exist.
They want to gag Parliament.
The debate is closed.
That will no longer be possible.
They were a significant step forward.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.05 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
I have made a note of your comments.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
You have to adapt to survive.

So much the better!
This may have a stabilizing effect.
What kind of suggestion is that?
Do we need regional observatories?
Just one rate!
Our people have concerns.
It will also help cross-border sales.
I regard this as a matter of dignity.
Formal Treaty criteria are met.
Faith in the euro will be tested.
Will the euro answer this question?
I think not.
Will it be?
Secondly, democracy is being eroded.
Three years is really too long.

That is a priority.
It gave her 9, 600 lire.
Why is it that only bad news is news?
We need the confidence of the people.
Only 7 % have begun preparations.
Indeed, the euro is coming.



Discussions are continuing.
I would like to respond to Mrs Thyssen.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Votes
Friedrich Report(A4-0383/97)
This is a decision which we support.
No such thing!
That is the real question.
Ruffolo Report (A4-0338/97)
Stevens Report (A4-0417/97)
Europe has a great deal going for it.
There is worse to come.
P√©rez Royo Report (A4-0415/97)
We must rectify this immediately.
That concludes voting time.
Transatlantic relations
Here are some observations.
Hue now goes to Washington.
What are we to do?
Certainly not.
Just try converting that into jobs!
At times it is rather difficult.
We then have the creation of the euro.
This relationship can be developed.
I am in favour of Atlanticism.
All these are difficult questions.
I would say that they are very high.
Lastly, where do we head to next?
The debate is closed.
Foodstuffs


These are the two main amendments.

Food is not such a simple matter.
We now come to the proposal on honey.
We are looking into this at the moment.
Except that our hands are tied here.
My hands are tied.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)

Subject: Single market
Subject: Blood transfusions
This then is my fear.
That has happened.
It sets an objective.
No, I do not think so.
Subject: EMU
But these are only examples.
Well, what does Article 2 say?
Growth cannot be decreed.
That cannot be ignored.
Now the framework must be fleshed out.
We need to persevere down this road.
Thank you, Mr de Silguy.
That is where music comes in.
It was a great success.
This is very important for the future!
The system comprises three phases:
That is its own decision.
That is perfectly acceptable.
Whom should we consult?
I have a very brief question.
Think of the Derby for instance.
I shall be very brief.
I thank the Commissioner for his reply.
I am therefore grateful for the reply.
Subject: The situation in Burma
The situation in Burma is very serious.
The answer is obvious.
Subject: Human rights in Colombia
Subject: Human rights in Colombia
Subject: Human rights in Colombia
Thank you for your reply.
We can be grateful for that.
No, no, my position is still the same.
I said as much in Bogot√°.
Everybody is responsible.
You did not respond to either.
I get the impression you do not know.
That concludes Question Time.
Emissions from organic compounds
What causes these ozone peaks?
Where do these emissions come from?
How can this be achieved?
It deserves close attention.
Such substances are used a great deal.
I would like to give a figure.
Is that true?
That is why we amended this directive.
They are Amendments Nos 10 and 14.
Thank you, Commissioner Bjerregaard.
The debate is closed.
Epidemiological surveillance
But microbes do not care about borders.
That is very little.
It really is not good enough.
Where were we?
We were in a muddle!
We were in a mess!
What if we do nothing?
It is called influenza AH5N1.
Thank you, Commissioner Flynn.
The debate is closed.
Biocidal products
Thank you, Commissioner Bjerregaard.
The debate is closed.
Cohesion and the information society
Let us be realistic.
Why am I saying all this?
So what do I believe?
Thank you, Commissioner Wulf-Mathies.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.00 pm.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
However, we shall look into the matter.
(The Minutes were approved)
Membership of political groups
Thank you very much, Mr Kerr.
The Minutes will be corrected.
Topical and urgent debate (objections)
Mr Cook has the floor.
It is a hard act to follow.
I understand why they do that.
After all, it is always true.
These are momentous projects.
We have done that.
We have got rid of the Iron Curtain.
I know they are your priorities.
They will also be ours.
First, employment.
Five million of them are under 25.
Let us ensure it is a positive one.
Jobs, crime and the environment.
But there is much we can agree on.
We want to find out how we can help.
I know you will give us that help.
(Loud applause)
Mrs Green now has the floor.
We wish it well.
(Applause)
Anyhow: welcome back, England.
But a warning is called for.
Good intentions are not enough.
A presidency has to show results.
Two comments about the Balkans.
But we need more than that.
What are our suggestions?
That is what rock-'n'-roll is for me.
Europe is sick.
Europe is sick.
People who are made social outcasts.
Those people need more than words.
That is not enough for those people!
People do not live on money alone.
They need work so they can earn money.
For Europe as well as at home.
You cannot always get what you want.
We can work it out, we can work it out!
That to me is a lost opportunity.
This is the fundamental question.
(Applause )
It leaves no time for consideration.
But then what?
It means ending unfair state aids.
Agenda 2000 is a good starting-point.
It is a historic challenge.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Finally, about decentralization.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Why?
Our voters are wondering.
It has nothing under control!
We must not be indifferent to that!
I want to be sincere in what I say!
This is an undeniable fact.
That is what is needed.




That is true.
You say you want an efficient Europe.
So does this Parliament.
That is true, and we want it too.
We agree.
There is nothing to object to in that.
You are right.
It is not true, anyway.
Europe is much more than a market.
And that is not all.
First point, Algeria.
Second point, the Asian crisis.
When will I get a reply?
Fourth point, Turkey.
Nobody is complaining.
Clearly it cannot be done.
We have two options.
Would the groups agree to that?
On the contrary!

(The President cut off the speaker)
I have ten minutes.
But it has to be the starting point.
I hope that mission will go soon.
I close with one last national thought.
(Loud and sustained applause)
The debate is closed.
Votes
on the Ford report (A4-0400/97)
on the Lambraki report (A4-0001/98)
on the Filippi report (A4-0002/98)
on the Chesa report (A4-0003/98)
It can be moved, changed or return etc.
on the Cabrol report (A4-0406/97)
(Interruption by the President)
I am not taking advantage.
Unfortunately.
They can kill bees.
UEFA Resolution and Coca-Cola Cup
Why?
on the Souchet report (A4-0410/97)
They expect us to do the same.
That concludes Voting Time.
Continuing training
Society is changing ever more rapidly.
That is the most important issue.
That is one factor.
There are clear connections.
Allow me to point out a danger.
We are talking about employability .
This is worth bearing in mind.
What kind of market economy do we have?
What market economy do we want?
That is what present-day needs impose.
Thank you, Commissioner Cresson.
The debate is closed.
Participation in profits (PEPPER II)
Why are the employers satisfied?
Why the workers?
Many congratulations!
But we want to see action!
These cooperatives therefore work well.
Most of them can be developed.
That is hardly mentioned in the report.
Mr President, what follows from this?
Grand intentions are no longer enough!
Thank you Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Kurdish refugees
But this in itself will not be enough.
This is not acceptable.
We must be patient.
Fourthly: the burdens.
(Applause)
The assessment is clear.
This arrangement is inappropriate.
That is the first demand.
But at first, nobody cared.
Now, of course, things have changed.
You can understand my Greek?
OK.
To continue, then.
There are, however, no such proposals.
I await Mr Henderson's answer.
No!
We do not have to!
Therefore I hold a different opinion.
Do you know what?
With Bosnia it was in a direct sense.
Thank you, Mr Henderson.
A brief comment from Mrs Aelvoet.
Thank you.
We exclude nothing.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
Subject: Belarus
I hope that they can help.

Mr Hern√°ndez Mollar has the floor.
Thank you, Mr Hern√°ndez Mollar.
Greece has twelve delegates.
Subject: Human Rights in Cuba
I welcome the President-in-Office.
Firstly, South African fishing.
I hope that this will be respected.
Thank you very much for your answer.
This just has not happened.
But it said a lot about Cyprus.
Subject: Eurodac Convention
There are sometimes slip-ups.
Thank you very much, Mr Henderson.
That concludes Question Time.
Well, this has now been done.
This is now common knowledge.
After all, cars do not buy cars.
But let me just make two points.

There are frequent cases of this.
That is what is important.
I would refer to two points.
First, the code of conduct.
I have two further points to make.
One concerns the exchange rate.
The debate is closed.



They seem to be common-sense measures.
But to do this we obviously need money.
A report on coastal areas is to follow.


So what he said is only half the truth.
This is the right path.
The debate is closed.
VAT on telecommunications
It is also one of the most complex.
How should it be enforced?
Where should it be enforced?
Should there be a specific tax?
This we all have a duty to put right.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.07 p.m.)
Drugs
Over the Christmas break...
(Applause)
There is not.
Against?
This fact should not be concealed.
It is the work of Tony Blair.
No one wanted to do so.
I can see Mr Dell'Alba.
All right?
So, you have spoken on her behalf.
That is right, is it not?
Fingerprinting asylum seekers (Eurodac)
I will explain why.
Well, I certainly have mixed feelings.
That is also a good thing.
Asylum is a basic human right.
That is a fundamental point.
I believe this is not really necessary.
I would like to finish the quotation.
I think that is important.
So it is a good tool.
We have to do something about it.
It is possible, in theory.
We do not have one.
And even then you don't need Eurodac!
Thank you, Commissioner Gradin.
The debate is closed.
Green Paper on the statutory auditor
That should be made perfectly clear.
Indeed it has been put into practice.
This is a problem.
How can we tackle this?
We do not want accumulation.
Let me pick out some points of view.
Thank you, Commissioner Gradin.
The debate is closed.
Alpine transit
That is to be welcomed.
We need an agreement.
The Swiss can hide behind the Alps.
Do whatever you want in France.
We want to protect the environment.
That is still unacceptable.
We must tell the Swiss this.
We can't work together on that basis.
My response is No!
The Swiss had promised this.
However, there are solutions.
Thank you, Mrs Leperre-Verrier.
Thank you, Mr Jarzembowski.
Naturally, there is an objection.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Thank you, Mr Tomlinson.
Votes
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
d'Ancona report (A4-0402/97)
Erika Mann report (A4-0403/97)
Sierra Gonz√°lez report (A4-0399/97)
That is what is happening in my region.
Waddington report (A4-0405/97)
I hope the Commission will reply.
Disappointments are in store for us.
Hermange report (A4-0292/97)
We voted against this resolution.

It will happen again now.
We find this extremely sad.
Sainjon report (A4-0392/97)
That is in fact one way to proceed.
Such relocations often destroy jobs.

(The President cut off the speaker)
Alpine transit (continuation)
Mr Ferber has now left the room.
There's no way around it.
No way to make progress.
The debate is closed.
Community aid
This should therefore be put right.
If so, what is it?
There are six of these.
We are not yet ready to do so.
That was the first point.
I hope Europe will not fall behind.
Topical and urgent debate
This promise has been fulfilled.
The Home Affairs Minister has resigned.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Thank you, Mr President.
This is serious.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Human cloning
It is always the same old story.
And that is the real danger.
That is unacceptable.
Humanity needs scientific progress.
But what is human cloning?
We must be very clear here.
We have certainly tried.
Will it be available for all?
Will special permits be needed?
In actual fact, it adds nothing.
This also applies here.
I recognize God as the Creator of man.
It is vital.
I emphasize "human being' .
That is my first point.
We must be quite clear.
Ingusci
He understands the situation perfectly.
It is very difficult situation.
We must envisage solutions urgently.
Democratic Republic of Congo
(The president cut off the speaker)
Indigenous peoples of Australia
I wish to support that proposition.
So this is a very timely resolution.
Executions
Tibet
It will attempt to make a contribution.
Now to China and Tibet.
This in itself is positive.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Mr President, it makes on think.
Thank you, Mr Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Community aid (continuation)
I support this.
My group fully supports this report.
It is no such thing.
And he gave me an example.
They do have vested interests.
It would be far better spent.
Aid should not be parachuted in.
It is true.
We can complain about this.
There it is again.
This is indeed a separate story.
Which reminds me.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.15 p.m.) .
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mrs Hardstaff.
You are right.
Mr President, that also applies to me.
Thank you very much, Mr Pasty.
(The Minutes were approved)
Votes
It strikes me as superfluous.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Goerens report (A4-0388/97)
Mr Goerens' report is good.
I approve of its main outline.
What is the reality behind this?
That is regrettable.
Many happy returns, Mr Telk√§mper.

Dire poverty paralyses all development.
This agreement has favourable elements.
Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution.)
However, debt relief is not enough.
Fisheries relations with Latvia
Now it is Latvia's turn.
Latvia has a relatively small fleet.
In Germany we say Friday is fish day.
What has changed today?
I am disappointed about that.
That is not right.
Why not?
Just look at today's report.
How can I convince you of that?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mountain regions and Structural Funds
A change of direction is visible here.
Not so!
It needs to be maintained.
It is a fragile heritage.
That is fine as far as it goes.
But as far as it goes is not enough.
We do not believe in that model.
This is very important.
This is not least what tourism means.
The EU average is 56 %.
Madam President, two words no more.
But we are going to move onto that.
I think it plays a very important role.
The debate is closed .
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 11.29 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Thank you, Mr Bernard-Reymond.
I think the applause speaks for itself.
That is not what we are here for.
This is a serious European problem.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Financial crisis in South-East Asia
Welcome
That is another question.
They have to import this.
The debate is now closed.
It would cause a revolution!
Well, that is what we must prevent.
Mr Pasty mentioned it earlier on.
I would never have agreed to this.
I believe that this is essential.
We do not live in an ivory tower.
Racism
Asylum policy
(The President cut off the speaker)
I am unable to re-open it.
Is anyone in favour?
This was rejected.
Mr President, I will be voting against.
Mr President, I have a question.
Until then I am unable to do so.
Application of Community law - CELEX
Settlement finality
We support this position.
This was a very important point.
The debate is closed.
I therefore consider it accepted.




Negotiations are still under way.
Now we shall see how things develop.
Thank you, Mr Bangemann.
The debate is closed.
Socrates
The debate is closed.
Wild animals in zoos
So that is where we stand today.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
This is scandalous.
What does immediately mean?
(Mixed reactions)
First it was drugs, now asylum policy.
This is unparliamentary behaviour.
Thank you very much, Mr Watson!
Training of seafarers
They just needed to react properly.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m.
Trans-European hydrological networks
We need studies on reforestation.
Let us not wait for more crises.
That is one condition.
However, water is vital for everyone.
Two questions must, however, be asked.
It seems quite normal to me.
Mr Pinel's comment earlier was correct.
What about agricultural reform?
That is unacceptable.
That is also being considered.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m.
For example, the death penalty.


I expected no less from him.
The debate is closed.
Votes
We can, therefore, support this report.
Pack report (A4-0012/98)
White report (A4-0010/98)
But that is another subject.
Recommendation on racism (B4-0108/98)
I warmly congratulate him for them!
These are fundamental questions.
Thors report (A4-0008/98)
Izquierdo Collado Report (A4-0407/97)
This is an initial report.
The thought alone is absurd.
That concludes Voting Time.
Adjournment of the session
The sitting was closed at 12.10 p.m.
Resumption of the session
Tourism
But that is not the case.
This type of thing cannot continue.
Everyone can see that.
But you fail to appreciate this.
The related decisions are forthcoming.
I think the past is now the past.
To deplore and condemn is not enough.
This work has been done by Mr De Luca.
That would be the wrong route to take.
We all know the importance of tourism.
That is the position of most of us.
Does the Commission agree with that?
I hope we are going to get answers.
And I am not alone in this.
There are a number of aspects to this.
This saga is nearly ten years old.
But this saga is a litany of failure.
It is far far too slow.
That is not so.
Mr President, the text is in French.
The debate is closed.
Macro-financial assistance for Ukraine
Now to the macro-financial programme.
That is all too obvious.
The Commission has indicated the same.

A reliable energy sector is needed.
The debate is closed.
R & D activities (1997 annual report)
Undoutably, improvements will be made.
The debate is closed.
Risks from chemical agents
Mr Hughes had to do it too.
Why do people take unnecessary risks?
We all do it now and then.
Why is this?
I remember the case in Bhopal, India.
He has done an excellent job.
In other words, it will go further.
This idea cannot therefore be retained.
Amendment No 8 is politically delicate.
It will not be long.
Question Time (Commission)
Could this be sorted out?
Thank you for this additional question.
Subject: Internet and Community Law
This is not possible.
Question No 62 by Ian White (H-0112/98)
Subject: First-weight mail rates
Can you please reply in detail?
Thank you very much, Mr Papoutsis.
We believe the time is ripe for this.
Both claims are wrong.
They are certainly enormous.
We know that.
It needs to invest money.
Maybe you will take that as a warning.
Fuels must be improved.
But it is the polluter who should pay.
Employment is an issue in Europe.
It might go the other way.
That is all I wanted to say.

Even Mr Bangemann changed his view.
So thank you for the debate.
The debate is closed.
It says very little about it.
We have tried to clarify that.
We need to consolidate its work.
This is a functional Agency.
It is not a think-tank.
It is necessary for the Community.
The debate is closed.
Ionized food
We are now down to three products.
So it is hard to argue a hypothesis.
A start was made many years back.
They will not work.
These proposals would guarantee that.
That is a way to mislead consumers.
It is unacceptable.
It is incoherent.
I am satisfied with that.
Europe has mountains of food.
Thank you, Madam Commissioner.
It is simply not on.
It is outrageous!
Are we supposed to defend all this?
I will not stand for it!
It is not on!
Or perhaps I have misunderstood.
We can and will do that.
Please convey this to the President.
What happens then?
The debate is closed.
Landfill of waste
I do not believe that it does.
The clear answer is no.
Where will Mr Blair find that?
Incineration is not inevitable.
They agreed it by a majority.
These are big improvements.
And now the reality.
Both have their problems.
He was right to do that.
I congratulate Mrs Jackson.
This situation must change.
It is very simple.
I hope that she does.
We can accept Amendment No 23.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
I hope it reaches the right decisions.
We are not ashamed to say so.
(Applause)
This House does many things well.
Why not?
Yes, colleagues, that includes you!
(Applause)
Page 12 is wrong.
I participated and am recorded as such.
The Minutes are wrong in both areas.
I ask that they be corrected.
I refer to the Minutes last night.
That is not good enough.
I note this with shame!
(The Minutes were approved)
Topical and urgent debate (objections)
It has happened several times before.
Situation in Iraq
The answer I believe is clear.
He did so against his own people.
We reject that.
This is not surprising.
Murder is routine.
Over a thousand people were murdered.'
There can be no compromise on this.
In our view, information is not enough.
A military conflict should be avoided.
We wish him every success with it.
So what should we do?
We have three motivating factors.
There can be no doubt about that.
So far, it has not become clear to me.
Europe must bear that in mind.
We had already read this in the papers.
This is a dangerous situation.
It is not about the threat from Iraq.
There are no more spare parts.
Industry is paralyzed.
This is an essential point.
Why?
Each of us will then do our parts.
Today Saddam, tomorrow someone else.
We do not want that.
This is simply unacceptable.
Yes.
My answer is, albeit reluctantly, yes.
That is what happened before.
It must not happen again.
There my parallel ends.
There is confusion.
These are shifting sands.
Two wrongs do not make a right.
Will this be achieved through bombs?
The answer is certainly no.
What will happen after the bombing?
What will happen to Iraq's population?
Diplomacy works slowly.
Would he give a confirmation on that?
They have been obstructed.
Therefore, action has to be taken.
Events are moving very quickly.
It was rejected.
Votes
I will put it to the vote.
The Parliament is sovereign.
One of them even rang nine times.
I apologize again.
Thank you, Mrs Marinucci.
I shall explain why.
Consequently, we cannot demand them.
This is extremely important.
It is a question...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Why?
I cannot imagine it.
This is what will improve air quality.
I am in favour of the Lange report.
I ask you: what are they up to?
This would make controls easier.
But the Agency cannot work alone!
I welcome discussion on this report.
Thank you, Mr Moorhouse.




This is unfortunate.
Again, this is unfortunate.
It is the same old story.
Thank you, Mr Vecchi.
My questions relate to Burma.
This, however, has just not happened.
This is my first point.
I think that should suffice.
I want now to move to Burma.
We expect to make a decision shortly.
I just want to explain a few points.
So there is a lot at stake.
That is not true.
Thank you, Commissioner Mar√≠n.
They do not see the government.
They see Shell.
What is happening in Nigeria?
The second question relates to Burma.
We are not alone in our criticism.
Thank you, Mr Thomas Mann.
It must be very pleasing to Abacha!
I cited Total as one example.
Thank you, Commissioner Mar√≠n.
The debate is closed.
Situation in Albania
The language alone is revealing.
I hope all will go well.
I hope this, because I am an optimist.
Thank you very much, Mr Tamino.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
I am glad to link the questions.
What is the Council's assessment?
Is this related, Mr President?
Does this √©chalon exist?
Subject: Human cloning
You refer in some way to future plans.
Subject: Arms trafficking in Burundi
Subject: Arms trafficking in Burundi
Subject: Arms trafficking in Burundi

The text is in two parts.
They are just as bad in this case.
That will always be the case.
Is that, as ever, possible?
From the arms industry, perhaps?
If not, why not?
Otherwise it could still be undermined.
Thank you very much, Mr von Habsburg.
Who will make the decisions?
So far he has failed to do so.
So I urge him to proceed with care.
But there has to be a limit somewhere.
So I hope for a positive response.
Subject: Consumer protection
There is a very positive agenda.
Subject: Tax-free sales
Thank you Mr President-in-Office.
I listened to John Prescott yesterday.
It does not surprise me.
New arrangements are required.
This is really funny.
My question is brief.
What tax rates do they apply?
That concludes Question Time.
Air transport liberalization
It is not.
They cannot.
Safety must be assured.
That must affect safety.
We need controlled liberalization.
That is what we must realize.
That, I believe, must change.
It needs to be discussed.
That must be changed.
Mr President, I have one final point.
In actual fact, many have not survived.
This is a dramatic point.
We cannot go on like this any longer!
That is certainly true of state aid.
I will certainly act upon it.
The debate is closed.
Cabin crews in civil aviation
At least I hope so.
How do we do that?
Tonight we should reflect on that.
This is a very important report.
I am delighted to support this report.
We strive for nil, naturally.
We can therefore accept Amendment No 8.
But that is not the case.
The debate is closed.

And everybody agreed with him.
I wonder then what they are paid for.
That to me seems a backward step.
I recommend that we accept this report.
Let me make just two short remarks.
I am grateful to the honourable Member.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
I am not on the list either.
That is in the official record.
It is something other than a new rule.
But it is not.
We must check it.
We are still approving the Minutes.
I want to make a correction here.
Mr R√ºbig has received this letter.
I have seen a copy of it.
(Applause)
Then this report was submitted.
I cannot check it quickly this morning.
Which are they?
I think that will suffice!
That is all we are asking for.
Mistakes can be made.
That will be corrected, Mr Sturdy.
However, we have done so.
(The Minutes were approved)
Animal feed
Our legislation should serve this aim.
Many would see the importance of this.
I am familiar with both.
But what happens to imports?
The discussion is closed.
Impact of biotechnology on agriculture
The first is environmental.
Money is money after all!
We must proceed with extreme caution.
Confidence is of the essence.
Great care is essential.
There are certain risks.
Government must curb man's laxity.
It means we should build and maintain.
However, time is not yet running out!
Labelling is still an illusion.
Nature can hit back!
I therefore welcome this initiative.
Time has moved on.
Thank you very much for all your work!
Thank you, Madam Rapporteur.
The discussion is now closed.
Welcome
Mr President, on a point of order.
Votes
Very well, Mr Falconer.
Thank you very much, Mrs Poisson.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That is not correct.
Very well, Mr Falconer.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Grosch report (A4-0018/98)
Le Rachinel report (A4-0014/98)
Le Rachinel report (A4-0024/98)
Poisson report (A4-0020/98)
Berend report (A4-0016/98)
I come from the rural area.
Joint motion for a resolution on Iraq
Suffer the little children indeed!
Europe was active and present.
We deplore this fact.
Seal report (A4-0015/98)
Keppelhoff-Wiechert report (A4-0037/98)
We cannot support it.
This is by no means unproblematic.
We need to have a coherent position.
That right has been removed.
Topical and urgent debate
A stop should be put to this.
This situation is intolerable.
They need our solidarity.
We should not allow that!
The Mullah dictatorship must be ended.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
But nothing of the kind has been done.
Talk of arrogance.
This literally oversteps all limits.
But what is the true face of Iran?
Reality is dramatically different.
Mauritania
Our text does nothing of the sort.
You can see right through it.
The others did not even do so.
This does arouse suspicion.
Chile
We should not talk them into it.
Belarus
You are right.
Congo
I have my own opinion on the matter.
I would never say that.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed
Thank you, Commissioner, Mar√≠n.
The debate is closed.
Floods in Greece
All that must be made good at once.
But that, Mr Mar√≠n, is not enough.
They need special protection.
Instead, what do you do?
Storm in Malaga .
Thank you, Commissioner Mar√≠n.
The debate is closed.
If everyone agrees, we can approve it.
After the vote on floods in Greece :
I raise the issue as a question.
For what reason?
Then why this debate?
Why this trick against Parliament?
Are we to continue playing this game?
So it is no news to most of us.
Mrs Green is also only partly right.
That was my first point.
I arrived ten minutes late.
Thank you.
That concludes the debate.
This statement applies quite generally.
SLIM is a worthwhile undertaking.
This is Community customs legislation.
It is now 1998.
That is the first serious objection.
The debate is closed.
Short-term statistics
We will follow his lead.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.05 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Can that be corrected please?
That is a very important correction.
(The Minutes were approved)
Votes
The reason for it is quite simple.
That is a very good suggestion.
The rapporteur has done his job well.
Thors report (A4-0028/98)
Crowley report (A4-0033/98)
System of own resources
This does in fact mean two amendments.
The administration is too expensive.
We support that.
But in doing so we send out signals.
That is politics.
That is not bookkeeping.
It is too complicated for us.
That costs more than it brings in.
It costs too much to chase that.
It costs more than it brings in.
That is part of Amendment No 1.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
I cannot support this report.
Development finance
I am very pleased about that, Alex.
But you can see the root cause of this.
It does not ask for our opinion.
It is a long story.
We shall wait and see.
No!
This procedure is absurd!
Fine, we will sort it out without you.'
Not otherwise.
This is certainly not true.
We have already underlined this here.
The Council should be told.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Community cereals trade
It is succinct and to the point.
It has a lot to do with the report.
That is a lot of legislation and money.
How is this possible?
Could that be looked at again?
Does the Commission intend to do this?
How is this possible?
It will not do.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Before the vote on Amendment No 6
My colleague can confirm this.
I always sit here.
I did vote.
So you have no cause for concern.
In favour?
Thank you.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
The same thing happened this morning.
Why?
But how can we achieve this?
So it is a good thing.
That is the case in Sweden.
The same applies to this report.
This report helps this to be achieved.
We must work against this.
So I welcome these programmes.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
That is unfortunately not true.
Thank you very much, Mr Posselt.
No.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 11.35 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Mr R√ºbig.
(The Minutes were approved)
(The President cut off the speaker)
It will be done.
Resignation of a Vice-President
Order of business
The next item is the order of business.
Monday: no changes.
Tuesday:
(Parliament approved the proposal)
(Parliament approved the request)
Wednesday:
Thursday: no changes.
Friday:
I beg to move.
It is time that was ended.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
Thank you, Mrs Green.
It is as much a...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(Parliament approved the request)
Women's rights

Nowhere in Europe!
Nowhere!
We should not remain silent.
They must know that they are not alone.
They must wear veils.
Unfortunately, no!
We agree to it.
The debate is closed.
Sale of consumer goods and guarantees
Automobile clubs have welcomed this.
Surely, therefore, something is wrong.
Reversal of the burden of proof.
I congratulate Mrs Kuhn on her report.
They do not belong in this directive.
Sometimes the consumer will lie.
He is not to blame.
We back this choice.
This clearly is not the case here.
Legally this is rather suspect.
That concludes the debate.
Green Paper on food law
A very important area is the HACCP.
My last point is on labelling.
The report is also about transparency.
The same goes for irradiated food.
The Green Paper is not enough.
They need to understand what they read.
That is the way to make progress.
That is all I can say on the timetable.
Things really should not be this way.
I think those are the main points.
There is no other alternative.
The debate is closed.
Decentralized Community institutions
Upon which safeguards are we insisting?
And of course, they have not.
That is why this report has come about.
Such stories are irresponsible.
I urge the House to support it.
It received 40 000.
It is an entirely new area of activity.
The debate is closed.
Closing of the session
(The sitting was closed at 8.10 p.m.)
Opening of annual session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Are there any further comments?
Thank you.
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr President, on a point of order.
(Applause )
But now to specifics.
Our Group fully agrees with this.
This is not acceptable.
A code of conduct might not suffice.
Secondly, tourists - the consumers.
There are also extremes, of course.
So tourism is plagued by uncertainty.
They need to know how to convert.
My mind boggles when I think about it.
Perhaps it is too embarrassed.
That is a ludicrous position.
I therefore ask what cost?
This is a really crucial issue.
First the good news.
I will leave this view for what it is.
This is in fact anti-democratic.
There is no clarity on this yet.
That is no longer going to be possible.
That is a serious figure.
That deals with the practical aspects.
What will the impact be?
Why?
Mr President, I asked one question.
I have taken note of your question.
We will respond directly to it.
Thank you for the information on Spain.
The joint debate is closed.
Promoting road safety in the EU
Their son had died.
They looked ten years older.
That means 900 a week.
Allow me to mention a few.
Why has he done that?
Firstly, we must combat drink-driving.
Let us see some action.
The technology is there.
What is lacking is the political will.
We absolutely must jump this hurdle.
My last point is a curious one.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Votes
It is quite clear.
I think Mr Falconer agrees.
I did not vote.
It was never brought to this Chamber.
It has all been noted very carefully.
I really could do no more.
It is really very interesting.
Kuhn report (A4-0029/98)
Ownership costs SEK 20 000 per variety.
Kellett-Bowman report (A4-0035/98)
I just wanted that point to be made.
Graenitz report (A4-0009/98)
I therefore support Amendment No 28.
I give this my full support.
In my opinion, this is well-justified.
That is unacceptable.
Arroni report (A4-0061/98)
Torres Marques report (A4-0078/98)
It is not far off.
Wolf report (A4-0070/98)
But that is not the case.
How can we redress the balance?
That would be disastrous.
We do not think it should be.
Arroni, Torres Marques and Wolf reports
That would simplify our votes greatly.
But that is another matter.
I would point out that it is 1.29 p.m.
We cannot impose on the interpreters.
Madam President, I agree with you.
I will reserve and protect that right.
I refuse to be treated as a child.
The opposite also applies of course.
Let me say something about speed.
We would endorse that fully.
Others do not favour targets at all.
We will have to discuss it further.
Secondly, Mr President, the budget.
Noblesse oblige .
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Registration of ships' passengers
The case is therefore overwhelming.
I accept that.
I believe that is a necessity.
So the tunnel has its risks too.
I recognize the need for safety.
Safety is of course a high requirement.
Everybody wants it.
That is not good legislation.
I believe it is bad legislation.
This is not necessary.
I welcome that, of course.
I want to emphasize that.
The debate is closed.
The MAI has got an interesting history.
We must be very wary of this.
It will now!
This is another crucial point.
Yet the US is stepping on the brakes.
They claim they need more time.
It comes from the OECD countries.
Again, in principle, I welcome that.
So we want more democracy.
The MAI is a real lesson to us.
You can have too much of a good thing.
A proviso to this effect is included.
It is taking on a lot.
The MAI is thus one-sided.
That is a temporary solution at best.
We would like to raise three issues.
Will it be public or closed?
What are the rules on evidence?
It is far too important for that.
It is of great concern.
This is a timely debate.
The negotiations are not completed.
I wish to say a word about that.
And we succeeded.
It was the United States which blinked.
I asked a very specific question.
(The President cut off the speaker )
I thought I had answered the question.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
It should be in its rightful place.
Could you give me an answer, please?
Subject: Beef market
We will have to look into the facts.
Subject: Sport and Alcohol Sponsorship
I am not able to go beyond that.
Subject: Anti-dumping duties
There is really no mystery about this.
That is a legitimate argument.
We have done so in this case.
It is very difficult.
It is impossible to please everybody.
Subject: Salmonella
Subject: Salmonella inspections
That is the objective.


I genuinely thank him for that.
Thank you, Mrs Ferrer.
That is the question.
Question No 63 by Ian White (H-0172/98)
Subject: Urban II
Is there such a rule book?
I have to agree with you.
Subject: Application of Interreg II C
It is merely a difference of approach.
That is what we have done in this case.
Vessels carrying dangerous goods
This is a very serious issue.
The debate is closed.
Statistics are essential for transport.
We need a more precise system.
That is a great failing.
Both these exceptions are positive.
The debate is closed.
The proposed budget is meaningless.
So we welcome research.
I hope they will receive your support.
That is what we are hoping to develop.
That is not ideological.
I hear what the Commissioner says.
Great challenges are ahead.
These must all come under one umbrella.
I believe this is essential today.
We need to review this directive.
We cannot have it both ways.
We need to modify our existing model.
Madam President, I will finish now.
There are serious differences.
So let us specify five-year programmes.
I have two final points.
Europe is ageing.
Thank you Madam President.
Let us be clear about that.
You want to see more done.
That is a view the Commission shares.
We will see what happens then.
I am going to take note of that.
It does not make sense.
Everybody said how important it was.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.28 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Good morning, Mr President.
Action is required.
This cannot go on.
Thank you very much, Mr Sindal.
(The Minutes were approved)
Now to the social sector.
We stand by it!
They know what is going on.
It requires changes on both sides.
That goes without saying, Mr President.
This has been accepted by everybody.
I think that has been resolved.
This is one of those times.
Let me remind you of what I have said.
Now is the time, tomorrow is too late.
This is not our intention.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The President cut off the speaker)
Not everything will be plain sailing.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Why these two groups?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Situation in Kosovo
What have we done?
Let me try to make that clear as well.
The European Union took little action.
Nobody saw it, nobody wanted to see it.
It never takes preventive action.
That is totally unacceptable.
It is the right path.
More pressure will be needed.
That will be the crux of the matter.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Votes
That is most generous, Mr Falconer.
It means at the start of the session.
I have noted that you are here.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Please sit down now.
You have exceeded your one minute.
That is what I was attempting to do.
(Loud applause )
I gave you that interpretation.
I answered your point of order.
That is not an acceptable situation.
I am sorry.
I take your first point.
That is to go ahead.
(Applause )
Mr President, on a point of order.
I have some sympathy for that comment.
It is unacceptable, Mr President.
It is being looked into at the moment.
Mr President, on a point of order.
We have to have some clarity.
Members cannot have it both ways.
Mr President, on a point of order.
There can be no discussion about that.
We have voted in favour of this report.
We think that is appropriate.
But what does it matter?
The machine is in motion.
This is enough.
We are happy.
Oostlander report (A4-0087/98)
Watts recommendation (A4-0068/98)
It is a step in the right direction.
Trakatellis report (A4-0067/98)
I support Dr Trakatellis' report.
Viceconte report (A4-0074/98)
Cabrol report (A4-0075/98)
Bazin report (A4-0072/98)
Women's rights
It is a tragedy!
Cornelissen report (A4-0065/98)
This is a step in the right direction.
How does accompanied driving work?
I would like to make a second comment.
It is a cheap but effective method.
Kreissl-D√∂rfler report (A4-0073/98)
Firstly, we challenge the approach.
The MAI is unacceptable!
What a turn up for the books!
in writing.
Flemming report (A4-0022/98)
I voted in favour of the report.
Alzheimer's disease
It was high time they were raised.
Situation in Kosovo (continuation)
This must be done by Mr Milosevic.
But that is not the problem.
That is the big question!
He was accompanied by the Commission.
He will be in Belgrade.
The debate is closed.
ASEM process
These projects must be addressed.
Then there are the jungle fires.
So what lies ahead of us?
ASEM II in April has a solid agenda.
I hope this can be continued.
Hunger and poverty are rife.
Now it is in a bitter learning process.
Do not forget these people.
The joint debate is closed.
International criminal court
What does the Council know about this?
And where will these come from?
The joint debate is closed.
Competitiveness
But there is more to be done.
In short, employability.
Regulation must be simple.
But where is it leading?
Here I have some real questions.
I enjoyed Mr Cassidy's contribution.
He mentioned ritual obeisance.
We are at the earliest possible stage.
He accused me of simple semantics.
We hope this proposal will be welcomed.
Thank you, Mrs Beckett.
It is very enjoyable indeed!
I just do not believe that.
That would be a profound mistake.
I accept that point entirely.
Thank you again, Mrs Beckett.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
Please give me an answer.
Thank you, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo.

Thank you, Mr Henderson.
It is necessary to meet both criteria.
Subject: Presidency of the Council
There is no "Presidency of the Union' .
Each institution has its own president.
Is that also true of the Council?
Or is it prepared to act against drugs?
Thank you very much for your reply.
I thank Mr Lindqvist.
Subject: Financial perspectives
That is recognized by the Council.
Subject: Excise in international waters
That is a political reality.
Subject: Wool
First of all, the answer is no.
Any change would require unanimity.
That is a different matter.
I have nothing further to add.
Subject: The situation in Algeria
I will try to be very brief.
We wish you a good journey.
Mr President, I am sorry.
That is why I am late.
Demographic report 1997
We must adapt to these circumstances.
This is having a huge knock-on effect.
How should we deal with this?
I will mention a few examples.
The same goes for pensions.
Mothers have always worked.
Now, we are all suffering!.
What must we do?
How can this happen?
The debate is closed.
European Training Foundation
This must change in the short term.

The debate is closed.
Action plan and subsidies for Ukraine
It is a big state in population terms.
It is also a big state geographically.
What is its identity?
Therein lies the challenge for Europe.
But weaknesses remain, without a doubt.
Ukraine is important to the continent.
Let us not miss that opportunity.
Let us deepen our relationships.
This situation has already arisen.
At the moment we have no response.
Do we already have a plan to work with?
That is what we need.
One final remark seems necessary.
There is no strategic vision.
The same is true of Bosnia!
What can we do?
The debate is closed.
Consumer protection
Purpose has internal scope.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Please correct this.
It was 15 August, of course.
I raised two points.
I want an official explanation.
Thank you very much, Mr Sindal.
Mr Guti√©rrez D√≠az has the floor.
It will be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
What does the Council propose?
This is not yet the case.
Why is this the case?
But what is being done?
We must make this a reality.
And that is what we want to see.
The money has to be there.
Let us have proper funding.

Thank you once more for your support.
Thank you very much, Mrs Cresson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12.00 noon.
In essence, it is about foreign policy.
The debate is closed.
What can be done?
This should be done in stages.
It has been very successful.
I consider this incorrect and unfair.
It is something which is very possible.
However, it cannot be changed now.
I am convinced that this is possible.
That is good.
I share that view.
I welcome this idea.
Mr Brinkhorst, you are right.
This has happened many times before.
It is not the first time.
It should not happen again!
This will just not do!
Mr Caccavale, the debate has begun.
Votes
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Sorry, Mr Falconer, you are right.
That is too little.
This is important for many reasons.
That is, to say the least, irritating.
Boogerd-Quaak report (A4-0032/98)
Motion for a resolution on Kosovo
Thank you, Mr Posselt.
Cabez√≥n Alonso report (A4-0056/98)
Thank you very much, Mrs Seillier.
Titley report (A4-0059/98)
Hoff report (A4-0063/98)
Topical and urgent debate
(Applause )
These are worrying decisions.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 5.30 p.m.
What are these ECU 9.5 million for?
I believe we failed in this.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 5.30 p.m.
Nicaragua
North Korea
We should make sure we exploit it.
The situation is more than serious.
Congo
So they benefit.
Anyway, I suppose it is near Congo.
Jamaica
Syria
A solution must be found.
Sixthly, I come to Jamaica.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The situation is now as follows.
This should be questioned.
Sierra Leone was founded in freedom.
Its capital is called Freetown.
We in Europe should aid that.
That is right.
Thank you, Commissioner de Silguy.
The debate is closed.
We tried to change the system.
Where are we at now?
This is the stumbling block.
So this is where we are at the moment.
Another thought comes to mind.
It is enshrined in the Treaty.
Sponsors are needed.
I do wonder.
Really no problem at all.
And what has the Commission done?
It must take some action.
Instead he finds that he is not wanted.
We are divided in our replies.
There are tickets available.
You should have intervened then.
We all knew this.
Nothing was done.
This is very serious.
This is my position and I stand by it.
So please, keep things in perspective.
This is the real situation.
(Applause) I am taking note of this.
This really is not our role.
Have a little patience.
This is the current situation.
(Loud applause)
The debate is closed.
Mr Killilea, the debate is now closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Before the vote on Nicaragua:
The House voted for this.
That is the explanation.
This was all somewhat unfortunate.
So much for procedures.
There is a second reason for this.
I have now reached my third point.
Mr Pirker thinks so too.
I will not come back to it.
I just wish to add one point.
Then we will have an orderly debate.
That is the heart of the matter.
That is the heart of the matter.
I find that strange.
And yet we have a two-speed Europe.
We need progress.
Common legal standards are not enough.
We want a common standard of justice.
This report rightly points to this.
The debate is closed.
Work of ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 1997
These weaknesses must be remedied.
This situation can arise very easily.
We are well on our way.
That is ridiculous.
We must cut the red tape.
There must be more of these meetings.
The debate is closed.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.30 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Are there any other comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Votes
Mr Tillich had understood perfectly.
Yes, exactly.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Robles Piquer report (A4-0080/98)
Not only that, the report is very late.
Let us not be shy.
We should talk about them.
The Varela report also says as much.
We wait for it to be formulated.
It is about salmon fishing.
This is a major problem.
That is what we are discussing today.
Fourthly, there is a lack of funding.
I certainly agree.
There are two considerations.
The other is economic.
I do not blame the Commission.
No-one takes any notice.
I want to make a specific complaint.
I do not want to be nationalistic.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
There are various reasons for this.
Good morning, Madam President.
Thank you, Mr Macartney.
Thank you, Mrs Langenhagen.
You now have the floor, Mrs Bonino.
This has been a great problem.
Two further thoughts.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
On paragraph 3:
Mr Macartney has the floor.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Congratulations, Mr Cunha.
This is what this report is about.
It is a very restricted report.
The Union, too, must push for results.
Thank you very much, Mrs Bonino.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
On Amendment No 1:
You have the floor, Mr McMahon.
There is no "is' or "should' .
That is what we shall do.
You have the floor, Mrs Berger.
My train goes at 12 a.m.
Thank you, Mrs Berger.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mrs Bonino.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, on a point of order.
Thank you very much, Mr Hallam.
Mr Ford now has the floor.
Mr President, on a point of order.
That is also unacceptable.
In my opinion, the former is the case.
Thank you, Mr Wieland.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 12.00 noon)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mr Kinnock.
I agree entirely with your sentiments.
Some of us react badly to that.
Has this since happened?
Madam President, on a point of order.
Mrs Thors, what you say is right.
(The Minutes were approved)
Order of business
It was a joint debate.
So I think that clarifies things.
That is the background.
(Parliament gave its assent)
You are presenting it orally.
It is not possible.
That is going to take place this week.
My group is agnostic on this issue.
(Parliament withheld its assent)
That would be impossible.
(Parliament gave its assent)
(The order of business was adopted)
They are currently only in French.
We will check the situation.
That is the problem.
I fully understand.
Tourism
That will bring a real benefit.
I have been given three minutes.
I should like to finish.
Mr Harrison, I should explain.
I will have to ask you to round off.
This is something we should defend.
That is not the case, however.
First on subsidiarity.
Have we gone completely mad?
My second point.
Now, I do not really support that.
Look at paragraph 8.
I can see what would happen.
But, beware!
The debate is closed.
Airport charges
This idea is basic in my proposals.
I even think it is counterproductive.
Many of them feed to Inverness.
It was overbooked.
The debate is closed.
Parking card for the disabled
I think that is important.
In this case it is.
To be honest, I think it is a disgrace.
The debate is closed.
Recording equipment in road vehicles
What is it about?
In fact, something new has cropped up.
Now to my conclusions.
It seems so simple.
Bravo to that.
Mr President, what is going on?
Actually the matter is quite simple.
This is inadequate in many respects.
Who is hiding something here and why?
Neither have anything in common.
The debate is closed.
I will come to that now.
Amendments Nos 1 and 2.
This covers retired workers.
I wish to deal with them.
Secondly, access to health care.
Thirdly, civil servants: progress?
That is not really progress.
He probably did not want to answer!
That is important to say on the record.
So this is not the place to do it.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.30 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
However, at least we received them.
But we need to take that extra time.
Let us hope that it works.
We expect reports on that.
I have two final points on this report.
The Commission does not contest this.
We cannot have a duplication of work.
There remain the outstanding debts.
This we do not like.
What did the manufacturer do?
The difference is a matter of degree.
What does this reveal?
It reveals a loss in confidence.
This is a major problem.
But why did you fail to inform us?
That is where the mistrust lies.
Hence the misgivings on our part.
We can well appreciate that.
This is the key point.
This concerns staff policy.
We accept that.
I recommend this to the House.
What is the current system?
Should something not be done about it?
They are not better people, after all.
Let it remain there.
That is something to be welcomed.
That has not been easy.
This is something to be followed.
The second comment concerns personnel.
It's pretty laughable really.
And how do you react?
With timidity.
My third comment involves the EDF.
I would like to thank you overall.
Neither seems to be living in reality.
So, my congratulations!
It is not.
It is a manifestation of failure.
There has, indeed, been progress.
I wanted to emphasize that.
There is some kind of paradox here.
Computers are getting faster every day.
We look forward to it.
What does that mean?
We got the first DAS in autumn 1995.
Irregularities, not fraud.
That was in autumn 1995.
That will be done.
The new regulations are very clear.
The debate is closed.
Taxpayers cannot understand this.
What can be done?
Yes, I would just like to explain that.
I am speaking on a point of order.
There is no lack of proposals!
It is an important area.
Thank you for the report.
This was fully recognized in Amsterdam.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Votes

The rapporteur is fully aware of that.
I therefore oppose it.
I oppose referral back to committee.
Thank you, Mrs Theato.
Then we shall make a decision.
Is this in fact correct?
Is that right?
I did not make myself clear.
We are in agreement on that.
I cannot make any other suggestions.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
V√§yrynen report (A4-0008/98)
Aparicio S√°nchez report (A4-0071/98)

Is this by chance?
Kellett-Bowman report (A4-0092/98)
Theato report (A4-0082/98)
Financial assistance for SMEs
SMEs generate new jobs.
It is also a rather meaningless name.
This is very important.
We could all give examples like that.
That is when the test comes.
I hope so.
We need further training.
That is why we drew up this proposal.
Is that not correct?
Yes, it is covered.
The debate is closed.
This German blockade must be broken.
But Mr President, that is about it.
That is also her right.
This year's average is 0.27 %.
And that is a matter of figures, sir!
The difference of opinion is there.
The debate is closed.
Horizontal state aid
That can and will happen.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I did not ask about the policy.
We would like some flexibility.
It is up to you.
The debate is closed.
Shipbuilding
That is not what it is intended for.
This is extremely positive.
It is the way forward.
That is embarrassing.
I hope the Commission understands this.
Securing these jobs is important.
And why?
But what happened?
But that is not all.
Will there be consequences or not?
And if so, what?
Will they be good or bad?
Thank you very much, Mr Sainjon.
It will resume at 9.00 p.m.
Question Time (Commission)
The third point is admissibility.
Mr President, on a point of order.
It is on the same issue.
Mr McMahon, please listen to me.
But let us start by respecting them.
I completely agree.
So are they the same, or more?
I have taken note of your remark.
You have done well to emphasize them.
Thank you very much, Mr de Silguy.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Subject: Consumers and the euro
Can I ask two brief questions?
I shall be very precise on this point.
Thank you very much, Mr de Silguy.
Subject: Transport of animals
Thank you very much, Mrs Bonino.
You have one minute, Mrs Jensen.
My name is not Kirsten Jensen.
My name is Lis Jensen.
I can provide more details in writing.
Subject: MAGP IV: Beam trawler length
I must be very clear.
I hope that is clear.
That is understood.
Is that true?
Maybe I was not clear.
This is the result of what I am saying.
For us it was a non-starter.
Is that clear now?
Subject: New Argentinean fisheries law
Thank you very much, Mrs Bonino.
The matter is delayed for that reason.
Thank you for the information.
Thank you very much, Mr Flynn.
Subject: "Star' Alliance
If not, why not?
Thank you very much, Mr Flynn.
Subject: Strengthening the family
You spoke primarily of working women.
Thank you very much, Mr Flynn.
That would be particularly helpful.
Thank you very much, Mr Monti.
So we will finish at 7.10 p.m..
A study would be counterproductive.
I wonder why?
There is no such study.
I have no particular axe to grind.
Thank you very much, Mr Monti.
That concludes Question Time.
Thank you very much indeed.
Shipbuilding (continuation)
I myself come from a shipbuilding city.
We cannot allow that.
That is of the utmost importance.
But today, who could say as much?
That was the situation.
That is where the future lies.
This is the logic of our regime.
Do you wish to keep this policy or not?
The Commission believes that we should.
Now I will look at Korea.
Before, in practice, we could not.
That was one point I wanted to make.
The debate is closed.
Passenger vehicles
I welcome the Commission's proposals.
I am pleased to be able to say that.
This is very important.
We should grant them type approval.
I ask the House to support it.
They are reliant on public transport.
This is a very important area.
These are our aims.
We did not do so.
We have in fact done so.
That has also been said.
That is our position.
Of course I accept your invitation.
The debate is closed.
Trading of goods
Intrastat was created.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.00 p.m)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
It is very clear, Mr McMahon.
These are not new rules.
(Applause )
This is not my problem.
We shall see, that is all.
That is all.
I did take these into account.
This incident is closed.
I am not going to give more time to it.
(The Minutes were approved)
Topical and urgent debate (objections)
It is not a question of human rights.
Thank you very much, Mr Pasty.
Preparations are in hand for that.
Otherwise, further errors will be made.
We are also carrying forward that work.
This is the fundamental point.
It is more than a report about the ACP.
We and the ACP states should note that.
That is to be welcomed.
That should also be put into effect.
Indeed, what happens at the moment?
From now on it will be up to them.
What does the honourable Member want?
Allow me to explain a few points.
The emphasis here is on step by step.
This should be our aim.
So for us this is a special concern.
That is its proper place.
This is my final point.
Keep at it!
But this never actually happened.
Mr President, what should happen now?
We really need an impact study on this.
That is the challenge of the next era.
That is absolutely right.
We must make sure it is implemented.
We need to put that in place.
We must improve our capacity to do so.
That is agreed.
Members know the procedure.
I have to move on.
EU-Russia relations
That leads a society to despair.
It is an unprecedented phenomenon.
Neither side needs to discuss that.
The danger is still before us.
What does this actually mean, though?
It is quite a disgrace.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at voting time.
On 9 March we gave the starting signal.
We have 323 votes.
But it is still possible to sign!
(Applause)
Madam President, on a point of order.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Thank you, Mr Howitt.
I would like to have that information.
Firstly, we verified the facts.
It is indeed a problem.
It appears not.
According to this letter ...
(Laughter.
Heckling: ' April fool!' )
Votes
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Why?
That is extremely important.
(Applause)
(Applause and heckling)
We are being heard.
We owe that to our citizens!
Is this factor not important?
We have come a long way since then.
Why have a monetary Europe?
Why have an independent central bank?
For monetary stability?
The answer is "yes' .
The answer is certainly not.
Indeed, this is common sense.
This seems unquestionable.
It is the same throughout Europe.
That is what is at stake at the moment.
Let me give you an example.
That will not happen in the future.
What we want is a broad dialogue.
Who should this partner be?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Firstly, the European Conference.
The day was full of symbolism.
The task ahead of us is a great task.
You are on the right path.
Such signals are expected.
I believe that it was a good start!
I think that is obvious.
The work can start now.
It has no ambition.
The debate is closed.
A new start is necessary.
The Americans need 15 % for theirs.
Those are the optimistic points.
The European Union applauds that.
That meets Parliament's wishes.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Question Time (Council)
Mr Henderson has requested to speak.
Good evening and welcome, Mr Henderson.
I am afraid I have to leave at 7 p.m.
I have to leave at 7 p.m.
You may go whenever you want to.
We will examine the possibility.
Subject: Return of the Elgin Marbles
Subject: The Elgin Marbles
Subject: Return of the Elgin Marbles
The Minister's answer is incorrect.
Mr President, on a procedural matter.
He has only replied to Question No 1.
You know the city.
Mr President, I will be brief.
It is a longstanding decision.
I can add no more at the present time.
It should be fact.
Could he confirm that to me?
I am not as confident as that.
That was the position at that time.
I will be very brief.
I do not follow the logic.
It has joined the ERM.
Subject: The EIB's information policy
Thank you very much, Mr Henderson.
I fear you want to leave us.
That concludes Question Time.
This must stop!
So what is happening?
Europe is watching us!
We think that is good.
What is the issue here?
I believe there is hope for the future.
I just wanted to let you know this.
That is how it has been set.
That is all we are really.
He could not do otherwise.
The debate is closed.
Methane emissions .
I am speaking in his place.
We must do the calculations.
What moves people?
It is expressed in the decision.
I thank you for listening to me.
They were extremely pessimistic.
This will be very welcome news to you.
That is our aim.
That is the point you make.
It is an interesting idea.
The debate is closed.
Suitability of blood donors
It saves lives.
This is a step back.
It is an excellent report.
Amendment No 3.
The debate is closed.
We should not mistake this for a war.
There is much for us to do there, too.
Oh that it were so!
It concerns the Treaty of Amsterdam.
That is not what we voted for.
This is not so.
What are these guidelines?
The second issue is transparency.
We are making progress here.
My last point concerns accountability.
That process will continue this year.
How can we conclude?
He said that peace has broken out.
It certainly has.
Peace has broken out with the agencies.
Vigilance is the key, Mr Liikanen!
The debate is closed.
Be careful!
(The sitting was closed at 11.35 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
He really did annoy me.
The problem will be solved.
That is what I would like.
(The Minutes were approved )
Rules of Procedure (new Rule 44a)
Mr President, thank you very much.
Oh, he has just come in!
Perfect.
That is timing!
We just have a debate, or we do not.
That is a non-solution.
I wish to welcome Mr Crowley's report.
The debate is closed.
What is it about?
We need to clarify that.
As I see it, it meets two requirements.
The debate is closed.
She had a difficult task to accomplish.
He is only allowed to do so in Germany.
We guaranteed this from 1 January 1993.
Of course, there are problems.
Thank you, Mr Nassauer.
It is full of good intentions.
Should they expect more?
'So what?' you might think.
I could go on and on.
We brought them here to work for us.
The other two must go back.
This must be remembered.
But that is no surprise.
The logic of this escapes me.
So we need to put everything in order.
I believe they expect things of us.
Thank you very much, Mrs Gradin.
The debate is closed.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Welcome
Votes
(Parliament adopted the decision)
Before the vote on paragraph 8
That is my request.
We will continue with the votes.
They did not work.
I am very sorry.
Could you repeat the vote please?
I think that was the case.
(The President repeated the vote)
After the vote on Annex 3
Thank you very much, Mr Falconer.
That will be noted.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Before the vote on Amendment No 5
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
This situation cannot be tolerated!
Cabrol report (A4-0112/98)
We cannot legislate for morals.
Lalumi√®re report (A4-0060/98)
It is an extremely important one.
But are they capable of listening?
However, the reality is far from this.
Topical and urgent debate
Europe should not stand idly by.
And the news from Amazonia is worrying.
Thank you very much, Mr Pinheiro.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 4.30 p.m.
We need to resume this dialogue.
Cameroon
The freedom of speech is sacred.
That is our problem.
We do indeed have a great task here.
Death penalty in the United States
Wake-up!
Thank you very much, Mr Pinheiro.
Thank you very much, Mr Posselt.
VOTES (continuation)
Are there any objections?
Before the vote on paragraph 5
It concerns paragraph 5.
This is a difficult situation for me.
That was the problem.
That is the problem we are faced with.
Then we shall see who has a majority.
Let us try to keep calm about this.
That is regrettable.
It is merely a question of nuances.
I misunderstood your last point.
I quite clearly read the proposal out.
There is no question about that.
(Applause)
If you like, I can read you Rule 116...
But that did not happen.
Daskalaki report (A4-0106/98)
Marset Campos report (A4-0120/98)
This is not a feasible solution.
However, we must of course help them.
Then we shall be making progress!
That cannot be correct.
The word freedom is not repeated.
The word justice is not repeated.
Fear is not removed, but whipped up.
The debate is closed.
Let that be made clear.
I shall now say why.
Let that be stated.
(Mr Voggenhuber asked for the floor)
Mrs Roth abstained in the final vote.
Neither did you.
I wonder why not?
Has this project succeeded?
It is indispensable.
We shall not get anywhere like this.
(Applause)
Why do I say "lame' ?
The same is true of Articles 8 and 9.
We cannot allow this procedural game.
This is an important principle.
Driving disqualification
I can now reassure them on this point.
This is absurd.
The proposal is an interesting one.
This is a praiseworthy ambition.
The debate is closed.
Abolition of duty-free sales
We have had other studies of course.
I take those points on board.
My group supports the resolution.
That promise was never fulfilled.
It is overdue, it is necessary.
It is the one little perk they have.
What are we proposing?
And what will be achieved?
This does not represent a problem.
It was almost what I was expecting.
I can imagine that you want this.
And so we are pussyfooting around.
That is why you are avoiding it.
However, we are not in that position.
Jobs are tied up in this.
We do not have any other jobs.
We are counting on this.
Our future depends on it.
I represent the people.
So that is the problem we face.
It is Catch 22.
That is simply not the case.
Whose fault is that?
It is very simplistic.
Some of them have to do with taxation.
Taxation on labour has gone up 7 %.
What is the reason for that?
A lack of tax coordination.
(The President interrupted the speaker)
A study may have two components.
Thank you, Mr Ford.
We shall not be re-opening the debate.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.05 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
That is what was agreed yesterday.
Thank you very much.
I have made a note of it.
Twelve Members opposed this amendment.
Mr Falconer, you were here yesterday.
Several of us were here yesterday.
Thank you, Mr President.
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr Hallam, I totally agree.
We will look into it, however.
But I may be wrong.
So it really is a bit much.
Votes
That is the first point.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
Reding report (A4-0121/98)
Posselt report (A4-0107/98)
We had, in fact, already suggested it.
I cannot accept this.
Global Satellite Navigation System
This is not just true of air transport.
We are working away steadily at this.
There are also reasons to be alert.
The main reasons are as follows.
That is why we have no time to lose.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Construction of the Chernobyl shelter

This aim is unrealistic.
We should record that fact here.
We know about these problems.
We discussed them just this week.
We want more transparency here.
I thank him for the report.
This is an excellent idea.
This is quite justifiable.
I support Mr Adam's report.
The decision was the right one.
We still lack half the money we need.
The radioactivity is still there.
Nuclear power is not one of them!
However, such a solution exists.
They are still paying that price today.
That is a reasonable argument.
I remember it well.
Thank you very much, Mrs Gradin.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
I would then support it.
EC - USA competition laws Agreement
There is also another serious issue.
Thank you very much, Mr Sepp√§nen.
We owe them a great deal of gratitude.
If we did, we would be much better off!
Thank you very much, Mrs Gradin.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Thank you very much, Mr R√ºbig.
Mr Manisco has asked for the floor.
You only mentioned two abstentions.
Thank you very much, Mr Manisco.
In any case, this could open a debate.
Please do not clap too soon.
Two opinions have been given.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 11.35 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Tribute
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(Applause from various quarters)
Welcome
Northern Ireland
Mrs Mowlam, you have the floor.
That makes a real difference.
We must never forget that.
It is a unique agreement.
In fact, they are out to destroy it.
I echo your President's words on that.
But there are gains there for everyone.
And she came.
There is a women's centre in Ballybeen.
You have made a difference in the past.
Thank you one and all for your support.
(Loud and sustained applause)
It is deeply appreciated.
(Loud applause)
There is no more noble cause than that.
25 000 jobs have been created.
This has been a big success.
They were moving experiences.
So do I.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Santer.
But we are.
How was it done?
(Loud and sustained applause)
We cannot draw any other conclusion.
Just one note of caution.
We praise those who found the words.
She had an enormous part to play.
War-weariness set in.
Real concessions were made.
There is still a long way to go.
They deserve better than they have had.
The future is in their hands.
It is a bad start.
And why can these people not speak?
They cannot have read it.
But there is one exception.
What is the difference?
Go and tell the widows.
Go and tell the orphans.
This is a serious matter.
(Applause)
Hence the signing of this Agreement.
Mrs Mowlam now has the floor.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Mrs Mowlam.
The debate is closed.
Mr Santer has the floor.
I thank Mr Cot for his question.
We will not interfere in this regard.
That seems clear to me.
Thank you.
We nominated and selected them.
Bravo!
I disagree.
Thank you, Mr President.
Convergence and the single currency
That would be unacceptable.
The Treaty is clear.
The terms of the appointment are clear.
We do not want to create illusions.
Unbelievable, is it not?
We have to be flexible on this point.
This is a highly political decision.
That is the good news.
And no qualifying amendments!
This seem completely impossible to us.
Which view will prevail?
This was not so easy to begin with.
We will have to fill this vacuum.
I will conclude now, Mr President.
These critics have been proved wrong.
I think this has finally been achieved.
We also want to be concrete.
I am very happy with our collaboration.
The debate is closed.
1998 annual economic report
The first of these is growth.
That is not the way we see it.
Without this a great deal can go wrong.
It is, on the contrary, an asset.
Some will say: that is another story.
I only hope the future proves as rosy.
We are following this closely.
This is compared with 4.4 % in 1997.
Europe created 600 000 jobs in 1997.
All of this is not contradictory.
But it will take time.
The debate is closed.
Textiles and the clothing industry
Guidelines were being drawn up.
That is one thing.
This is a dramatic time for the sector.
The fourth issue is child labour.
The debate is closed.
Apprenticeship training in Europe
How can these objectives be promoted?
We need actual workplace experience.
Thank you, Commissioner Flynn.
The debate is closed.
Supplementary pension rights
Sadly, he cannot be with us.
That is dealt with in Article 6 and 7.
All these provisions are important.
What must be important to us is that...
(The President cut off the speaker)
And that is the key point.
This is the start.
Thank you, Commissioner Flynn.
The debate is closed.
Judgments in matrimonial matters
I thank him again for his work.
This has a two-fold effect.
This can have serious consequences.
Thank you, Commissioner Gradin.
The debate is closed.
Aspects relating to world trade
I hope not to repeat them.
This could well be a useful initiative.
European City of Culture
By 20 January it was being translated.
So let us not be naive.
I know that you oppose this.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Mrs Billingham.
That is quite clear.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Absolutely, Mr R√ºbig.
(The Minutes were approved)
Surely not!
But there are other fundamental rights.
It is a simple question of economics.
Piracy must be combated forcefully.
This is an extremely important issue.
The debate is closed.
The internal market in natural gas
This we also find in the directive.
So we are very pleased with this.
That is quite obvious.
We do not want to be obstructive.
But when does competition arise?
What could have been improved?
To do so we need a lot more resources.
I do not think this is right.
Thank you, Commissioner Papoutsis.
The debate is closed.
ALTENER II
In addition, it creates many jobs.
It is environmentally friendly.
Is it a comedy?
It is no comedy; it is tragic.
Domestic waste, I ask you!
That is not renewable energy.
The rest cannot do that.
How can we help renewable energy?
So we will need to support investment.
The technology is there.
What do these words mean?
Nothing in reality.
How did the Council see this?
That subject is renewable energy.
That is an encouraging sign.
(The President interrupted the speaker)
Thank you Mr President.
Thank you, Commissioner Papoutsis.
The debate is closed.
Air pollution by motor vehicles
Thank you, Commissioner Bangemann.
The debate is closed.
Votes
We decided this procedurally.
Mr President, I rise on the same issue.
That is for the explanations of vote.
Other Members have asked to speak.
Vote for my amendment.
That is why I tabled it.
They have done them in advance.
Mrs Green, you are absolutely right.
I will let Mr Hume speak.
We all agree with that.
That is what the House is voting for.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
You need not worry.
Your amendment has been adopted.
This matter is now closed.
It has been confirmed.
Parliament has decided.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Resolution on Northern Ireland
I want them to give them up.
von Wogau report (A4-0130/98)
Those are the words of this House.
Being realistic, we do not agree.
Democratic control is weak.
It is what these countries have chosen.
This is a wise decision.
I am in favour of a single currency.
I voted "Yes' to Maastricht.
The ECB draws its powers from a treaty.
That is not the case with the ECB.
It thus has a free hand.
That cannot go on any longer.
We wanted to approve Amendment No 11.
We voted against it in error.
We are basking in a forced euphoria.
Where are these studies?
Is that so certain?
I cannot support the von Wogau report.
I do not regard that end as desirable.
Democratic control is weak.
Desama recommendation (A4-0140/98)
Castagnetti report (A4-0135/98)
Monfils report (A4-0083/98)
Anastassopoulos report (A4-0136/98)
Ettl report (A4-0134/98)
Gas√≤liba I B√∂hm report (A4-0133/98)
But that is not the worst of it.
But that is not enough.
Pimenta report (A4-0125/98)
That concludes the vote.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 1.05 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
It has not been recorded properly.
Thank you.
We will do that.
(The Minutes were approved)
Composition of Parliament
I congratulate her on her appointment.
The single currency
No amendments may be tabled.
We shall continue.
We succeed by working together.
That, in time, will be our achievement.
(Loud and sustained applause)
This was one of its main objectives.
It is not an end in itself.
Your vote will be an historic one.
I come now to my oral proposal.
(Loud applause)
We can create long-term jobs.
We can safeguard purchasing power.
(Applause)
This is a good thing.
And that too is a good thing.
They did not see eye to eye.
The overall plan had got lost.
There were disputes.
The work was slipshod.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Why go on with EMU then?
There is another moral objection.
We will therefore vote against.
Europe is ready for the euro.
(Applause)
That was ill-advised, Mr President.
Is Italy ready for the euro?
But that will not be the case.
(Loud applause from the extreme right)
That is very important.
History will remember their names.
Mr President, where is Europe?
Finally, the euro is going to exist.
Exactly the opposite has happened.
So, the euro has arrived.
We must now see to it that it works.
For this reason it has our support.
Mr President, today is a day for hope.
But history does not end there.
We have to continue on this path now.
Today we are at Community average.
We need it more than the larger states.
This needs to be the EU's objective.
We are voting in favour.
They were at its inception.
I think the euro will succeed.
Let me say one other thing.
(Loud and sustained applause)
The debate is closed.
Mr President, I will be very brief.
After the euro, we have to make Europe.
I regret this historic event.

This is your victory.
The reasons are as follows:
Facts are facts.
It will never be enough.
They have good reason to be wary.
But politics is the art of reality.
Those who don't won't have to.
It is, above all, a new starting point.
The euro is an instrument.
Saturday, 2 May 1998.
I welcome this unreservedly.
I shall abstain today.
But that is not the case today.
There is nothing to support this hope.
Democratic control is weak.
It is what these countries have chosen.
This is a wise decision.
It's settled!
A German army orchestra is playing.
What are they playing?
The Preussen Gloria.
What else do they want?
We here have forgotten everything.
A currency represents all of that.
This is why you cannot do it.
You have gone beyond our powers.
Let us decide to use it to these ends.
Will there be a green euro?
Public opinion is hostile or resigned.
Which nations?
Where is the democracy?
It is a means to political union.
This is a modern 'March of Folly' .
I could not welcome either outcome.
A Europe of Socialism.
They are right.
Careless?
Anyway, hardly confidence inspiring.
Adjournment of the session
Resumption of the session
Thank you very much.
I shall do so.
Thank you very much, Mr Vallv√©.
I will return to this later.
That creates unnecessary differences.
The debate is closed.
The debate is closed.
That is to miss a number of points.
National laws alone determine this.

I take issue with that.
It interferes with the single market.
I shall limit myself to two examples.
The Council deleted this.
This is my opinion as a lawyer.
Jobs play a role in this too.
What, then, have we pledged to respect?
It is crystal clear and unacceptable.
We cannot condone this.
This could have far-reaching effects.
This was for ethical reasons.
The result will be a market cleansing.
For these reasons, we reject the draft.
I think they should come clean on that.
Now we have a stronger formulation.
Both have good reasons.
But it has not gone far enough yet.
Europe must not be left behind.
No: this is a good text.
That is not true.
This is a patents directive.
This directive is a patents directive.
Mr Pompidou reminded us of that.
We cannot introduce a fourth one.
It would be null and void.
That has not been done.
The reason for that is quite simple.
That is something we should put right.
We must preserve this coherence.
Secondly, concerning the embryo.
That is the first thing.
The debate is closed.
Second banking directive
The greatest uncertainties are twofold.
That is an important matter.
And I think that is how it should be.
That seems wrong to me.
Who is accountable?
Finally, Madam President, two points.
Many thanks, Commissioner Monti.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.45 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Thank you.
Are there any more comments?
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Your comment will also be recorded.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
I have no further information.
Decision on urgency
Thank you, Commissioner.
Control of synthetic drugs
This is the key to our success.
We already know this for a fact.
This seems important to me.
I would like thank him for this.
But certainly not legalization!
On the contrary.
I thank him for his efforts.
That seems obvious but it is not.
It just will not happen.
This is a very serious issue.
But there it is.
The report is before us this morning.
The strategy has so far been effective.
The debate is closed.
All that glitters is not gold.
The debate is closed.
Tobacco advertising
There is a basis.
That is really monstrous, Mr President.
Who is tobacco advertising aimed at?
They put forward legal arguments.
Well, you cannot ignore the facts.
Pleasure is not forbidden.
Prohibition creates delinquency.
Noone would be very keen on that.
We should celebrate it.
No, not everyone, but the majority!
We all agree about the objectives.
Of course we need this.
That is the legal position.
But that is another story.
But what do we see nowadays?
But that is not my concern.
Please accept my apologies.
That is still made up of politicians.


Health, we are all agreed.
So we must act accordingly.
Europe must therefore play a full role.
It has proved effective.
I think we need to act in this way.
So there is a clear message here.
There is clearly a legal problem.
The answer is two things.
I apologise to the interpreters.
Has advertising any importance, then?
This opinion has never been revoked.
But it does not harmonize, it bans.
Mr President, I have a point of order.
I for one doubt it!
Thank you, Mrs Malone.
We have to put an end to that here.
It is this common position or nothing!
I ask you to act accordingly!
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
We can stop these comments here.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Votes
Mr President, I have a point of order.
Moreover, the issue has been covered.
(Mixed reactions)
(Applause)
(Applause from the Green Group)
Mr President, on a point of order.
Could we now move to the vote?
On Amendments Nos 6 and 28
(Applause )
However, your comment has been noted.
It represents a refusal of law.
(Loud applause)
Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you.
It is a good point for us, so carry on!
Many of you know Akin.
On paragraph 8
That is not how it is done.
That is against the rules of the House.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
It all depends.
Wijsenbeek report (A4-0152/98)
Parliament has failed pitifully.
I am grateful for that.
(The President.
No, no!)
That was not referred to at all.
This is a black day for Europe.
All this talk has been proved wrong.
The directive bans cloning.
This has been achieved.
The directive reinforces this rule.
That is to be welcomed.
This would be undesirable.
We need to go more slowly.
My votes registered my concern.
Pirker report (A4-0157/98)
We have to deal with that.
The profit margins are considerable.
Water quality
I am very pleased about this.

(The President cut off the speaker)
I deplore that.
I commend them to the House.
For that I am grateful to Mr Collins.
Thank you for your attention.
I think this is particularly serious.
Does it not stand up to scrutiny?
That is simply incorrect.
The child died.
Thank you, Commissioner Bjerregaard.
The debate is closed.
This is very important.
I still feel that we ought to try this.
The UK has such a threshold.
Now we are talking about percentages.
This seems totally justified.
No, we need uniform standards.
Other action needs to be taken.
They are a major step forward.
This is a positive step.
This is good.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
This would thus not cause a problem.
In general, it is not complied with.
You know that, Madam Commissioner.
It is hardly complied with at all.
The debate is closed.
Eco-label
But what about the issue?
That is something we would appreciate!
We have also tabled such an amendment.
It is visible and reliable.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
We have debated it in this Parliament.
They got more than they needed.
Commissioner, thank you.
You spoke of bright spots.
My questions to you today are these.
That is a positive result.
That is the situation.
Thank you, Mrs Larive.
This is a warning to everyone.
That is wrong.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
You have the floor.
I will be brief, Mr President.
Subject: Sale of drugs via the Internet
These are all clear legal regulations.
But that would not get us much further.
That is not prohibited.
He failed to do that in his answer.
So far it has not been a priority.
I made a factual statement.
Subject: Burden-sharing in staffing
Then we await the reaction.
Subject: Lorry Blockade in France
Thank you very much, Mr Kinnock.
Subject: Rail transport
They want to make use of 40 000 wagons.
Thank you very much, Mr Kinnock.
That concludes Question Time.

Towards a Europe of Knowledge
It is still not bad though!
Paragraph 31 is a very important point.
I am completely in favour of this idea.
The debate is closed.
How do we reconcile these?
These are worthy aims.
They, of course, may fail.
We hope they succeed.
I think these issues must be tackled.
I am thinking of the children.
Will it all work in practice?
What is the role of the European Union?
Parents are rightly concerned.
This was a totally unanimous report.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Interim agreement on trade with Mexico

We will be able to help with this.

We should not disappoint them.
Time will tell.
Of course not.
CONAI is in favour of this agreement.
And it was extremely useful.
We must recognize that fact.
The debate is closed.
Community customs code
Parliament heartily endorses that.
How can the Commission solve that one?
The revised legislation lies before us.
Mrs Peijs requests the floor.
Is it to ask a question?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.44 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Very well.
It will be recorded, Mr Delcroix.
(The Minutes were approved)
Thank you, Mr Falconer.
I have made a note of it.
Thank you, Mrs Green.
And that is rightly so.
This procedure must be changed!
(Applause)
This is a good way forward.
(Applause)
No.
Are we the board of a central bank?
Hardly.
They were all competent individuals.
I rather doubt it.
I am delighted to say that.
In short, a high level of employment.
One has no objection to that.
This we simply cannot accept.
That was my comment.
This is something we cannot ignore.
That is the coward's course.
On that occasion it was in Spain.
Allow me to make one final observation.
The hearings were important.
I look forward to that era.
This is the same the world over.
Applause please!
So he is a most excellent person.
I want to add only two things.
She has a short memory.
This provides the definite answer.
The debate is closed.
That is good.
Will the available money be spent?
So what does the ultra-right want?
To force the United States to withdraw?
We all wish him a speedy recovery.
Thank you, President-in-Office.
That needs to be said straight away.
I now want to make a few quick remarks.
So, what have we done?
Why did we decide to do that?

This seems wrong to me.
That three-month period is now over.
That was my question.
You have had the three-month review.
I will not oppose that.
Votes
Is Mr Duisenberg present?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Please take that into account.
We shall begin the vote.
The text itself is not put to the vote.
(Mixed reactions)
I am becoming shortsighted.
(Parliament adopted the decision)
It was a necessary warning.
Independence with regard to whom?
But we have only been consulted.
I do not think they would.
And I will not tolerate that.
I did so on the grounds of censorship.
Over ECU 1 billion per year!
Our decisions should be more coherent.
Today's vote is a historic vote.
I do not agree.
What about an egg advertising ban?
Or one for cars?
Not to mention alcohol or coffee?
Where should we draw the line?

What about an egg advertising ban?
Or one for cars?
Not to mention alcohol or coffee?
But where will it take us?
In my opinion, we have got it wrong.
Is that what we want?
It only took one year!!
This is also proposed in the directive.
We are all pleased about them.
Peijs report (A4-0149/98)
Pollack report (A4-0161/98)
And this policy is working.
Let us therefore count our blessings!
This is hopeful.
Yet sadly we cannot be solely positive.
Hautala report (A4-0174/98)
Poggiolini report (A4-0119/98)
Whitehead report (A4-0153/98)
But, we must see things clearly.
Hulth√©n report (A4-0162/98)
Perry report (A4-0166/98)
I do not really think it will.
But no figures have been given.
Common defence policy
Then, in 1994 we went up to 15 Members.
This is where we are at present.
That is the big question.
General de Gaulle's European Europe?
Thank you, Mr Tindemans.

Why do we not want to use them?
That will not be the case.
They were said to stand no chance.
Let us never forget this!
Or just the North, South and West?
It is a ludicrous thought.
That is disgraceful.
(Applause from the Green Group )
Such a complement is needed.
This is important.
Look at what happened at Dayton.
I do not want to disappoint you.
This is what he expresses.
(The President cut off the speaker)
It will also need an army.
That is the price of our independence.
Let me settle with him.
It is an immediate priority.
Because what is the question here?
So what does it mean?
What is the objective?
They both amount to the same thing.
In my view that would be a pity!
My country has never been occupied.
Of this at least I am convinced.
Portugal might view this differently.
So I would like to turn it all around.
The debate is closed.
Nuclear tests in India
These are being carried out today.
It is extremely dangerous.
This is an emergency.
Did it condemn France for doing that?
But, we are far from achieving it.
Let us hold meetings.
The whole region is in turmoil.
Look at the reactions from Pakistan.
China, too, has given a heavy response.
The debate is closed.
Agenda
Does anyone have any objections?
Madam President, on a point of order.
Madam President, on a point of order.
Many thanks!
Kosovo
But we reject such claims.
President Milosevic has a clear choice.
The first is to step up the pressure.
We cannot be sure of this, however.
The debate is adjourned.
It will continue this evening.
Question Time (Council)
Mr Sarlis, please listen to me.
You have one minute.
Just a few words, Mr President.
Otherwise, it would not make sense.
Yes, Mr Dupuis.
And we are already behind schedule.
It is a very important issue.
Thank you very much, Mrs Hardstaff.
It is a very obvious point.
Subject: Money laundering
It has been a high-profile issue.
Question No 6 by David Bowe (H-0400/98)
If not, why not?
I will relay them to my colleagues.
Subject: Situation in Palestine
Subject: Harmonized EU eco-labelling
Subject: Common military defence
Thank you for answering my question.
Thank you very much, Mr Henderson.
Subject: Iraq - UN Agreement
Subject: The Iraq embargo
The facility has always been available.
Thank you very much, Mr Henderson.
That concludes Question Time.
I would like to thank Mr Henderson.
I direct this remark to the Council.
We must go one step further.
I do not need to go on.
Last year it was 10 %.
This year there is no negative reserve.
So this is a very serious matter.
Thank you, Commissioner Mar√≠n.
The debate is closed.
Kosovo (continuation)
The debate is closed.
Competitiveness of European industry
A rapid reform is required here.
Structural reforms are required.
My compliments to the rapporteur.
My second point concerns taxes.
This in itself is very positive.
We should continue them.
The man who said that has also gone.
We must now take action.
We have really talked long enough now.
Thank you, Commissioner Bangemann.
The debate is closed.
Electronic commerce
We also require tax harmonization.
My second point is privacy.
This leads me to my last point.
But we must also remove barriers.
How reliable is it?
What happens to electronic money?
It has already been mentioned.
There is a clear message.
Education and skills are vital.
I will repeat them once more.
The situation is complex.
We are in the process of preparing it.
In the Council we have a working party.
We have practically done it already.
We will be able to sort it out.
This is an essential requirement.
Thank you, Commissioner Bangemann.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Commissioner Bangemann.
The debate is closed.
I congratulate him on it.
I will merely go into the issues.
We will then formulate it accordingly.
Thank you, Commissioner Bangemann.
The debate is closed.
Everyone must be willing to compromise.
Thank you, Mr Lannoye.
This is completely clear!
Get rid of 'may contain' .
Why do you want 'may contain' ?
Let them choose.
Have some confidence in the people.
The debate is closed.
(The House rose at 11.38 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
(Applause )
Mr President, 2 May was a historic day.
We are going to support it.
And it did!
His proposals are very useful.
This is a test.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Firstly, economic and monetary union.
Thirdly, employment and social policy.
I must beg to differ with that view.
It cannot change the Treaties.
It is not undemocratic.
This is wholly unacceptable.
This is social dialogue.
Preferably, we should not get involved.
The debate is closed.
Information and communication policy
I must draw your attention to this.
We need good communication channels.
Essentially, the situation is simple.
Who is to convey this message?
We need more money.
Who knows the risks of enlargement?
Who knows our decisions?
As a result, information is achievable.
This ambiguity remains after amendment.
The report goes further, however.
That is not the case.
To a certain extent this is true.
Parliament must vouch for it.
These are just a couple of examples.
What we need is a personal dialogue.
But what does he mean by this?
I do not share this view.
(The President cut off the speaker)
The others will manage just fine.
I support it too.
It is not an easy task.
I share that objective.
The debate is closed.
Welcome
Votes
This is what the President told us.
It has become a pleasant habit.
We take it in good part.
After the vote on Amendment No 18
Are you going to insist, Mr Falconer?
We have a lot of amendments.
Mr Falconer did not start this game!
The game was started by the Bureau.
I have the French text in front of me.
Thank you, Mr Dimitrakopoulos.
This is all that is in paragraph 3.
You did not protest initially.
At the end you can always vote against.
Your attitude is completely stupid.
It is completely contradictory.
I regret we did not have that chance.
That is what happens in such cases.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Madam President, I will be very brief.
But that is the end of it.
On paragraph 9
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Mixed reactions)
That is my first point.
Mr Falconer, I will reply immediately.
I can assure you of that.
(Applause )
Thank you, Mrs Green.
I appreciate what you say.
K. Collins report (A4-0181/98)
Tindemans report (A4-0171/98)
We cannot support the report.
It does no such thing.
It does not need another one.
Do I need to say it again?
Caudron report (A4-0138/98)
E. Mann report (A4-0173/98)
Herman report (A4-0117/98)
That is not our perception.
I share his view entirely.
Topical and urgent debate
That is not, however, enough.
The debate is closed.
This is something we cannot accept.
There has been a study carried out.
It cannot say no to Mochovce.
The debate is closed.
Guatemala
They must not be allowed to succeed.
Colombia
It is not an act of nature.

Peace cannot wait much longer.
We have seen what this can lead to.
We must be on our guard.
Turkey
I think Mr Birdal expected it too.
The military way is no solution.
The violence has got to stop.
Please, Akin, get well soon.
But that is not enough.
It is defended through reasoning.
Malaysia-Indonesia
This is absolutely unacceptable.
Tibet
That is the first point.
Sale of human organs in China
Well, there are 53.
We have to adopt a clear position here.
Thank you very much.
We are still waiting!
For us, the moment to act is now.
Capital punishment in Burma
So we know what this may mean.
What should we do?
Colombia's problem is very simple.
Meanwhile, what should we do?
The joint debate is closed.
What are we gaining?
We are not gaining anything.
The joint debate is closed.
Do√±ana National Park
Italy
I want to make that clear.
The joint debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Votes (continuation)
Yes.
That concludes voting time.
But this is not included in the report.
These are two separate issues.
The report is totally unacceptable.
Competition in the air traffic sector
We believe that is not acceptable.
I commend them to the House.
That is not something we wish to see.
The debate is closed.
Mr President, I shall try to be brief.
Here I agree with the rapporteur.
This is my principal standpoint.
The debate is closed.
Unanimity in the Council is a rarity.
I supported this at the conference.
Similar possibilities apply to animals.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The rapporteur has asked for the floor.
This practice may possibly be unusual.
Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.40 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
It all seems rather arbitrary.
(The Minutes were approved)
Thank you, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
Many Happy Returns, Mrs Schleicher.
Votes
After the vote on the amendments
The Commission has nodded.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Package deals are the norm.
Payment card crime
Both these views are wrong!
That is organized crime.
That is a lot of money!
Both of these initiatives are right.
That would only lead to confusion.
But society does have an interest.
The latter has a decisive advantage.
Today we have 190 in the UN alone.
(Applause)
We believe it is not.
Use of antibiotics in animal food
I have three main requests.
I would mention the term probiotics.
Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
This was and remains a historic event.
What we are dealing with is the past.
There are no amendments.

Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Combined heat and power
What has changed now is the technology.
We have to remove the barriers.
We can wish for anything we like.
However, the advantages are obvious.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 12.00 noon)
Resumption of the session
Tribute
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The President cut off the speaker)
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
I would like to ask a question.
That is an exciting task.
(Applause)
(Applause )
What will you have to show for it?
In France too, jobs for the young.
Mr President, you spoke of red tape.
We must join forces against this.
(The President interrupted the speaker)
Monetary union is now a reality.
That is nonsense.
One last point.
Now there are action plans.
I want to pay tribute to him on that.
We must call Milosevic's bluff.
How should we proceed from there?
That is the fundamental point!
Are we doing it?
No, we are not!
So we have to change things.
What will we change?
That concludes the debate.
It needs to be improved next year.
They say and we pay.
So, what do we settle for?
It is not always the same country.
I think Turkey made a mistake.
The peace process remains in deadlock.
We are dismayed by them.
We will have more power in the world.
They go hand in hand.
That surely cannot be true.
These years are years of transition.
There are obvious priorities.
I would stress a number of items.
I might cite the case of Turkey.
There is a great deal to be said.
I just do not have the time.
That has been true throughout history.
That is a fact.
(The president cut off the speaker)
I, too, concur with this.
Did they change the reality?
The answer is No.
First of all, that is unattainable.
That is up to the Member States.
The debate is closed.
South Africa
Talks are now at a critical stage.
What are the main outstanding issues?
The political commitment is there.
We are still working on the analysis.
Let us be clear.
We need to be generous.
We have a clear part to play.
And, happily, it came to fruition.
That is the nub of the problem.
But the result can be a real agreement.
We need that, Mr President.
The Union must make a generous gesture.
What has the EU done?
We cannot miss that opportunity.
This is not some kind of book-keeping.
We can have whatever asymmetry we want.
Many thanks, Commissioner Pinheiro.
The debate is closed.
Wider competition is also important.
We are dealing with a global market.
We cannot sit on our hands and look on.
With low inflation we can now do that.
Your House has understood this well.
It seems to me more of a local concern.
Many thanks, Commissioner de Silguy.
The debate is closed.
The rapporteur is not yet here.
Thank you very much, Mr Giansily.
What I wanted to do is this.
Why is that so?
That was the arrangement.
One simply consults the bank.
Mr Herman has exceeded his remit.
I would simply like to reassure you.
This is a purely formal interpretation.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I do have my doubts!
That is what I am criticising.
That's not my point!
But that will not change anything.
That is not his Finnish style.
Thank you very much, Mr R√ºbig.
Thank you very much, Mr Viola.
The debate is closed.
Frontier workers
This is an appeal from Parliament.
Europe is trying to coordinate.
I think that is a pity.
Thank you very much, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
And that is the situation.
It is a familiar pattern.
Secondly, the compensation fund.
Thank you for your speech, Mr Flynn.
The debate is closed.
That is fundamental.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Potato starch
Should we get rid of these subsidies?
Why do we think that?
Few alternatives are available.
We get definite value for our money.
These are very important developments.
Thank you very much, Mr Mulder.
Thank you very much, Mrs Cresson.
The debate is closed.
Higher education
It will not lead to any progress.
Thank you very much, Mrs Cresson.
The debate is closed.
Fifth Framework Programme
But they are not reaching everybody.
They are the flagship of Europe.
Thank you very much, Mrs Vaz da Silva.
These worked satisfactorily overall.
We are on the right track.
Thank you very much, Mrs Cresson.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
That is a disgrace!
I am in favour of it.
It is an odd situation.
No, those are the Minutes, Mr Martens.
Thank you, Mr Wijsenbeek.
We shall take note of that.
(The Minutes were approved)
What do these studies say?
We can do better on funds.
Regrettably, I cannot agree to this.
Anything else would be unacceptable.
That is a key sector for our future.
What about the 18 million unemployed?
It works for us.
Then we would be getting somewhere.
We have got to change this situation.
However, one comment needs to be made.
Hampshire is prosperous.
Unemployment is 2 %.
It is a great county with great people.
Unemployment is 20 %.
Why is it so poor?
I thank Mr Viola for his report.
Thank you, Mr Tomlinson.
Votes
(The House approved the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(The House approved the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That is a double refusal.
(Parliament rejected the amendment)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I have objections.
I do not accept the oral amendment.
(More than 12 Members stood up)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That is not my position at all.
The amendments imply:
The EU decides.
But we have seen nothing of the sort.
But time is moving on.
There is no intrinsic value in this.
No!
The structure is fragile.
This is also the case in Sweden.
How long will this go on?
It is more than urgent!
It is vital!
The vote has been a shambles.
This of course has improved in 1996.
This support must be properly balanced.
I therefore support the Viola report.
Thank you for your comment.
We are his humble servants.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 1.00 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Certainly, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy.
The electronic system broke down.
It is a private magazine.
They are fascist thugs!
You are absolutely right, Mrs Mann.
(Interruption by the President )
I am happy to hear this.
So, considering......
(Interruption by the President)
This is not the time.
You can be absolutely certain of that.
I also have a second comment.
(The Minutes were approved)
Calendar of part-sessions 1999
That is my first point.
But we could also vote on Thursday.
Why not?
In that case there is no problem.
Amendment of Rule 48
There is a past history to this report.
Many reports are complex and lengthy.
The debate is closed.
That is why it all started.
My group utterly disagrees with this.
Unfortunately my plane was late.
The PPE Group unanimously supports it.
Bravo, Mrs Aelvoet!
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Genetically modified micro-organisms
The principal points are as follows:
We do not find that satisfactory.
We regret that cannot be done.
(The President cut off the speaker)
This includes the issue of comitology.
This is not acceptable to us, however.
What are specific issues?
Who defines these specific issues?
What can it possibly mean?
The debate is closed.
Humane trapping
Regrettably, Mr Pimenta cannot be here.
Mrs Banotti is speaking in his place.
And very nasty things they are, too.
He does not believe this is correct.
There is no justification for this.
But this overshadows everything else.
Why?
They try to break free.
They tear their own flesh.
The debate is closed.
Agreement with Guinea on fishing
At least, I think, this is a start.
This is very important.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.50 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
And this is the last straw.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
Decision on urgency
I think the President is mistaken.
(Parliament approved urgent procedure)
First of all, the set-aside rate.
(The President cut off the speaker)
On the contrary!
These are Amendments Nos 2 and 3.
I will come to this now.
Like his report they are flawed.
Where do they get this fiction from?
It beggars understanding.
The consequences are far from perfect.
I fully concur with him in this.
We will vote in two ways.
Have you, the Commission, checked this?
Why are you rejecting it?
What will they do?
That is a great difficulty.
I have tabled amendments accordingly.
The EU should be doing the same.
I support this proposal.
Or is it being muzzled intentionally?
I would like to raise a few points.
That does not make sense.
The debate is closed.
It can only help the common good.
Let me be quite clear about this.
We are not saying it is not justified.
That is why we are cautious.
I should therefore like to thank them.
Thank you, Mr Pinel.
Are you listening?
We Socialists see two risks.
Firstly, it is a good report.
Why?
Commissioner, will bread prices fall?
Will beer become cheaper?
What about the price of butter?
Will we be able to expect this?
I should like to recommend this.
Let us be honest about that!
I would like to know the number.
My group will support him.
Here we must make a radical change.
But the report is, of course, global.
How can we do this?
What tools must we use?
And he makes proposals for the future.
They cannot have it both ways.
But they are flawed.
Nor will it be in future.
The debate will continue at 3.00 p.m.
Votes
Gir√£o Pereira report (A4-0178/98)
What do we have here?
Therefore we cannot support it.
Trakatellis report (A4-0192)
des Places report (A4-0216)
We have come such a long way!
It was an important debate.
But now the pews are empty.
I personally do not think so.
Rosado Fernandes report (A4-0218/98)
Tobacco is a poison and a drug.
We do not have any other alternative.
The risks of smoking are considerable.
This is the truth of the matter.
Reform of the CAP (Agenda 2000)
Agenda 2000 extends EU aid to forestry.
We must denounce this here.
Does Agenda 2000 really offer us this?
Small family farms are disappearing.
That is a profoundly unfair policy.
Aid has not been regionalized.
They managed that.
This was necessary.
Allow me to illustrate.
The debate is closed.
2000: Economic and social cohesion
I do want to make two brief comments.
This year, we stand at 1.14 %.
This must be regarded as unilateral.
All of this must be done.
But what are the rules of the game?
Less than a year is not much time.
There are also further amendments.
We will vote on it tomorrow.
Then we will finally have a result.
What is the aim of all this?
It is to achieve a balanced system.
We must work together on this.
We will consider this very carefully.
How?
One is not possible without the other.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Thank you, Mrs McCarthy.
We have all noted your remark.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
If not, why not?
May I urge you to persevere.
Thank you very much, Mrs Wulf-Mathies.
You must look into that.
Subject: Excise duties
Thank you very much, Mr Andersson.
And I want to tell you something else.
This is no longer the case.
Thank you very much, Mr Oreja Aguirre.
He is not with us.
It is a difficult case.
Subject: European Cultural Institutes
That is right and it has my support.
(Interjection from Mr Ephremidis)
But I have not given you the floor.
Why are you speaking?
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
This is roughly the state of affairs.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
We should keep this distinction.
We have an agreement.
So we have an agreement.
Sometimes they may be of more use.
But it is a strictly internal matter.
That is the general context.
Some of them are very complicated.
We had to call in some experts.
It is part of the investigation.
I have two supplementary questions.
This is a general rule.
There is a lack of human resources.
Thank you very much, Mr Van Miert.
That concludes Question Time.
Truly a missed opportunity!
It is high time a change was made.
I am glad Mr Fischler is here.
That is absurd.
The debate is closed.
But what is it all about?
Regulations are fine.
That's great.
What is "serious' supposed to mean?
The debate is closed.
Fifth Framework Programme for RTD
Next I would like to thank the Council.
The first relates to concentration.
The third concerns social innovation.
The fourth relates to growth.
This is the aim of Amendment No 18.
Does it reduce unemployment?
I do not know how we will resolve this.
So, we will not change our minds.
But that is my personal opinion.
I am asking you to reflect on this.
I do not think it is appropriate.
But so be it.
That is irrational behaviour.
We are bringing Europe to the people.
Let me give a simple example.
It cannot be.
The debate is closed.
That is what we wanted, after all.
Nevertheless, it is a contribution.
I will gladly bow to superior wisdom.
Please take that into consideration.
There is a grave difference here.
Each of them is sensible.
We could hope for an energy chapter.
So, let us try for that.
I would like to turn now to Mr Linkohr.
That is absurd.
Of course not.
So I have little to say on this.
But we are facing a classic dilemma.
We talk about it but we do not use it.
What can be done?
This was the issue at Rio and Kyoto.
There are three essential points.
So we have problems in that regard.
The debate is closed.
Counterfeit and pirated goods
Customs officials?
Will they be trained to do so?
This is not a solution.
The debate is closed.
Second WTO ministerial conference
I do not agree with Members on that.
That would be very much appreciated.
The Commission must not limit itself.
Global disparities have worsened.
Things did not turn out that way.
That is just not the case!
(The sitting was closed at 00.35 a.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Please could it be corrected.
The Minutes will be corrected.
That will also be done.
(Parliament approved the Minutes)
I am grateful for your assistance.
I shall pass on your comments.
This is our big problem.
Calendar of part-sessions 1999
(Parliament agreed to this proposal)
Middle East peace process
There is no way around it.
But we have no time for terrorism.
We want to give them our clear support.
That is something we cannot get out of.
Just on whose behalf are they speaking?
Prudence is called for at such times.
So not everything is negative.
I find that extremely difficult.
We also visited the airport.
I find this a pity.
Where has this money gone?
What can we do?
Now is premature!
This, too, I think is useful.
We would then get far more results.
And now to the European Parliament.
I also dispute this.
We all know this.
Why act and intervene only in Kosovo?
Let us use that economic power.
This will be difficult to achieve.
The conditions are, however, clear.
We need courage and vision.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
That is essentially what we are about.
That is quite right.
The gates were locked.
What is its purpose?
This is how peace will be built.
Will the Council accept my regulation?
That is what we think.
Go and visit the airport.
It has been completed.
I have spent ECU 15 million on it.
I knew it was useless.
You tell me: "Spend the money' .
I spend the money.
I am not the one who gives permission.
In short, I am really sorry.
Tell me how to do that.
Some of them have no legal base.
Welcome
(Applause)
Well I do.
At the moment we cannot do so.
That is our opinion.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Votes
I am quite happy to do that.
Yes, there has been a mistake.
I have checked with the services.
This must go to a vote.
(Applause)
Welcome
Votes (continuation)
That is absolutely unacceptable.
I can repeat the electronic check.

It is completely unacceptable practice.
They made a mistake with their votes.
It is unacceptable to recall it.

We cannot accept that.
That cannot be right.
I have the French text:
After the vote on the resolution
This text has been rejected.
We have therefore completed the vote.
Mr Herman, there are votes in sections.
That is what I suggest.
Fair enough, you can request it.
Are there any objections?
Please, let us vote on it now.
Then we will know where we stand.
Mr Linkohr, you are opposed.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
That is an end to the matter.
This system is unnecessary.
What are we to think?
In fact, we already have a directive.
We are opposed to this.
I still have my doubts.
I can understand the reservations.
Situation in Kosovo
Despite their effort, it is not enough.
By we, I mean the European Union.
We are not going to be driven out.
Milosevic is playing with the West.
He is leading us around by the nose.
And we know it.
And we're letting him do it.
That is our problem.
It is a fact.
Shamefully, this time was squandered.
And what condition is that?
However, I wish to make three points.
That is the first issue.
This has been the pattern for years.
That is my first important point.
It is understandable.
But he must not be allowed to succeed.
However, it will not be easy.
But what would we gain by that?
The attacks on Kosovo must be stopped.
You have run a great presidency.
Well done!
That is our main task.
That is the problem.
That is only to be expected.
That is my first point.
Where is the European mediation?
There is not one, it does not exist.
He did not respond at that time.
From Kosovo.
Why does he not want to see him?
We have learned the lessons of Bosnia.
This would be a little too theoretical.
Where should these troops withdraw to?
I must say this quite unequivocally.
We must see things as they really are.
The debate is closed.
It is completely pointless!
In vitro diagnosis
All it means is subsidiarity.
Many thanks, Commissioner Bangemann.
The debate is closed.
Harmful tax competition
I think that we can but agree on this.
That is no longer acceptable.
Levying taxes is a very serious affair.
Yet I am also disappointed.
Some incentives are not transparent.
Has the Commission overlooked this?
Tax policy is one of these areas.
This I fully support.
Other areas must now follow.
It is simply harmful to the market.
We must put a stop to tax erosion.
Question Time (Council)
I am also concerned with these issues.
Question No 6 by Mark Watts (H-0504/98)
I must say your answer astonishes me.
I find it obscene.
Thank you very much, Mr Blak.
I thank Mr Blak for his question.
Thank you very much, Mr Henderson.
I appreciate Mr Blak's sense of humour.
Thank you very much, Mr Henderson.
Subject: Aid to shipbuilding
I shall invite Mr Henderson to reply.
I should like to endorse your comments.
Thank you very much, Mr Henderson.
Thank you very much, Mr Henderson.
This is a really sorry saga.
Nobody was notified of the appeal.
Subject: Autonomy in Northern Epirus
I am very clear on the matter.
Subject: Removing obstacles to trade
Otherwise no actions will be credible.
Thank you very much, Mr Henderson.
Harmful tax competition (continuation)
Thank you, Mr Svensson.
We will take note of this.
I can promise you that.
Cardiff has emphasized this as well.
It is a cautious beginning.
My congratulations to the rapporteur.
It will not stop at coordination.
This is unacceptable!
Its meetings are secret.
That is where the problems lie.
Here, too, we need to keep in step.
That would not be realistic at present.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Tax treatment of private motor vehicles
This draft directive has two aims.
This is a small step in that direction.
The grim reaper strikes only once.
They are far from being solved.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Mobile and wireless communications
I would like to end with a warning.
We agree on that.
Or would you like me to do that?
Rather the other way around!
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Transport of nuclear waste
You have said that there is no risk.
That is not quite true.
So there is a real risk.
You have a standing working group.
You discuss transport matters.
The whole thing is quite inconceivable.
No.
I think not.
Are there lessons to be learned?
Yes - there needs to be more openness.
I think that is regrettable.
Could we have some answers please?
This debate seems long overdue.
That is my first point.
You are the guardians of the law.
That is the real scandal of the matter.
But he can never prove it later!
Those are the facts.
You just have to read your own papers!
It is important.
Mr Lange has already mentioned Lenin.
And that is just the point!
When are they ever going to learn?
Finally it might just see the light.
Yes, certainly.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Thank you very much, Mr Guti√©rrez.
It will be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
(Loud applause)
The next item is the joint debate on:
Mrs Malone wishes to speak.
There seem to be a lot of vacant seats.
Perhaps we could ring the bells.
Mr Blair has the floor.
It is not.
First of all, employment.
Thirdly, the single market.
The screening process is underway.
It is an ambitious timetable.
That is a major step forward.
I am grateful for your support.
We need economic and political reform.
I believe in the European ideal.
I consider it a privilege.
(Loud and sustained applause)
Thank you, Prime Minister.
I thank you very much for that.
You are very welcome, Tony.
The euro is launched.
We have heard many of those words here.
We are keen to solve them.
(Applause )
Welcome back United Kingdom!
It is to safeguard the Treaty.



Well, everyone is against that.
So who do they criticise?
I can see three possibilities.
I welcome this.
I hope actions will follow swiftly.
(Applause)
We welcome the change of tone.
That is very worthwhile.
There were also some non-decisions.
That was welcomed at the time.
Their behaviour is welcome now.
(Applause )
We are not ignorant of the reasons.
The vote will take place at 12.00 noon.
I wish to highlight two things.
Thanks to Europe's best-fed ghost.
What is in this letter?
I could go on.
So the hunt is on for scapegoats.
There were no reasons for this.
Our rights must be further extended.
My fourth point concerns Agenda 2000.
How do we make it more effective?
Spread the vote to the majority.
We should endorse this.
However, there are deficiencies too.
So there are a lot of things wanting.
We did.
We contacted them very fully indeed.
We did not really follow it.
I do not believe that is the way to go.
They left the Labour Party.
That is not my idea of democracy.
We have agreed a timetable.
It is difficult and it will take time.
I am actually optimistic about Europe.
We need not be frightened of reform.
We should welcome and embrace it.
(Loud and sustained applause )
Most certainly I do.
Votes
I agree with you.
One vote will suffice.
Paragraph 18:
This was confirmed at 9.00 p.m.
We cannot withdraw these paragraphs.
We have the same problem.
On that basis, the text was signed.
There has been a misunderstanding.
Let us accept that and move on.
I want to be sure of that.
That is exactly right.
They will still be voted upon.
So I missed the vote but I was present.
Amendment No. 7 :
You have a point, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy.
I accept your request for a split vote.
Amendment No 8 :
Cunha report (A4-0219/98)
This would please us enormously.
Schroedter report (A4-0210/98)
This would be unjust and unfair.
I have voted in favour of the report.
I take the opposite view.
We agree entirely with this.
This is not our position.
Let us face it, not a lot.
This proposal amounts to an insult.
I support it fully.
Pompidou report (A4-0225/98)
Camis√≥n Asensio report (A4-0221/98)
Europe is not lagging behind.
Watson report (A4-0217/98)
Double taxation is unjust and unfair.
However, more needs to be done.
Topical and urgent debate
So much is clear.
Sanctions are not the answer here
The right mediator must be found.
That includes non-proliferation.
Atomic weapons are still here.
They have to accept that.
Welcome, Madam!
We might have been a bit firmer.
In Asia overwhelming enthusiasm.
Where is the Western protest here?
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Moratorium on the death penalty
I think it is important.
It is a specific initiative.
These are not idle words.
That has now changed.
It is a disgrace that this happens.
All the other murders go unpunished.'
Equatorial Guinea
Which governments urged him to do so?
We are now demanding that they do.
The dictator has fallen.
More is, of course, needed.
This has to be investigated as well.
It is an appalling situation.
Chad:
Today they are joined by Chad.
This time there is a different reason.
Pakistan:
So we face a serious situation.
Guinea-Bissau:
But, like Janus, poverty is two-faced.
Thank you, Commissioner Cresson.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Thank you, Commissioner Cresson.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
These are achievements.
Mr Goerens has already mentioned this.
The Union should be quite explicit.
Thank you, Commissioner Cresson.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Votes (continuation)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
We therefore vote against this report.
I cannot endorse this solution.
Situation in the Middle East
Situation in Kosovo
That is a scandalous notion.
Both are high-quality products.
I particularly welcome this.
This is what I have suggested.
I believe that approach to be flawed.
That is one point.
That is how to cultivate a stock.

Otherwise it is not worth very much.
The report has made this clear.
This situation is no longer tenable.
These reports have been useful.
We have to be careful.
Industrial fishing really is an extra.
Mr Kindermann talked about salmon.
We have a problem with wild salmon.
This must naturally be stopped.
We hope this trend will continue.
The latter must always take precedence.
We should give it our support.


Thank you, Mrs Bonino.
The debate is closed.
Market policy can provide answers.
These are very important aspects.
We must encourage quality policies.
What exactly does that mean?
I have nothing really to add to that.
That sets limits on what is possible.
We can and must be able to control it.
Take the subject of funds, for example.
Like you, I do not have a clue.
I do not really need help here.
So, there you have the guidelines.
Thank you, Mrs Bonino.
Thank you, Mr Varela.
(The sitting was closed at 8.55 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
The answer is quite simple.
I hope this allays the House's concern.
(The Minutes were approved)
Votes
What are these technical measures?
Does the latter explain the former?
Kindermann report (A4-0201/98)
McCartin report (A4-0204/98)
But what does the rapporteur propose?
What would be left of the COM?
One can but wonder.
Market in oils and fat
(The President cut off the speaker)
One moment!
Quiet please!
I hope that today we all realize this.
Why two measures and two yardsticks?
So does the Commission.
I am basically in favour of this idea.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mr Colino Salamanca has the floor.
I would like to remind you of it again.
Are there any objections to this?
Mr Fantuzzi wishes to speak.
Thank you, Mr Fantuzzi.
Mr Dell'Alba wishes to speak.
(Parliament rejected the request)
Mr Pasty wishes to speak.
Commissioner, please listen to me.
Set-aside requirement
At the time, no objections were raised.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mr Souchet has the floor.
We are not debating this matter.
This has proved successful!
This is a strange way to behave.
This ideology is reprehensible.
Apple trees are being pulled up.
Milk production is being restricted.
There is constant rationing everywhere.
We are giving up markets.
We are not exporting.
What has caused this inconsistency?
What is happening?
ACP suppliers of bananas
Before the vote on Amendment No 31
The committee proposes ECU 500 million.
But was this not retracted, Mr Liese?
Then that will be explicitly recorded.
The same thing applies to oilseeds.
Mr Nassauer wishes to speak.
(Applause)
(Parliament approved the request)
TACIS programme
Mrs Karamanou wishes to speak.
(Parliament approved the request)
Electronic communication
I will put this request to the vote.
Information society
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 12.43 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Thank you, Mrs G√ºnther.
We will look at it immediately.
It is a historic day.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
There is a matter of principle here.
Thank you.
I should like to raise one point.
This is now the next sitting.
They will be dealt with in Strasbourg.
(The Minutes were approved)
Welcome
Court's ruling in Case C/106
This will be done.
Suspension was the only choice we had.
I agree with this statement.
Can you give us a guarantee of that?
Who is affected by your decision?
We must follow that decision now.
But we must review everything.
I am afraid that your target is wrong.
We must be extremely clear about this.
We are trying to clarify every case.
This time that did not happen.
You are right when you say that.
That is why we must take it seriously.
The Council has not accepted.
There are plenty of initiatives.
But now we need a solution.
So, our position has been questioned.
We need to get them through.
Internal actions will need the same.
We cannot have it any other way.
I fully agree.
We must try to convince them.
And thirdly, ...
We work on this basis.
So that basis does not exist.
Thank you, Mr Liikanen.
This matter is closed.
Mr Telk√§mper wishes to speak.
(The President cut off the speaker)
But what about Egypt?
This is a sign of great willingness.
This is not acceptable!
This is too contradictory.
The debate is closed.
Urban environment
So where is our vision?
This is simply not good enough.
We want real solutions for real issues.
We want to see that promoted.
I believe that begins now.
There are many bees, but one flight.
And permit me one last comment.
Why do we need planning?
Both were left out of the Treaty.
We are only partly in favour of this.
I think not.
And how should we deal with this?
But will this be enough?
This is an excellent initiative.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Are we up to the challenge?
They also mention funding.
Let us take Brussels, for example.


The debate is closed.
Ad hoc procedures for 1999 budget
Much has been said about the reserve.
One comment on the legal basis.
That goes without saying.
This amendment was rejected.
Thank you, Mr Pinheiro.
The debate is closed.
Vendor control systems
(The President cut off the speaker)
That is what I think anyway.
The controls are slack in many ways.
We should not forget the environment.
Who will benefit?
Duty-free is not going.
I will give you a prime example.
It is high time people recognized that.
Please stick to the issue.
Who is going to pay the bill?
Airports?
The airline and shipping companies?
The consumer?
Thank you for those concluding remarks.
The debate is closed.
I am most grateful for that.
Will it all work in practice?
I commend this report.
The debate is closed.
Citizenship of the Union
There is much to be done.
France has done so already.
Good examples always come from the top.
The timing could not be better!
But we must not fool ourselves.

What is it all about?
Where does it say that?
The debate is closed.
Safe use of the Internet
What is special about the Internet?
That is the real problem.
That would reflect the real world.
That is how it really is.
It is quite a simple matter then.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Combined goods transport
So what do we consider important here?
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.50 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Transnational trade union rights
Thank you, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
I could phrase this loosely.
Thank you very much, Mr Sch√§fer.
Thank you, Mr Pinheiro.
Voluntary organizations and foundations
I would like to emphasize three things.
So this is a good start.
Congratulations!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Working time directive
That is all for that quote.
So, we have to know who are involved.
Consultation has to be genuine.
That has to be welcomed.
Those are my main points.
We propose to do that.
This will include doctors in training.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 11 a.m.
Fair trade
This calls for comment.
However, we still have a few problems.
I can but agree with that.
But it is not enough.
Currently, that is not possible today.
In this form the report is a good idea.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at voting time.
Votes
Is that what her amendment is?
Is that how it is?
Then we are in total agreement.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Fontaine report (A4-0232/98)
Aelvoet recommendation (A4-0165/98)
Schmid report (A4-0234/98)
It is urgent !
Very urgent !
Pollack report (A4-0177/98)
This has to be done at local level.
Napoletano report (A4-0172/98)
Belenguer report (A4-0206/98)
D√ºhrkop D√ºhrkop report (A4-0256/98)
This affair is a fine example.
Garosci report (A4-0230/98)
De Clercq report (A4-0205/98)
What is citizenship of the Union?
It means little to the citizen.
These are issues of a different sort.
Has this debate been clearly stated?
No.
We cannot accept this logic.
Democracy requires proximity.
Is it necessary to give examples?
To me, the answer is a clear no.
Oomen-Ruijten report (A4-0095/98)
You never know!
Everyone must have a chance.
This judgement is an aberration.
Ghilardotti report (A4-0203/98)
Chanterie report (A4-0229/98)
In Belgium they can.
Europe is not working!
We have to move away from this.
Fassa report (A4-0198/98)
That concludes voting time.
Adjournment of the session

Resumption of the session
Tribute
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Order of business
The next item is the order of business.
Monday and Tuesday:
Mr Schulz has the floor.
That is not possible today.
Thank you very much, Mr Schulz.
Does anybody wish to speak in favour?
Fine.
Mrs Aelvoet requests to speak.
Mrs Lulling is asking for the floor.
Do you wish to speak for or against?
I am against this.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
Mrs Green is half right.
That is our job.
(Parliament approved the proposal)
This should put the record straight.
That is not what matters now.
I have read the article.
This should be done this week.
Mr President, on a point of order.
(Applause)
Mr President, on a point of order.
Thank you very much, Mr Hallam.
It is fully within its rights.
Admission of third-country nationals
This also raises concerns.
Access must be regulated.
Let us not bury our heads in the sand.
I ask you to show such solidarity.
They are living in the past.
I would like to live in a democracy.
I will therefore discuss three points.
This is also a type of development aid.
Is that not wrong?
I hope it will be supported, of course.
We must be humane, fair and reasonable.
I deal with many of their problems.
Secondly, we must be strict.
This is often the case, by the way.
So what is going on?
Why do we have it?
Because we are an immigration zone.
These are controversial questions.
But we still have different rules.
I do not agree with that.
The debate is closed.
It is important to establish this.
Hence my preference for 'challenge' .
Why not?
It is not helpful in my view.
It is a case of perverted religion.
Another example is relativism.
No state is neutral: take Europe.
We have therefore made a choice.
I have looked through the report.
Tolerance is an obvious starting point.
I think that is already happening.
The debate is closed.
I should like to thank her for that.
Siberia certainly needs the money.
That should continue to be the case.
The Commission shares this view.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.50 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Aid for Bosnia
And it wants to go on doing so.
Fully participate in them.

I am not na√Øve.
The time is up, I think.
Several decades have now passed.
Entire regions depend on them.
This is an industry with a future.
What are the solutions?
Do not let us forget that.
Thirdly, the social dimension.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12.00 noon.
What does the EFC do?
This must not happen.
I have a word of warning for the ECB.
I cannot follow this reasoning.
They duplicate Ecofin.
Unfortunately, this has not happened.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12.00.
There are many barriers.
They employ most of the workers.
However, I have some criticisms.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12.00 noon.
Electoral procedure
What does this mean?
A few steps have been taken.
A wider political base is necessary.
But it needs to be done.
I am too.
Votes
I thank the Commissioner.
Dybkj√¶r report (A4-0231/98)
Oostlander report (A4-0328/98)
It was confused.
I am glad it has been rejected.
Our Parliament lacked courage.
Nor is the word fundamentalism defined.
That is the wrong approach.
We are directly opposed to this report.
Karamanou report (A4-0179/98)
Ribeiro report (A4-0224/98)
That is also the case here.
Ber√®s report (A4-0264/98)
Tappin report (A4-0196/98)
That concludes Voting Time.
Electoral procedure (continuation)
This is of course an old issue.
I think that is extremely important.
Why?
Secondly the percentage hurdle.
Now two more fundamental issues.
We agree with him.
That seems the right way to me.
I think a different way is best.
That seems to be quite irrelevant.
Why so?
I do not know.
How odd.
But they have nothing to fear.
This report does that.
But others have not.
It really is beautifully simple.
It does not exist!
Will it ever exist?
This is unacceptable.
That is a job for the parties.
There is only national democracy.
Europe is not a nation.
It means concentrating decision-making.
I would just like to make four points.
This issue is very important.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
But the Council knew this.
We had no choice.
It was a case of "like it or lump it' .
But I acquiesced in the result.
It is a bad outcome.
Nowadays, such words invite ridicule.
But this programme must go on.
The debate is closed.
Food additives
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is an antibiotic.
My last point concerns Amendment No 7.
What guidance do we use?
Do we use our own judgement?
I will therefore be brief.
These are the three criteria.
This is perfectly possible.
We simply cannot do this!
Labelling is a general issue.
Both must be labelled.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
That we shall endeavour to preserve.
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
Subject: LEADER II programme in Spain
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Why?
But why is it blocked?
Before 1996 it was practically nil.
I therefore cannot answer a question.
Thank you very much, Mr Fischler.
Subject: Own resources
I am studying the matter.
Subject: Family policy studies
Of course I will do what he says.
Thank you very much, Mr Flynn.
Subject: Common Fisheries Policy
Subject: Twelve mile fishing limits
However, it did not say very much.
That is the first point.
I can answer two of those points.
But that is the most I can say.
Maybe I can give a personal assurance.
That is my personal view at this stage.
Subject: Ban on drift-net fishing
The answer is yes.
It is having great problems.
Thank you very much, Mrs Bonino.
That concludes Question Time.
Towards sustainability
It was just not good enough.
It was difficult at the start.
Naturally, the result is a compromise.
So what have we achieved?
They cannot do it alone.
Once again, I thank everyone involved.
That, also, is Europe.
This would certainly not happen.
She deserves every praise for this.
None of this is in the outcome.
Thank you, Commissioner Bjerregaard.
The debate is closed.
Epidemiological surveillance
Parliament had long called for this.
This is Amendment No 13.
This is Amendment No 4.
That suspicion has proved well founded.
It really is an important evening.
I thank you for you support.
Thank you, Commissioner Flynn.
The debate is closed.
Women's health
Frau Heinisch.
I was disregarded earlier.
I do not understand this discussion.
Environmental taxes and charges
Research can be a great help here.
We have many unsolved problems.
I understood quite otherwise.
Madam President, this is a good report.
Thank you, Commissioner Bjerregaard.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.35 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Welcome
Programme of the Austrian presidency
Mr Sch√ºssel has the floor.
We have to be honest with our citizens.
Enlargement has a cost.
Do we have too many Councils now?
The institutions must not be weakened.
I will go even further.
It is very interesting indeed!
Just imagine that!
The Budget Council is on Friday.
Things are very different now.
That is our task.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Sch√ºssel.
Three urgent priority issues await you.
Your third urgent task is enlargement.
The first is enlargement.
(Applause)
The way it wraps things up!
Europe is hungry for democracy.
That is the sort of cooking we like!
So please dish up something better!
Bon appetit!
This is an excellent choice.
The final whistle will blow in May!
After that, time is up.
(Applause) But you did not get it done.
Well, that is something at any rate.
Thirdly, I will mention subsidiarity.
We need a sort of economic government.
(Applause)
But that alone is not enough.
I welcome that.
Austria, I call on you to do something!
Please remember the elderly!
What you do not sow, you cannot reap!
It needs to be recovered.
I do not expect these to be effective.
Technically, a great deal is possible.
It is a very important task.
That is your homework!
(Applause)
I would like to make one more point.
I am just finishing, Madam President.
I greatly appreciated that.
I very much appreciate that.
Let us prepare it!
Who do we make them with?
Children need a healthy environment.
We are proud of that, too.
How do you achieve that?
What else do we need?
What else do we need?
A social dialogue!
I wish to highlight two aspects.
And so it goes on!
Now to the question of employment.
And I will tell you quite plainly why.
The only country!
We want to begin in exactly this way.
Mr Klaus H√§nsch quoted Wallenstein.
This fascinating debate is now closed.
Situation in Kosovo
Klaus Kinkel was there in person.
This is an important point.
Nobody knows exactly what this means.
(Applause)
Welcome
Situation in Kosovo (continuation)
This should not surprise us.
We should not be drawn into this game.
Time is literally running away from us!
Everyone must know this.
No, we failed.
'In Kosovo it was calm.'
The Union exists for us as individuals.
We have numerous resolutions.
Finally, I have a few comments.
We say no, no and no!
That has to be a key element.
That is impossible!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Votes
On Amendment No 8 by the Green Group
I agree with you, Mr President.
Before the final vote
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I agree totally with Mr de Vries.
Welcome
Votes (continuation)
We must vote on this!
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Dybkj√¶r report (A4-0275/98)
Cabrol report (A4-0276/98)
Breyer recommendation (A4-0242/98)
This is the reality of the matter.
Anastassopoulos report (A4-0212/98)
There is not.
We really have to look at this again.
It is a major mistake.
Not at all.
This is not my opinion.
These are the principles.
What of the concrete realization?
Let us not be under any illusions.
So I have voted in favour of the text.
Olsson report (A4-0200/98)
It did not work!
To achieve justice, it did not work!
EMI annual report
On TARGET, a pricing policy was agreed.
If so, which aggregate will it be?
And over what period will this be?
And we want to say so.
Why express these reserves?
How does the ECB handle such a dilemma?
Much the same is happening now.
Is that not a bit overdone ?
The debate is closed.
It expires at the end of this year.
A process has been discovered.
What can be done?
I only mean this part.
Thank you, Mrs Hautala.
The debate is closed.
Now we have a chance to improve things.
The issue of the ramps is a vital one.
And to a large extent it will continue.
Meat is not affected by travel.
So I know what a ramp is.
That is what we are addressing today.
That is difficult.
But we will get there.
There are decent hauliers as well.
That would be out of the question.
This is not very impressive.
That is fine.
Forget your hydraulic loading ramps!
It is about people, not vehicles.
So there is really no point.
It simply does not have the staff.
This is crucial!
As producers, we desire good treatment.
That is as far as it goes.
That is not up for debate here.
Please allow me a further comment.
Now for the report itself.
We cannot accept the others.
Firstly, there is type-approval.
Then there is the gradient.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
Such consideration has not been given.
I would like to have a reply to this.
This document is not yet available.
This has not been done.
It would satisfy me.
Could you clarify this point?
It makes no difference.
You have the floor, Mr Crowley.
I have nothing further to add to this.
I would like a response on that point.
In a word, yes.
That is my first point.
Mr President, on a point of order.
But it is not a point of order.
Subject: Return of the Elgin marbles
The issue is a purely bilateral one.
Subject: Crisis in Sudan
Subject: Protection of minorities
Here I must cite Article 128.
You mentioned the LINGUA programme.
I greatly appreciate that.
What is this about?
This is provided for in the Treaties.
Why are they playing this game with us?
Why?
Why are you avoiding this?
What are you concealing?
There is nothing I can do about that.
That is the basis of the agreement.
My group will approve the resolution.
Let us make a compromise.
That would be one example.
Why?
Thank you, Mr Janssen.
The debate is closed.
Why has this happened?
Why do we have this result?
(The President cut off the speaker)
However, we will have to see.
What future would we see then?
We are going to do so.
Here, a similar situation is presented.
This is totally logical.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The second concerns tax treatment.
Of course I regret this.
I believe you have taken on too much.
Thank you.
Nothing has been said about people.
Now I am slightly irritated.
I considered this to be only practical.
This must not be allowed.
A great deal can be done about this.
Then it happens all at once.
That does not exist at this time.
The first is citizenship.
There is a follow-up to these actions.
It is, therefore, a modified request.
I suspect she is Finnish.
It is important to remember that.
Thank you, Commissioner Flynn.
The debate is closed.
You have the right to do so after all!
Why in another country?
This is why we need this directive.
No, we are only simplifying the rules.
What do we propose?
The second is an essential factor.
We set a time limit.
We hear of delays of up to eight years.
This is an important directive.
That is true, Mr Casini.
I am in favour of integration.
And why?
We should all be pleased with this.
We will therefore support them.
The second reason is institutional.
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.
The debate is closed.
Building a sustainable Europe
This is a very bitter pill to swallow.
It is they who are making demands.
That is where the challenge lies.
This is very pleasing.
The environment is transverse.

All this would save money.
Thank you, Commissioner Bjerregaard.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 00.05 a.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Naturally we will rectify that.
We will correct that.
(Parliament approved the Minutes.)
This man was 58 years old.
Mr Morris has the floor.
Madam President, on a point of order.
It is an important one.
Mrs Ferrer has the floor.
That is how we will proceed.
Mr Smith has the floor.
That is an important objective.
I wish to refer briefly to Sellafield.
However, that praise is qualified.
Immigrant groups will also benefit.
We have our official languages.
This concerns us.
What will happen after that?
We must, therefore, be serious.
That is all I wanted to say to you.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12.00 noon.
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you, Ombudsman.
There would have been an error there.
I also welcome the Commissioner.
I commend this report to the House.
It means many things.
Thank you very much, Mrs Thors.
This clarifies the Ombudsman's mandate.
We can only underwrite this complaint.
However, this year is no ordinary year.
So that is terribly important.
The debate is closed.
Votes
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Madam President, on a point of order.
Hautala report (A4-0253/98)
That is good.
What is the main purpose here?
Rothley report (A4-0267/98)
And that is exactly what is happening.
We have quite simply acted too late.
Is it really necessary?
Four√ßans report (A4-0263/98)
I dare to hope that they will be kept.
Among other things, it says:
We do of course support these demands.
Manzella report (A4-0271/98)
It would appear that the answer is no.
Well done, Mr Manzella.
Frischenschlager report (A4-0257/98)
A "Europe √† la carte' is unacceptable.
Weiler report (A4-0269/98)
The problem is minimal.
It must be a Europe of the people.
Hulth√©n report (A4-0233/98)
We know that.
Mr President, I am very disappointed.
Topical and urgent debate
That development is welcome.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
However, we need to go a lot further.
It was, however, also long overdue.
The effect has been amazing.
Clearly this is something we welcome.
Belarus is part of the European family.
Nobody wants it to be isolated.
One of the speakers mentioned Russia.
Would he please answer it now?
Togo
Why?
Guinea-Bissau
That is the wish of the ARE Group.
Constitutional order must be restored.
Burma
The opposition is also suffering.
This simply did not happen.
An economic boycott is needed.
The European Union must make a stand.
We can do more.
The Thai Government, too, could help.
Sudan
We simply cannot get things moving.
Then we can start to rebuild.
That is the first step.
I can add nothing to this.
Situation in Georgia and Abkhazia
Well, really!
The Georgians have demonstrated this.
Vietnam
This is important.
This is urgent.
Please give me an indication.
That is my question.
Many thanks, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I have been with the homeless families.
They will now see who they can rely on.
Time is short.
However, we must define our terms.
Earthquake in Turkey
Turkey suffers from earthquakes.
Forest fires in Greece

My colleagues have done that very well.
I would just like to say two words.
What remains for us to do?
Many thanks, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
That is the point!
(Loud applause)
Their honour also must be restored.
What follows remains unchanged.
I ask the Members to please rise.
Votes
It was for Parliament to decide that.
You had no choice, Mr President.
Newman report (A4-0258/98)
Thors report (A4-0265/98)
We do believe in it.
We cannot accept Amendment No 1.
The debate is closed.
It must.
They are ignored by the Member States.
The debate is closed.
Security of electronic communications
This brings me to my second point.
Indeed, there is need for action.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.45 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
So my point was different.
May I ask that this be rectified?
That is my question to you.
That is what we should be demanding.
I have taken note of that.
Today is the last part-session.
(The Minutes were approved)
Votes
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I enthusiastically support this report.
Howitt report (A4-0214/98)
Orlando report (A4-0222/98)
Elchlepp report (A4-0227/98)
The economic effects were devastating.
Macartney report (A4-0249/98)
The Council must remain in charge.
Fight against crime
There will be investment in training.
Why?
This is extremely worrying.
It is a timely one.
Not to do so would be a mistake.
I am very concerned about this.
We must be careful not to go too far.
How is it with this then?
Thank you, Mr Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to vote.
Before the vote on Amendment No 13
There is no doubt about that.
It is downright scandalous.
(Applause)
We should remember this.
But we got it.
Thank you, Mr Kerr.
It is one that I sincerely decline.
Thank you, Mr Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to vote.
Fishing off the Comoros
That is just for the record.
These are very poor people.
I have serious doubts about this.







(Applause)
Mr Kinnock, you have the floor.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
That is what I wanted to her to know.
Thank you, Mrs van Dijk.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Tribute
Order of business
The next item is the order of business.
Mrs Theato has the floor.
(Applause from the right)
(Applause from the right)
Now to the more serious matter.
That is all, Mrs M√ºller.
Mr Crowley has the floor.
Thank you very much, Mr Crowley.
(The order of business was adopted)
Third country aircraft safety
He has really done a very good job.
Suspicion is not enough for me.
This is in fact my greatest concern.
The statistics are rather frightening.
The debate is closed.
Legal protection of designs
So this is not a trivial matter.
It merely postpones a solution.
Has this been achieved?
I also have even more components firms.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Coffee and chicory extracts
So that is our intention.
The debate is closed.
Transatlantic relations/Echelon system
That is not so.
You will be aware of the disputes.
I am quoting from the agreements here.
Mr Bangemann mentioned this just now.
No doubt he will do so later.
Or for parliamentary oversight?
Mr Bangemann made no mention of this.
But it served to provide a balance.
And what of democracy?
Democracy is very relative.
And what of freedom?
But there are many negative elements.
There is talk of partnership.
And why not?
Such a situation is defensible.
There is no shortage of examples.
It was a priority question.
So much for that point.
You can read what I said afterwards.
That was our purpose from the outset.
At least, I cannot recall hearing any.
Let us now turn to Echelon.
We know nothing about this.
That is the first point.
That is absolutely clear.
We do not have that knowledge.
I am not hiding in any way.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
He had nothing to say on the subject.
He did not know anything about it.
This is simply unacceptable.
Thank you.
Are there any other comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Amendment of Financial Regulation
Let us look at the details.
However, this is the umpteenth update.
No one really knows.
We are very far from that situation.
It is absolutely urgent.
There is no political logic here.
There is no problem, I will do so.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Draft budget for 1999
What does this budget tell us?
Firstly, on agriculture.
The situation here is far worse.
I would be glad if this were so.
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office.
That is my personal view.
There were four areas.
There is certainly no doubt about that.
(Applause)
We have two in Scotland.
The problem, as I see it, is this.
That is how it entered the equation.
I want to emphasise this.
We are in fact on the right track.
Today, we have the result.
Parliament works fast.
That's the way it should be!
(Laughter and applause)
In the end we got the proposal through.
We have seen various studies.
This is the whole point.
That should not happen again.
They would prefer to abolish mobility.
There have been some improvements.
In other words, we have won.
I shall not repeat him.
Of course, the derogation clauses hurt.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
VOTES
We must not be frightened by this.
Lange report (A4-0314/98)
Hautala report (A4-0313/98)
They are now to be made binding.
So far, so good.
Climate change
Let me just mention four milestones.
What do we want from Buenos Aires?
Wecreated it after all.
What is open for negotiation?
This is not clear at the moment.
Who will do the negotiating?
So far this has not occurred.
By the year 2010 it will be 40 %.
I find the current proposal absurd.
It really is high time to take action!
And that is where I have my doubts.
You can check up on all of this.
I am only referring to your own data.
It would be worth it!
That is left completely unresolved.
We could adopt the easy way.
We must take some of them ourselves.
We do not have a great deal of time.
This close cooperation continues.
I have even read it.
In Kyoto you proposed a ratio of 50/50.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
So much for the essentials.
I am therefore against this amendment.
In any event, I am opposed to it.
Thank you, Mr President.





This is a very difficult issue.
That I understand.
I contend that it is.
What about subsidiarity?
Mr Gahrton takes us a long way.
So I think this is a good step.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I do not in any way wish to judge.
That is not our view.
That is not the position.
My question is to Mrs Bjerregaard.
I am very sorry.
I will not go into those.
The debate is closed.
Civil subsonic jet aeroplanes
I have three further comments.
This is an important issue.
This first step is very welcome.
Two strategies are possible.
One is quiet aircraft.
Let me give you an example.
I live in Limburg.
And what happens?
So what do we have to do?
The debate is closed.
Waste management
What are we going to do about it?
That may not work either.
It will be very difficult.
In my opinion, this is a good idea.
This situation cannot continue.
You are quite right, Mr Herman.
The situation here is truly dramatic.
But how are we to achieve this?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Subject: Voting rights for EU citizens
My question is very simple.
That is the objective.
At this stage, I do not know.
Subject: Burma
This has still not happened.
Subject: Christians in East Timor
That debate is, in fact, still open.
Subject: Cambodia
I do not believe that they were.
I hope it still thinks so.
Subject: Safer car fronts
Subject: Malicious telephone calls
Thank you, Mr Bangemann.
Subject: EU membership and EMU
That is the situation of Sweden.
It has a monopoly of monetary policy.
What is a country's budgetary policy?
What is its monetary policy?
What are the wage trends?
That is how markets operate.
Subject: Denominating EURO banknotes
This needs to be discussed.
We are not here to conceal the truth.
Subject: EMU - 'A new Berlin Wall'
Why?
That concludes Question Time.
Comitology
Firstly, transparency.
Next, democratic control.
The first point is simplification.
That is the political point.
The Commission has produced a text.
This is not what has happened at all.
Why are we protesting so vigorously?
And what do the rules say?
Not for anything.
That is not sufficient for us.
That is not unusual.
One might think that is logical.
There are three or four main reasons.
Parliament has no equivalent right.
It is not quite good enough.
Let the other institutions understand.
That may well happen again.
Thank you, Mr Barton.
The debate is closed.
Supervision of insurance undertakings
They do not produce any risk factors.
My group welcomes this report.
So what is the aim of this text?
What means are used?
We now come to the amendments.
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.
The debate is closed.
Islam and Averro√´s European Day
Not surprisingly he was persecuted.
His works were often banned.
Once again I thank the rapporteur.
How is that?
And that would be a great pity.
Where are the churches in Saudi Arabia?
Are there 100 or 10, is there even one?
Your initiative was certainly timely.
It was much more.
Thank you, Commissioner Oreja.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11 p.m.)
Welcome
What are the causes?
The second point concerns institutions.
They have nothing to lose.
That, of course, is unacceptable.
A new balance of power is emerging.
That on paper is the bubble economy.
The capital market inflated.
We have all had to pay out via the IMF.
It appears to be a recurring problem.
We should not be so easily reassured.
There is indeed no turning back.
Our institutions were formed slowly.
The vanity of the West is evident.
Interest is the basic motivation.
This is the real situation.
We are firmly convinced of this.
The cause of our concern is clear.
Not even that danger can be ruled out.
Mr President, Mr Santer is right.
What, then, should they do now?
Grave dangers threaten us.
What?
That is the last straw.
Perhaps it is masochism.
You must be joking!
Secondly, we must also act jointly.
Are we in favour of urgent action?
Should the Fund be reformed?
Should we contribute more funds?
We can only help.
So we must not abdicate responsibility.
What is the issue?
Confidence is imperative.
That is all.
We need this.
This could be done in one of two ways.
It has got into the wrong hands.
The real economy cannot cope with that.
Harmonisation is essential!
It cannot be imposed from outside.
This remark needs some qualification.
Too little has been done.
I say that not as an excuse.
Welcome
Welcome to the House.
What will these effects be?
Why?
Because the foundations are firm.
This is essential.
I believe that we must reflect on this.
So what is the solution?
Transparency should be extended.
We must maintain confidence.
They have a government.
We must therefore keep calm.
What shape will this dialogue take?
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
VOTES
Let me be clear.
However, my concern is this...
(The President cut the speaker off)
The Rules are very clear.
It has to go back to committee.
Thank you, I am glad you said that.
I can confirm this.
Amendment No 8:
(Parliament rejected the resolution)
I will leave you to work it out.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I was given back my old card.
Thank you very much.
I move that the vote be taken now.
Amendments Nos 1 to 4:
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
It was an administrative problem.
We apologise for that.
That is what I am now asking you to do.
Then we can vote by roll call.
That is the end of the matter.
COM in rice (C4-0276/98)
Nothing.
Schaffner report (A4-0108/98)
(Heckling from Mr Schulz)
Lannoye recommendation (A4-0278/98)
Valverde L√≥pez report (A4-0279/98)
Christodoulou report (A4-0396/98)
We refuse to take part in this game.
- Echelon system
Transparency first and last.
Campoy Zueco report (A4-0235/98)
It makes you stop and wonder.
Ireland has not been measuring up.
Our green image is being undermined.
Mohamed Al√≠ report (A4-0167/98)
It is the wrong approach.
We should therefore heed this example.
Customs Union with Turkey
How do things look in practice?
I expected nothing less from him.
The Union's position is plain.
Europe is willing to help.
Only then can we survive together.
Anything else would be a mistake.
Anyway, now to the matter in hand.
Is this the proper way to proceed?

The answer is ready to hand.
Very little.
I can fully endorse its contents.
The debate is closed.
Situation in Kosovo

Indeed so, Mr Alavanos.
I shall give her the floor in a moment.
New refugees join them almost daily.
But we must keep a sense of proportion.
My third point is this.
I am in favour of stronger measures.
What are we Europeans actually doing?
It is now September!
It has not been implemented yet.
That is ridiculous!
It is quite inexplicable to anyone.
This cannot be true!
But what does that mean?
Who is to keep them safe?
The situation has to improve!
You too have made many appeals today.
For ten years Kosovo has beckoned us.
That is not the case.
So much for the true facts.
The tragedy is worsening.
What must be done?
There is no time to lose.
On the third attempt he was murdered.
Yet nothing was done for years.
That is quite clearly a war crime.
And it needs to be said.
Next: who is responsible?
Milosevic of course!
That too has been said often enough.
That needs to be said quite clearly!
I refer to Kosovo.
The Kosovo problem is centuries old.
But dialogue is not enough.
There is a precedent.
What can be done?
And we duly went on our holidays!
Which line is Europe following?
The question of safe havens was raised.
That is not entirely true.
That misery will continue.
They are Albanians in Kosovo.
That is a legitimate point of view.
The debate is closed.
Associated companies
Thank you, Mr Secchi.
Question Time (Council)
Subject: Schengen Agreement
Subject: Algeria
Subject: Road-use charges
That too was part of the settlement.
Subject: Leaving the EU
What is the Council's view?
That was one point.
If you like I will repeat it again.
You have the floor for one minute.
Subject: The white-slave trade
That has now been done.
That is what I wished to add.
Thank you, Mr Smith.
It is up to you.
We are glad of that.
Subject: Georgia
Subject: Radioactive and toxic waste
I am quite happy to do so.
We find this unacceptable and unsafe.
Subject: Human rights in Iraq
This is completely intolerable.
Let me add a few comments.
Thank you, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner.
That concludes Question Time.
Associated companies (continuation)
The debate is closed.
Welcome
The single currency is a fact.
To me, that is 43 too many.
Obviously we have to correct that.
It has never been implemented fully.
We shall certainly be voting for it.
That, however, is another matter.
We will all support it, Commissioner.
Such barriers can and must be removed.
The joint debate is closed.
Tax harmonisation
Finally, a completely different point.
Therefore, we will support them.
Forza , Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The total could be 20 %.
Why?
Will it work?
We need to license these companies.
Some of them are cowboys.
Do you feel robbed?
We operate world-wide.'
I can only agree with him on that.
But the EU is fighting back!
The statistics beggar belief.
This is all I wanted to say.
So we are on the right path.
But that is not the end of the matter.
They must be prepared for the euro.
Small is beautiful.
When will the report on 1998 be ready?
The quality is bound to suffer.
And what does this amount to?
The same goes for the issue of lawyers.
We need to change our mentality too.
Mr President, on a point of order.
You are the President.
I hope that this will change in future.
The joint debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 0.10 a.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
We shall proceed accordingly.
(The Minutes were approved)
Thank you, Mr Bertens.
The problems are well-known.
Now the low point has been reached.
We cannot stop now, we must keep going.
My thanks to the rapporteur.
I think it is a very important area.
We think that is the right approach.
That is agreed.
Thank you, Commissioner Flynn.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Women: impact of unemployment
But it goes further than that!
These concern women especially.
Why?
Take flexibility.
The same goes for childcare.
But how can childcare be free?
Someone has to pay for it.
Here is another great idea.
Firstly, women's unemployment.
Unequal pay must also be highlighted.
I support that idea strongly.
I imagine you have been quoted wrongly.
I think we have to go further.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is an extraordinary figure.
I will concentrate on two.
That is the central point.
So what needs to happen?

There are three steps we need to take.
We must put a stop to this.
What is the reason for this?
We are still terribly wary.
We need other kinds of measures.
There is no equivalent for women.
I fully support what happened there.
I accept that fully.
That is an important step forward.
That is going to be highlighted.
Mrs Seillier makes that point.
That has been achieved.
These have to be dismantled.
The debate is closed.
In any case it gives us hope.
VOTES
Amendment No 33
I also agree with you.
Amendment No 18
You are right, Mr Sainjon.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I am assured that report is wrong.
The cease-fire is still in effect.
We would then have to vote on this.
We still need to vote on paragraph 17.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Harrison report (A4-0303/98)
Secchi report (A4-0299/98)
Langen report (A4-0084/98)
Miller report (A4-0064/98)
It is even stronger than Viagra.
Far from it.
Energy prices continue to be too low.
It is pathetic.
The rest is nothing but propaganda.
The IMF hands out credit.
So what can be done?
McMillan-Scott report (A4-0251/98)
This is not the answer.
Our relations must become deeper.
Now it is Turkey's turn.

I simply cannot go along with this.
That concludes voting time.
Situation in the Great Lakes region
One thing is certain.
That is all for now, Mr President.
It is a vicious circle.
I can summarise it in a few sentences.
The genocide which ensued was horrific.
In Burundi too a colonel seized power.
They have all now disappeared.
The dead cannot talk.
How many more will there be?
This is what almost all Angolans want.
Has Mr Kabila become a democrat?
Not at all.
Quite the contrary.
This is what we must try to achieve.
Are these borders really inviolable?
They were not banana republics.
We cannot do anything more for them.
My second point is this, Mr President.
We must show humility, as I said.
At no time did I feel threatened.
That concludes the debate.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
This is one of the main causes.
I reject this accusation.
It is not the only opposition party.

The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 5.30 p.m.
We have become used to it.
It is quite simple.
The same is true of Afghanistan.
That is what this resolution is for.
But what does this mean?
I look forward to his support.
Thank you for warning me.
It is the focal point of the motion.
That is one example.
Have you followed me now?
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 5.30 p.m.
The situation is almost unprecedented.
Certainly not!
And, sometimes, of institutions.
Would Members please take their seats.
Why?
Otherwise it is not possible.
Colleague, let me interrupt you.
It is not acting as it should.
He did not do so.
Thank you, Commissioner Pinheiro.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has a point of order.
Thank you, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
VOTES (continuation)
I wonder what they are for?
I would ask you to stop doing so.
We are so upset we were not included.
(Laughter and applause)
We can now continue with our work.
That concludes the votes for today.
Your wish is my command!
(Parliament decided to continue voting)
Companies would no longer function.
It is unrealistic.
I do not believe that is the same.
That is something different.
We really must not confuse the two.
Castagn√®de report (A4-0252/98)
So what should we do?
This is an important point.
Thank you, Madam President.
But we want companies to function.
This is completely absurd!
This was rejected.






Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has a point of order.
We voted first on the amendment.
We hope that you will too.
The debate is closed.
Single mothers and one-parent families
I would like to make a further comment.
We too reject the United States model.
I have seen workfare at first hand.
They are both very relevant.
How misguided we are!
New models are developing.
Poverty is the real threat here.
They are all committed to it.
Let us put them to the test now.
The debate is closed.
Fisheries monitoring
This must be put right.
That cannot be a good thing.
This is not a good basis.
Monitoring alone will not suffice.
We will support the Provan report.
Often that is not made very clear.
She would like to have been here.
I am pleased to take the report.
That is where the problem arises.
That is not done well.
Mr McCartin also mentioned that point.
Something could be done there.
I would like to see that happen.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.45 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
You did indeed chair the sitting.
I think we can all testify to that.
Are there any other comments?
I have taken note of your suggestions.
Mr Kerr wishes to speak on the Minutes.
I asked whether this was a record.
(The Minutes were approved)
VOTES
What is the rapporteur's opinion?
Thank you, Mrs Garc√≠a Arias.
No, that suggestion is not appropriate.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Provan report (A4-0277/98)
EC-Madagascar fishing agreement
One further point.
I just wanted to make this clear.
What is actually happening in practice?
Thank you, Commissioner Flynn.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
I cannot vote in favour of this report.
EC-Gabon fishing agreement
Thank you very much Mr Olsson.
Thank you, Mr Flynn.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
I cannot vote in favour of this report.
EC-Azerbaijan trade agreement
Thank you, Mr President.
I thank the House for its indulgence.
Thank you, Mr Flynn.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Thank you, Mr Ford.
I will pass that comment on.
Thank you Mr R√ºbig.
Thank you, Mr Van Dam.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 10.44 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Order of business
The next item is the order of business.
Thank you for giving me the floor.
Waiver of Mr Le Pen's immunity
Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has the floor.
Mr Fayot has the floor.
Yes indeed.
That is a crime under German law.
We must look this horror in the eye.
(Applause)
There are two questions.
This, however, is dangerous ground.
So all eyes will be on tomorrow's vote.
Five minutes, Mr President!
No, Mr Le Pen, you have three minutes.
You have the floor, Mr Le Pen.
That prosecutor lied!
That is a detail.
This mendacious procedure is a scandal.
I would add...
Mr Le Pen, I gave you three minutes.
That was their decision.
Mr Gollnisch will have...
That is their decision.
I gave you three minutes.
But friend Le Pen cannot help himself.
(The President cut the speaker off.)
He has on at least one occasion ...
I look forward to the case being held.
The debate is closed.
Drugs
Let me cite two of these improvements.
That must never be allowed to happen.
How best do we get to them?
These questions must be answered.
There is less to object to in it.
What form should it take?
Action in three areas.
That is for the long term.
You don't say!
Brilliant!
We are hiding behind an absurdity.
No new views are put forward.
So what exactly is the position?
No one wants to stop them.
Surely that is not too much to ask?
What does this endless debate teach us?
I do not know anybody who can do that.
Both have the same problems.
It tries to establish this balance.
This report can therefore be supported.
That is quite unacceptable!
This debate is highly polarised.
That is a rather different matter.
That is a considerable difference!
Let us not split hairs, Mr President.
You should not argue in this way.
The debate is closed.
Combating corruption
On that I fully agree with Mr Schulz.
This phenomenon deserves our attention.
It is as simple as that.
This sends a conflicting message.
Thank you, Mrs Gradin.
The debate is closed.
Common fisheries policy: control system
What are these?
Clearly that is not happening.
What else do we need?
We need better information.
It is a matter of justice and equity.
We have a great opportunity here.
Demand for fish is high.
That was a very important issue too.
We do not want too much bureaucracy.
There are too many grey areas.
It is quite simply impossible.
Now they are to be implemented.
Yet we have made quite good headway.
These things are hard to check.
It is far from possible at present.
That is an important point.
On a point of order, Mr President.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
It is pure politics on Mr Coates' part.
(The Minutes were approved)
The Italian authorities?
The European System of Central Banks?
A number of issues were raised.
That appears to be a good idea.
This does not allow it.
More supervisory control is essential.
Confidence in the market is not enough.
Changes have to be made.
Is the message not clear enough?
This is the wrong sort of ratio.
This is hardly true of the SME sector.
It has already happened in Finland.
Everyone is agreed on this.
We have no control over that.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Telecommunications equipment
It is right to say it openly.
This is Amendment No 18.
This is the best option.
I commend the text to you.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Changeover to euro
We shall certainly be voting in favour.
Similar things may happen here.
I have little time for either view.
There is a lack of know-how.


That must not happen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
VOTES
I commend this proposal to Parliament.
Leperre-Verrier report (A4-0342/98)
Wibe report (A4-0317/98)
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is no cause for celebration.
These camps were yours, not ours.
This is an example of witch hunting.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
That says it all.

That is precisely what I wish to see.
Why this fear?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Immorality rules in this Parliament.
But he has not moved me.
Might these be political?
Is this a case of political morals?
Morals do not come into these choices.
Read recommendation (A4-0337/98)
Hoppenstedt report (A4-0332/98)
Katiforis report (A4-0329/98)
That is not our opinion.
Hendrick report (A4-0327/98)
d'Ancona report (A4-0211/98)
This is not true.
Nor do we consider it desirable.
There is a drugs problem in Ireland.
This is a unequal struggle.
The danger is upon us.
What will it take to wake Europe up?
Bontempi report (A4-0285/98)
The EU is just such a system.
This is of prime importance.
The challenge is a fundamental one.
Langen report (A4-0304/98)
The rest of the expenditure is in ECU.
But there is even worse to come.
That concludes the votes.
UCLAF
We must keep it under control.
And so to UCLAF itself.

I have always made this a priority.
This applies to about 20 cases.
What are the facts?
This brings me to my third comment.
I now come to my fourth comment.
But I will go further.
Why?
It is too complex and cumbersome.
Or who should be?
So it is not possible, Mr President.
Do you not agree, Mr Santer?
The Commission lives in an ivory tower.
My speaking time is up.
Then we had just 434 members.
I hope we shall meet again.
But we must make swift decisions.
That point must be addressed.
That is a very important point.
Are we then not in a worse situation?
I hope we can come to a positive reply.
We demand to know what is happening.
Thank you, Mrs Gradin.
The debate is closed.
1996 discharge
Indeed, the errors were legion.
Another item was the inventories.
It asked me to fill in what I had.
One would hope it can be rectified.
That is paragraph 15 in its entirety.
The word 'deplores' is strong.
There was not time enough.
What happened?
In paragraph 13 we mention consultants.
This is disgraceful.
But the previous one was a farce.
We did not get to the bottom of it.
It has not yet been dealt with.
Both needed his close attention.
The debate is closed.
This is not to be used as a slush fund.
What conclusions can we draw?
We wanted to strike a balance.
I wish to make four points.
This is highly creditable.
Mr Tappin has produced a good report.
This is for several reasons.
I hope that clarifies the position.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
You have the floor, Mr R√ºbig.
Mr President, I agree completely.
Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen.
I cannot yet reply in any more detail.
The EU has a responsibility.
It is not just Belgium.
This has not been successful.
That could be a humanitarian angle.
Thank you Commissioner for your answer.
It is clearly not.
Thank you, Mr Oreja.
It is not acceptable.
The EU has to look at this.
Have they no rights under EU law?
It does not make any sense.
That is not acceptable.
That is quite clear.
This is truly essential.
The Commission is financing this.
There is, for example, NGO cofinancing.
The first is WTO as a whole.
What can we do as a matter of urgency?
Thank you, Commissioner.
Subject: Rational Planning Directive
That is all.
The Commission awaits your decisions.
Subject: Sex tourism involving children
Thank you very much, Mr Papoutsis.
What do you think?
Can we answer Mr Titley's question?
Thank you, Mr Papoutsis.
Why was next to nothing then done?
Never again is this Parliament's aim.
Never again!
But that is the way it is.
Citizens regularly travel on ferries.
We need to ensure their safety.
Enforcement is an absolutely key area.
The Union had to act.
The debate is closed.
Pan-European transport network
It is unacceptable!
This cannot be true!
That is pointless!
We are in favour of rail.
Let us be very clear.
What do I mean by that?
My group sees two priorities here.
That has also been mentioned.
We talked earlier about black boxes.
That is a good thing.
The rapporteur himself deplores this.
The debate is closed.
Transport telematics
The debate is closed.
Tourism
It is also important to job creation.
There is no uniform concept of tourism.
The good news first.
Now the bad news.
Competition is worldwide.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
(Applause)
(The Minutes were approved)
European Conference/Malta
That is a step in the right direction.
No such possibility is open to Malta.
That is of vital importance.
This is what we want to see.
I would add to that list Ukraine.
But we must not get carried away.
So Malta has all its papers in order.
I should like to make that quite clear.
The debate is closed.
Situation in Kosovo
That is unacceptable!
Let us have action!
Enough is enough!
Do something!
And now the countdown has started.
How will it negotiate?
There are 50 000 soldiers there.
Mrs van Bladel is right there.
You are right there, Mrs Pack.
We mentioned Karadzic.
This fact is unbearable for all of us.
Then there will be change in Kosovo.
We are flexing our muscles.
But what are we going to do?
That is the policy of Pontius Pilate.
Milosevic will not allow this.
That is Milosevic's policy.
It is perfectly clear.
We do not want military intervention.
That is hypocrisy in all its glory.
NATO is getting ready to bomb Serbia.
Nothing.
Nothing.
What did it do in 1968 in Prague?
Nothing.
We should be consistent here.
We all agree on that.
What has changed?
That is what I meant.
NATO is not naive.
VOTES
That is the decision of the Chair.
We feel this is quite unnecessary.
Linkohr report (A4-0350/98)
Le Rachinel recommendation (A4-0349/98)
Watts report (A4-0310/98)
They were mistaken!
Teverson report (A4-0331/98)
We will therefore abstain in the vote.
That is both logical and correct.
B√∂sch report (A4-0297/98)
Why not?
My group is well placed to know that.
I congratulate Mr B√∂sch.
Who has anything to hide from us here?
Sis√≥ Cruellas report (A4-0241/98)
These were a great success.
Baldarelli report (A4-0246/98)
Novo Belenguer report (A4-0247/98)
There is an even more astonishing fact.
That concludes voting time.
Own resources (budget procedure)
It is presented in two parts.
But this proposal raises problems.
Long awaited, much longed-for!
That is the first point.
Where does the fault lie?
It lies with the repayments.
They will find it hard.
(Applause)
This is the basis for a larger Union.
Mr President, I am deeply disappointed.
Europe or the Member States?
Europe is at a critical stage just now.
We have gone beyond Amsterdam.
Why not talk about trade?
Why not talk about finance?
I am not talking of a heavy tax.
A very simple tax would suffice.
What message are they broadcasting?
That is what we should be discussing.
That is the approach we will take.
That is one part of this whole report.
You received the papers very late.
So take your time, study it all.
Of course we are against it.
That is one side, and that is clear.
The debate is closed.
Migrants
This cannot go on.
The second point concerns Europol.
For them it is a matter of survival.
No-one would gain from that.
Most come by sea but some come by land.
These are difficult issues.
We have to be seen to act.
However, resources are needed.
Thank you, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner.
The debate is closed.
EU/Hong Kong
I hope we have advanced the debate.
I think that is important.
I should like to thank him for that.
Our watchword must be vigilance.
In my own?
In all the European countries?
Are we happy with those systems?
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is quite true.
And so we shall be.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
This is an abuse of that Convention.
Subject: Petitions
That is very kind of you.
That is true.
Subject: US-Cuba relations
We are currently considering this.
If so, from what areas, and why?
That led to certain misunderstandings.
Secondly, this is not a new subject.
That is precisely our procedure here.
I agree with Mr McCartin.
Mr Posselt has a point of order.
Mr President, I only have one question.
There are also strong supporters of it!
But that was not reflected here at all.
Why the delay?
That is not in question.
Thank you, Madam President-in-Office.
Thanks to her once again.
That concludes Question Time.
Pollution-related diseases
This is the basis of Amendment No 7.
That is the aim of Amendment No 11.
That is the aim of Amendment No 6.
However, we are still concerned.
Three years is not enough.
We need at least five years.
We need a more ambitious programme.
Mistakes have been made in the past.
I agree with Mrs Ojala there.
I address that to Mrs McKenna.
That is being taken on board.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Rare diseases
We say that from a legal point of view.
The debate is closed.
Activities in favour of consumers
Maybe.
They deserve our salutations for that.
This report was urgently needed.
Amendments Nos 16 and 33 are essential.
I support Amendments Nos 24 and 26.
For us that is the crucial point.
We support the Commission proposal.

This brings me to my final point.
I wholeheartedly support the report.
Consumers first!
The debate is closed.
Conditional access services
Let us hope it acts soon.
Thank you, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
Recognition of qualifications
There are sound reasons for this.
I think that is most important.
But it is more than that.
Why?
But it must not remain an isolated one.
Let us implement them!
Here we have one!
Thank you, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
Court of First Instance
So we have a crisis.
This is certainly true.
The rapporteur spoke of pluralism.
And this is precisely the point here.
Thank you, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mr Stockmann.
We will look into that for you.
I tabled this question on 7 April.
Thank you, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel.
(The Minutes were approved)
5th framework programme
The second point is the following.
We owe this to European taxpayers.
That really must be avoided.
It is the war of the SMEs.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Enlargement is on the way.
I believe this is the right approach.
The programme is already under way.
Is this our aim?
That is just how things are.
I have calculated it roughly.
Europe is lacking resources.
What are the priorities?
I regret this very much.
The nuclear lobby was too strong.
This secrecy must stop.
We are not allowed to reprocess it.
The Danish experience is unequivocal.
It has our support.
There are many types of risk.
We welcome the framework.
It provides a sort of legal base.
The budget is inadequate.
I like his phrase 'lean and clean'.
I have put my suggestions before you.
The environmental reasons are clear.
The first concerns the legal basis.
Thirdly, regarding the SURE programme.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.

Joint motion for a resolution on Kosovo
We are very far away from this!
This is both tragic and ridiculous.
The West must now react.
It is human lives.
But this is not enough.
On this level, Europe can be useful.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Madam President, she was 20 years old.
She refused to be expelled.
It is as simple as that.
Oh no!
That is how it happens in Europe.
There is no way round that.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Poor Semira!
The figures prove this.
I would never dare to say this.
They are Mr Tobback's words.
What have we done over recent years?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
We note this with satisfaction.
A difficult task awaits the opposition.
Thank you, Commissioner Pinheiro.

Why is she being persecuted?
The book was banned in her own country.
Malaysia
Why?
Women will be in one, men in another.
This situation has to be addressed.
You cannot have single-sex hospitals.
We have to be vigilant.
Asia also rejects such practices.
What is happening in Iran is terrible.

We now come to the vote.
After the vote on Slovakia
I walk into the Chamber and here he is!
JET
This really will not do.
There is another problem.
Conditions change.
At least we have got somewhere.
I hope that it would not take so long.
But it has made considerable progress.
It is very easily done.
We welcome the Commission proposal.
This will not really do.
It is technically very complicated.
It is hard to say.
The debate is closed.
That was in 1991.
They also speak Italian there.
There is still a great deal to be done.
The debate is closed.
This may be appealing.
I do not like it.
This applies to both old and new areas.
Those were some of our priorities.
I am curious to know his reaction.
There are limited financial resources.
I am sure Eurostat shares this view.
That is the purpose of Amendment No 13.
Then they could become more comparable.
I wonder what needs to be improved.
It must not be like that in the future!
These are two different things.
Mr President, I have a point of order.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.05 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Could we have a full record?
We are only approving the Minutes here.
Some of us have other work to do.
(Mixed reactions)
(The Minutes were approved)
We shall look into that.
VOTES
Pigmeat
So intervention buying can take place.
There are solutions, Commissioner.
A pig cycle is nothing new.
Is it going to react?
What has happened?
Emergency measures are necessary.
Nor have I expanded my production.
So I think this is a homemade crisis.
The pigs did not go on holiday.
I know there are no easy solutions.
The pig industry is important.
The whole industry is in crisis.
Farm incomes have been slashed.
That is the gravity of the situation.
We spend 5 billion annually on beef.
In the dairy sector we spent 3 billion.
We have to find funding for that.
We are not starting with nothing.
But they are asking for help.
There are other issues.
What other measures could be taken?
Europe's farmers need help now.
So I shall be very brief.
I want to address four points.
That too needs pointing out.
This is the best opportunity to do so.
I am doing so, obviously.
We have all been doing so for ages.
(Applause)
In Germany it rose by 4 %.
Thank you, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)

That is just counterproductive.
But the Commission was on holiday.
There was no-one in charge in Brussels.
No-one was able to take a decision.
Everything was blocked.
The euro and the CAP
I think we will agree.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
Thank you very much, Mrs Anttila.
I still have my reservations.
I think that is crux of the matter.
That is our only intention here.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Thank you, Mrs Schierhuber.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Yet what are we seeing at present?
But that is another story!
Why is this quality policy important?
We do not have any surpluses.
One last thought.
It could certainly have been predicted.
It is cyclical.
What is the alternative?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
All my constituents are food consumers.
There are two important points here.
Objective 2: job-creation
I am not going to do that.
Let me explain where we must disagree.
There is a downside, however.
Thank you, Mr Donnay.
Thank you, Mrs Wulf-Mathies.
The debate is closed.
The Chair can only apply the Rules.
Thank you very much, Mr Berthu.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
ARIANE - KALEIDOSCOPE
The decisions were adopted unanimously.
It is now up to the Council.
Thank you very much, Mr Medina.
The joint debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
That concludes Parliament's agenda.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 12.45 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
The road to peace is not assured.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
We congratulate them.
I bitterly regret that.
We are very pleased for him.
(Applause)
Approval of the Minutes
I would ask that this be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
Welcome
Membership of Political Groups
We shall welcome him here tomorrow.
Agenda
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has the floor.
Therefore, Mrs Lulling has the floor.
I ask you to rectify this immediately.
I do not consider this to be correct.
I wonder!
We must do that another time.
The debate is closed.
Inland waterway vessels
This cannot and should not be allowed.
The Rhine rules are very efficient.
This is of crucial importance.
Anyway, I agree with the rapporteur.
Mr McMahon said as much already.
That needs to change, and fast.
The debate is closed.
Protection of water against pollution
This is way above EU limits.
It is seeking a 25 % Community subsidy.
We should not be intimidated by this.
We all agree in principle.
We do not need to change it.
How should we address the problem?
But let us try other ways first.
I am most grateful to you for that.
I heartily agree with what she says.
This is no longer the case today.
There is no more time to lose.
How can the two be made compatible?
That is an issue waiting to be tackled.
However, that is not enough.
The debate is closed.
Endocrine-disrupting chemicals
Why?
We call upon the Commission to act.
Why are they a cause for concern?
They impair reproductive functions.
We know of their effects on animals.
I would question that.
The debate is closed.
Biodiversity
We need to take action.
Perhaps you can do something about it?
Transport and energy are missing.
That is indeed embarrassing.
Let us change that.
I am sure that will be understood.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.30 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
That will be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
Statement by the President
My group is in favour.
(Parliament approved the request)
Decision on urgent procedure
Thank you, Mr Viola.
Is this right?
We must not be taken in by this.
The choice is clear and we approve it.
Are we mad?
Discussions continue on some aspects.
We wish to support it.
There are two reasons for this.
The second point is research policy.
We know how important they are.
We know how important gender is.
We have taken account of this.
But it is not ambitious enough.
(Applause)
It was appreciated.
We are going to leave no margin.
I turn now to the different areas.
I move to the Commission budget.
That is the purpose of that amendment.
Lastly, I come to ECHO.
It was a tactical reserve.
Now for some more specific issues.
Many thanks to her.
Social policy was the most affected.
These have now been eliminated.
That was a good starting-point.
This is what happened.
This is not justified.
This is also open to question.
Nobel Peace Prize
Afterwards I will give him the floor.
All of us are with you in that.
Our warmest congratulations to you.
The country is proud of you.
Well done, John.
(Applause)
And he has set an example for us all.
Thank you, John Hume.
It has moved peace along.
It is the only way forward.
His courage should not go unnoticed.
We have a challenge before us.
I think we will face that challenge.
(Applause)
But it happened.
VOTES
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Gahrton report (A-0245/98)
Koch report (A4-0351/98)
McKenna report (A-0284/98)
Jensen report (A-0281/98)
Human life deserves protection.
We need to be abreast of this.
The public is worried.
Sj√∂stedt report (A-0347/98)
I believe this is an impossible demand.
This is the way it should remain.
I will not labour the point.
The same thing happened last time.
Do not accuse us of squandering now.
Take that on board.
Obviously I do not share that view.
That is indeed pure demagogy.
That is why the reserve was created.
The Commission has reacted.
I would sincerely invite you to do so.
I believe this is important.
This is a real record.
The situation is impossible.
Farmers cannot continue as at present.
Although it was not, we were.
Firstly, B1-3800.
Has that already happened?
Is it going to happen?
So austerity is not an end in itself.
That defies belief, of course.
It cannot be and it must not be.
We are in favour of enlargement.
I think it is a bad one.
That is not the intention.
We should draw attention to that.
Thank you, Mr McCartin.
I must admire your commitment.
They have to be updated.
We are seen to be responsible.
That is not what Parliament intends.
One last thing, Mr President.
Thank you, Mr President.
But that is not my intention now.
There it has succeeded.
It was unfortunate.
He referred to misunderstandings.
I feel sorry for President Santer.
This has never happened.
We are still waiting for this statute.
I am talking about bananas.
This was rejected by the Commission.
This has also been rejected.
And tourism is one such sector.
The weaker dollar does not help either.
The joint debate is closed.
European Union progress in 1997
This has not been done for years.
The link with the past was broken.
Thank you, Mrs Spaak.
What is the Council doing here?
The paralysis is as great as ever.
Here too the Treaty must be improved.
The second is Agenda 2000.
Then I realised that it is nearly 1999.
Now for the content of the report.
We need a strong single currency.
Secondly, Schengen.
Self-evidently that is nonsensical.
Finally we come to paragraph 21.
There was balance with six.
There is balance with 15.
There must be balance with 25.
Now Schengen is included in the Treaty.

It is clear.
The instruments are there.
I am coming to an end, Mr President.
I protested against that, nothing else.
The debate is closed.
Commission statement on MAI
There are already some WTO rules.
Cui bono? Who benefits?
And why not?
The facts bear this out.
This is really crucial.
Please read the texts first!
I know I am right.
Irreversible!
No, it does not.
Of course not.
This secures many jobs.
What lessons have been learnt?
Not at all.
That is the reality of the situation.
You can do what you like.
It is nonsense.
All of that is clear.
What does that mean?
I said:
That is what I said.
The debate is closed.
Emissions from diesel engines
No, we have to be ambitious.
We know all about those problems.
It is of interest to us too.
But that does not excuse us.
I do think that we can try.
The debate is closed.
Volatile organic compounds
But we do not think it is perfect.
We hope the Commission will do so also.
It can harm both people and animals.
There is no use trying to do that.
We must quite simply be rid of them.
They belong to a bygone age.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Mr Schierhuber has the floor.
Mr President, my name is Schiedermeier!
Could I ask you to correct that?
Thank you.
I would like this to be corrected.
Thank you.
You will be included in the list.
Thank you for your attention.
There is still much work to be done!
(Applause)
And of course it is.
Fine words, but just what do they mean?
Europe is not an end in itself.
I believe in a strong European Union.
We operate within the institutions.
They knew what it would not be about.
At least that is what I hope.
The people need to feel secure.
But more needs to be done.
Let us learn and apply that lesson.
That is all very well.
And what about Europe?
And our foreign and security policy?
That is the point.
We need to know who does what.
The House has failed in this task.
We do not want any grand declarations.
It is an informal European Council.
Bravo!
The agenda is already very crowded.
Do not overload the timetable.
You must remember that.
Well done!
How can this be achieved?
It is a very federalist resolution.
What is the problem, you might ask.
Mr or Mrs CFSP must realise that too.
Thank you for this debate.
We have many common tasks.
Many thanks!
(Applause)
I shall gladly give him the floor.
Thank you, Mr Santer.
Who is to blame for this?
This is absurd.
Europe must assert itself!
The debate is closed.
VOTES
It is on communications.
I support the thrust of this report.
Lange report (A4-0364/98)
Spaak report (A4-0357/98)
That is the quota fixed by Mrs Spaak.
We must not overestimate its potential.
What do recent crises show us?
One causes the other.
It is not.
I have had the same experience.
We will not tolerate this!
Thank you very much!
Situation in Kosovo
We will do all we can to achieve that.
What has been achieved in recent weeks?
That is a cause for concern.
We have made that quite plain to him.
We will continue our work on that.
That remains to be seen.
Who could make us believe that?
How can they prove it?
The OSCE observers are unarmed.
Who are they?
What are their qualifications?
I checked it up in Germany.
He treads them all underfoot.
Kosovo is now the most acute problem.
Is this our only concern?
Everything is left to the UN and NATO.
I reject this idea.
We reject provocation from either side.
In any event, it is a solution.
The answer is a resounding 'no'.
I am right, am I not, Madam?
That would be sheer madness.
And here we are making a mistake.
No!
That is certainly true.
So that assertion is not true either.
Why?
That too was raised during the debate.
That is at least a first step.
It may even be a mistake.
That is the Council's position.
They are simply hostages.
This is the situation we are facing.
In the past we sent blue helmets.
I simply cannot understand this.
This really is losing all credibility.
I find that too patronising.
This really cannot be ignored.
Thank you, Mr Cushnahan.
The debate is closed.
Economic crisis in Latin America
But that is not the real danger.
Let me explain what I mean by this.
That country is Chile.
In 1973, the situation was different.
That happens for psychological reasons.
What is Latin America doing?
Now we are asking them to do more.
This is what this pressure implies.
What can they do?
What can we do to save our own system?
We need to have a fund to rescue them.
What size should this fund be?
We have wasted them.
A market is not a jungle.
That is what a market is.
The example of Chile has shown this.
The debate is closed.
Bytes are not neutral.
We need to look at quality.
That is not the real world either.
I believe it is none of these.
How should we respond?
Thank you, Mrs Thors.
That will be looked into.
I commend him on it.
The second rule is competition.
We are faced with a global challenge.
In Europe we have 20 million computers.
I think not.
What is the role of politics?
That is a hindrance to discussion.
Why?
Never!
As we saw in Italy.
The competition rules remain in force.
We can telephone through the Internet.
But that is not the point.
Not in the least.
Then it will not happen here.
That is the real problem.
Mr Gallagher?
He is gone too.
So that no longer needs saying here.
That is not the problem.
True enough.
It is an important one.
That is what we need.
It is a regulatory system.
That is the problem.
Thank you, Mr Bangemann.
The debate is closed.
Third stage of EMU
I will conclude with two points.
That is a luxury.
One thing is clear, however.
Care is required.
Part of the problem will solve itself.
I agree.
But foreign reserves are necessary.
He is not yet able to use them.
They will become internal assets.
Thank you, Mr de Silguy.
The debate is closed.
Protection of workers
This is nevertheless a start.
That is quite unacceptable.
It can also make sense economically.
That would not make sense.
Why has this not been done?
I dispute that approach.
The debate is closed.
Insurance
However, it is having no real effect.
The debate is closed.
Preferential tariff arrangements
We hope that it can be implemented.
That is unfair.
We should take action accordingly.
It is a general political observation.
But let us not exaggerate.
But now we need action not words.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.25 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Madam President.
I took part in all the votes yesterday.
Thank you, Mr Falconer.
That twofold mistake will be corrected.
In any event, we shall look into it.
Yes indeed.
Thank you for those comments.
(The Minutes were approved)
VOTES
Thank you, Mrs D√ºhrkop.
Draft Amendment No 714
Draft Amendment No 844
Draft Amendment No 738
Draft Amendment No 741

We shall proceed to the vote.
Draft Amendment No 808
Draft Amendment No 810
Mr Martens has the floor.
(Applause)
My group is in favour.
My group is in favour of voting.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Yes, Mr Martens.
Exactly, Mr Pasty.
Draft Amendment No 899
Of course.
Parliament has stated its position.
The rapporteur has asked for the floor.
On paragraph 21
On paragraph 30
On Amendment No 4
On paragraph 39
I agree with Mr Viola.
On Amendment No 6
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
On paragraph 31
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
You are quite right, Mrs Ojala.
D√ºhrkop D√ºhrkop report (A4-0360/98)
We are firmly opposed to such items.
Viola report (A4-0361/98)
It received only 224 votes.
Anything else is quite unethical.
But what can the European Council do?
Correia report (A4-0353/98)
Paasilinna report (A4-0328/98)
These amendments will have our support.
Giansily report (A4-0341/98)
There is still much to be done here.
I am conscious of their views.
So I understand them.
I am sure they will do that thoroughly.
This is due legal process.
Justice in this case has been slow.
This cannot be allowed to happen.
Were there crimes?
He deserves to be prosecuted.
Almost.
Probably not.
Some even have a diplomatic passport.
Thank you, Commissioner.
So what should be done?
That should not be in his report.
That is deplorable.
Europe will also do so, as will Japan.
Why?
And how do I know that they are low?
What are we demanding of workers?
That is another constraint.
So there are possibilities.
No, I say, that is not an option!
This question has not been resolved.
That is the crucial problem.
Thank you, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
What is it that we want?
How far do we want to go?
There may be many reasons for this.
I think that we are getting them.
So, what tangible measures do we mean?
I shall briefly mention a few of them.
Who has ever mentioned that?
How can all of that be assessed?
So who can decide?
That problem will not go away.
Who actually decides?
Alternative policies do exist.
Austria is a good example.
Here I agree with you.
So I am in agreement with you here.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is fine.
I do not have any problem with that.
Thank you.
VOTES
I am delighted by this.
(Applause)
Before the vote on Amendment No 8
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I find that unacceptable.
That concludes voting time.
This has disastrous effects.
I certainly wish to endorse that view.
That is why we should support it.
Let me mention four more points.
It also has an effect on farm income.
Of course they do.
Social criteria could also be added.
Imagine how much all this must cost.
That is how it is, Mr Funk!
Thank you, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
EAGGF: 26th financial report
This is an utterly untenable situation.
Thank you, Mr Mulder.
All well and good!
That is not good enough!
That cannot continue indefinitely.
And of course that puts us on the spot.
What is the reason for that?
What, in fact, is it all about?
But that is merely incidental.
I cannot agree with this approach.
This is excellent news.
It is as simple as that.
I am a little concerned about it.
What are we talking about this evening?
But now to the business in hand.
Thank you, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.45 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mr Eisma.
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr President, on a point of order.
VOTES
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr Wijsenbeek has a point of order.
Otila report (A4-0346/98)
I voted in favour of the report.
Santini report (A4-0368/98)
Rehder report (A4-0298/98)
Role of libraries
This is something we have got used to.
People need it and use it.
On the other hand, knowledge is power.
We fully support Mrs Ryyn√§nen's views.
Thank you, Mr Kerr.
On Fridays, we need him here.
We need to take care of them.
That was long ago.
Neo-liberalism is barbaric.
Now comes the 'but'.
I do not think that is wise.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I registered a symbolic abstention.
I lay your consciences at rest.
Sign language
Such things have to be sorted out.
Thank you, Mrs Maes.
The debate is closed.
Late payment by the Commission
Let me give you two examples.
Just imagine what happens.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
Welcome
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
I hope it will be dealt with very soon.
I give the floor to Mrs Pailler.
I do not understand what has happened.
It is simply a matter of lack of space.
Clearly it is not on today's agenda.
Can you explain?
We cannot require it to do so.
In fact, that is not the worst thing.
Mr President, on a point of order.
(Loud applause)
We must look forward and not back.
I have not received an answer.
That is what I regret so deeply.
Thank you, Mr Rosado.
We reached a national...
(The President cut the speaker off)
This really is a matter of principle.
(The Minutes were approved)
Enlargement
I give the floor to Mr van den Broek.
We know more and we understand better.
The goalposts have not been shifted.
Slovakia deserves a special mention.
Could you please finish immediately.
(Mixed reactions)
On Cyprus I can be very brief.
That was the main message here.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I am very sorry that we did not do so.
I have to try to make the best choice.
And answering questions is important.
You have to give us the texts.
I think that is a far better idea.
I have no programme.
It is not me who makes the agenda.
This will need to be verified.
Why do we say that?
Mr Bar√≥n Crespo will be aware of this.
It leaves a lot of hostages to fortune.
Turkey is considered as eligible.
That can clearly be seen.
I am talking about the Group of Six.
So it is very close.
But one thing is absolutely clear.
But I have not had a chance to speak.
What is going on?
I protest!
I do apologise.
These decisions are always difficult.
I give the floor to Mr Bonde.
What exactly will be the reply?
Obviously this is an ongoing process.
Thank you very much.
Partnership for Integration
That is our primary interest.
It is no longer simply a possibility.
We need to do them as well.
It needs to be a genuine partnership.
Welcome back, Commissioner!
We have made a number of demands.
It is a Community project.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Homeopathic medicinal products
Firstly, recognition.
My third point concerns labelling.
Fifthly, the names must be precise.
And it is easy to see why.
We have the instruments available.
I have tabled certain amendments.
We cannot ignore that.
It is a fact of life!
But that is a very narrow definition.
That covers many things.
We now await the Council's opinion.
Thank you, Mr Bangemann.
The debate is closed.
Liability for defective products
The Commission has not done this.
I have done it as rapporteur.
They are wrong on both counts!
Perhaps you could do so here tonight.
It cannot.
But we cannot in my view do any less.
The reason is quite simple.
It will avoid duplication.
Why do I disagree?
That is one point.
Naturally there are a few problems.
The first is a formal objection.
What we asked for, we have got.
You can become ill from eating game.
Who shot it?
Or maybe it flew across border areas?
In what field?
On which farmer's land?
That will be the right time to do so.
We can discuss that.
We will be having it.
We are still at first reading.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Culture 2000
What has the Commission proposed?
With an expanded budget we can do that.
We should have had a longer debate.
One conference was not really enough.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Removing obstacles to trade
It should not happen.
This is as it should be.
Is this an unimportant issue?
Of course not.
Is this a delicate issue?

But, Mr Kerr!
I am so sorry.
The debate is closed.
SMEs and craft sector
How are they used and by whom?
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.15 p.m.)
Education programmes
Innovation is a key element.
Ah, excellent, there she is now.
Let me run through them for you.
Commissioner, I do not like plans.
ECU 1.4 billion is too little.
Thank you, Mrs Pack.
We have one or two more points to make.
Thank you for your patience.
There is an imbalance here.

Education is a task for Europe.
It is money well spent!
We do not need to renationalise them.
I have every sympathy with it.
We can certainly wonder about this.
I want to make three clear points.
That is a detrimental step.
Oh, heckling!
So far she has not done so.
This deals with student exchanges.
This is a joke; nobody can live on it.
That is the important point.
We need to change the way we think.
I think he is spot-on.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Work-linked training
We emphasise the idea of pathways.
These are the amendments we can accept.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you also for your patience.
The debate is closed.
VOTES
I said most of them.
On the contrary, we agree completely.
We will be voting that position.
I tried to help that.
We are voting for his oral amendment.
I am very sorry.
I think we all agree on that.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
We must not let our guard down.
Castagnetti recommendation (A4-0374/98)
Roth-Behrendt report (A4-0326/98)
This is also totally inadmissible.
But with whom?
Mouskouri report (A4-0370/98)
The debate has been fascinating.
Waddington report (A4-0373/98)
Pack report (A4-0371/98)
De Coene report (A4-0389/98)
Skinner report (A4-0385/98)
We will stand by them.
Chanterie report (A4-0378/98)
Thyssen report (A4-0359/98)
That concludes voting time.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
I repeat: Dutch taxation reasons.
I should like this to be recorded.
We hear rumours here and we wait.
Why are there such delays?
However, I cannot give you a date.
That is outside our control.
Thank you, Mr Carnero.
I ask the Commission to act with haste.
This is not the right time to ask it.
And I still do not have my trunk!
(The President cut the speaker off)
You cannot have the floor.
Order of business
The next item is the order of business.

Tuesday:
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has the floor.
(Parliament approved the request)
Wednesday: no changes
Thursday:
Is there a speaker in favour?
Thank you, Mrs Aelvoet.
(Parliament approved the request)
Friday:
Thank you, Mr Rosado Fernandes.
Thank you, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
(Parliament approved the request)
MED Programmes
I believe that is unacceptable.
That was our priority.
We were well wide of the mark!
I will come back to this later.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I can illustrate this with an example.
Nobody would have said a word.
These credit cards have security marks.
No cashier can remember them all.
So we want to see them standardised.
We are less concerned with them.
Much of it we endorse.
But what is to be done?
In other words, we are looking into it.
But time is short.
It is a start, but it is not the end.
I have one final point.
Let us remember that.
There are three main points.
First things first.
The euro needs to generate confidence.
This should boost confidence.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Safer use of Internet
However, time is now of the essence.
They are redundant.
Thank you, Mr Schmid.
The debate is closed.
Clinical trials
Thank you, Mr Amadeo.
(The President cut the speaker off)
No!
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.30 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Please could my name be added.
That will be checked and corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
That is not the point, Mr President.
That is not the problem.
It is the diary which is wrong.
That needs to be corrected.
That is what Mr van Dam is asking.
Decision on urgent procedure
President.
Court of Auditors annual report
Mr Friedmann, you have the floor.
Why?
This information was not satisfactory.
What complaints do we have?
I think this is a very important point.
But that is your decision!
Mrs Wemheuer has the floor.
It is therefore a very broad area.
I therefore have two questions.
You also mentioned this in your report.
This is the central point.
That is an overall assessment.
Have you received these reports yet?
Why is there this delay?
Is it mismanagement by the Commission?
So that was the end of that.
However, I must make two points here.
That is obvious.
(Applause)
Thank you, Mr Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
Employment in the Union
That is an extremely good thing.
But things could be even better.
A laughable investment failure!
I find that incomprehensible.
This is affecting European jobs.
My second point relates to women.
We will stand by them in that.
What remedies have we come up with?
I think it is a great pity.
These are the main points.
I recognise and welcome this progress.
That is a big difference.
I think that is going to happen.
The momentum is there.
It will be a test for all of us.
The debate is closed.
Social action programme 1998-2000
VOTES
It is the same date in both cases.
This is only logical.
Thank you, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy.
Other groups ask for them as well.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr Evans, you are quite right.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Pirker report (A4-0390/98)
Schmid recommendation (A4-0377/98)
But in what way would it be safer?
Amadeo report (A4-0407/98)
The industry is familiar with them.
Schmid report (A4-0396/98)
As it has done already.
We are unable to support this report.
This is a good report overall.
I have no faith in such an approach.
That concludes Voting Time.
The second area is that of exclusion.
I think we have a new process here.
I think it has worked well.
So this is a missed opportunity.
There is, however, a problem.
And why was that?
That is not enough.
These gaps must be closed.
Let us be clear.
Our plan contains three elements.
We hope to do that on 25 November.
That will include enlargement.
I ask for your support for the plan.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Social dialogue
I would ask you to have this checked.
The second matter is sectoral dialogue.
We owe it to the small organisations.
I wish to concentrate on three points.
We could put it this way, Mr President.
Is this not what employers want?
It is also successful at company level.
Or so I am told, Commissioner.
This is a very good report.
There are real problems there.
I thank Mr Peter.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
New Transatlantic Marketplace
We must accept these realities.
Now we are merely informed.
We gave careful thought to this.
Let me quote a few of them.
Another issue is that of pension funds.
A balanced approach is needed here.
They were more ambitious.
I do not apologise for that.
The position is really quite simple.
Certainly not!
Mrs Peijs has talked about that.
These aspects must not be neglected.
That is absurd.
We must stop being naive!
We signed the GATT in 1994.
Has unemployment fallen?
Who suffered because of that?
No-one did.
Why will Europe not accept them?'
However, we obviously need to do more.
The one that is missing is GMOs.
My thanks to France.
They were created with good intentions.
This domination is not a fabrication.
But there is no question of that.
We must reject this.
It needs to be shown up for what it is.
I do not want to talk about bananas.
That is the first reason.
Thank you, Mr Salafranca.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
Subject: ECB
I thank the Commissioner for her reply.
I hope that is not the case here.
Educational input is very important.
Thank you, Mrs Wulf-Mathies.
Mr President, I understand the concern.
It is a scandal.
Do you know anything about that?
Subject: US-Cuba relations
What exactly do you have in mind?

We have not set a deadline.
Subject: Negotiations on the MAI
Subject: Steel
Subject: China-Taiwan relations
Please allow me to declare an interest.
I led a similar group there in 1995.
Taiwan is a free and open democracy.
Our links with Taiwan are very strong.
You must do one or the other.
Subject: Parallel imports into the EEA
When will the study be ready?
What will happen in the meantime?
Thank you, Mr Monti.
Thank you, Mr Gallagher.
Budget lines for human rights
I give the floor to Mr van den Broek.
In itself that is hardly surprising.
So where do we go from here?
That would help us.
But the dialogue did not take place.

We both know exactly what the truth is.
Why could we not do this ourselves?
We were told it was now ended.
That is not correct either.
I think that is the main priority.
Thank you, Mr van den Broek.
The debate is closed.
Patents
The debate is closed.
Supplementary pensions
The debate is closed.
Vehicles with more than 8 seats
They have done an admirable job.
Thank you, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
Aerospace industry
I will confine myself to this subject.
The report speaks of efficiency.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Euro coins
But I shall save that until the end.
It is only a matter of time.
That is crucial.
Is this the new German foreign policy?
And what do we find now?
I believe there is every reason.
I wish you all good-night!
Lead weighs much the same as gold.
Why?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 0.10 a.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
So I have to raise this matter again.
I wish to make that point.
Thank you very much, Mr Imbeni.
Thank you, Mr De Clercq.
Agenda 2000
Why must we reach agreement by March?
Can agreement be reached by March?
What was the reason for this?
Yet we must not rest on our laurels.
What is the real issue?
This applies to reform of its policies.
I think that is only normal.
It will happen again today.
Let the Council do the same!
You may be sure we are aware of that!
I would like to address four tasks.
Let me address a fourth aspect.
Time will show this to be the case.
The debate is closed.
Welcome
Pre-accession strategy

We cannot afford any duplication.
We must not fritter away our money.
Here we need room for manoeuvre.
Its remit would be twofold.
The car is in danger of collapsing!
Is the political will really there?
This is hardly surprising.
However, money is not everything.
He was right.
This is an important element.
But this is not the case.
Structural Funds would then be needed.
That was the problem.
It is Amendment No 2.
Who is to manage the Fund?
But be that as it may.
I would like to address one detail.




Welcome
(Applause)
VOTES
Mr President, on a point of order.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Laughter)
Welcome
(Sustained applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Pompidou.
VOTES (continuation)
I wonder what the Liberals are up to?
You are quite right.
Amendment No 2
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Welcome
(Applause)
VOTES (continuation)
This would not be good for this House.
Just listen a moment!
That is all you can do.
This is our circumstantial reason.
No offence was meant to your group.
It was a joke.
(Mixed reactions)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I must say that this request is absurd.
We have voted against this SAP.
This report is proof of that.
Peter report (Doc. A4-0392/98)
Erika Mann report (Doc. A4-0387/98)
Let us ensure that we do preserve them!
Europe must retaliate.
It did not do so.
Pre-accession strategy (continuation)
Economics is what divides Europeans.
I do not share his view.
The debate is closed.
Structural Funds
Consequently, we oppose that proposal.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We shall be voting on that tomorrow.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I support this completely.
That is no mean feat.
Thirdly, on access.
The proposal is too general.
What is our decision?
(The President cut the speaker off)
It is a man-made wilderness.
It was created by genocide.
We have taken full advantage of it.
That is a contradiction in terms.
And that brings me to Interreg.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I shall have to stop there.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We have reached that point now.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Take Lombardy, for instance.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I would say yes to the safety net.
Will the regulations be improved?
We have our doubts.
I would ask that flexibility ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
The Commission has done its best.
We have a serious literacy problem.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The debate is therefore adjourned.
That is squaring the circle, I know.
It is time to act.
Their main concerns are the following.
France is setting a good example here.
I shall continue in German.
There must be no taboos here.
We cannot justify it at all.
That is part of it.
We must redouble our efforts to help.
Thank you, Mr van den Broek.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Parliament is also prepared to do so.
That is quite unacceptable!
That is a tragedy.
True, the airport is not quite ready.
We have to be careful here.
I wanted to make that clear.
That must certainly be taken on board.
We have a contribution to make.
There were a few mentioned.
The hospital is there; it is empty.
They have yet to be resolved.
So there are impediments there.
The debate is closed.
Structural Funds (continuation)
GNP would be a much fairer criterion.
We must act now.
That is what has been determined.
That is the only correct approach.
For this reason I beg your indulgence.
I think that is something we all want.
It does this.
Thank you for your patience.
Madam President, it is very simple.
I will explain why very quickly.
However, let me be clear.
Thank you, Mr Flynn.
The debate is closed.
CAP, EAGGF
Thank you for attending this evening.
There are many types of aid.
That puts our minds at rest.
The two pillars are not yet pillars.
That will be exceptionally hard work.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Molterer.
I think it will be best for everyone.
I am opposed to national cofinancing.
And what of the world market?
Why do we need this policy?
There has to be a realistic assessment.
Yet this was just another dream.
Thank you, Mrs Myller.
The debate is closed.
I wish you a safe journey home.
(The sitting was closed at 0.17 a.m.)
We have to respect other parliaments.
Italy is a state under the rule of law.
We support the Italian authorities.
Statement by the President
They have their established powers.
VOTES
The first phrase of this amendment ...
I would like the first vote to count.
I should like to make that clear here.
Before the final vote
I see that Mr van den Broek agrees.
It is ridiculous.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
It is a very complex report.
(Parliament agreed to the proposal)
This should be reduced gradually.
Mr President, on the McCarthy report.
This will have to be reduced gradually.
But mistakes have been made.
We must not repeat this error.
This is blatantly inconsistent.
Kellett-Bowman report (A4-0380/98)
J√∂ns report (A4-0398/98)
Resolution on the CAP
G√∂rlach report (A4-0405/98)
That is why we abstained in this vote.
Displaced persons
So much for the positive comments.
Now the day-to-day reality.
There is no common return policy.
I regret this.
This cannot and must not continue.
The problem is burden-sharing.
That is decidedly too weak.
It is obviously absurd.
I have two major objections to this.
He has good formal grounds for this.
However, this all goes without saying.
Thank you, Mr Pradier.
These are not my words.
It is not even my conviction.
None of us want that to happen.
We all know what that would mean.
It really is incredibly difficult.
The proposed plan is not yet adequate.
I am convinced of the need for this.
It has to be one thing or the other!
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
That is clear.
Time is short.
It is really an economic problem.
The banks are bankrupt.
That too we could not allow.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
When will START II be ratified?
I would like to reassure them.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
It is madness!
It is outrageous!
He is violating his own people!
The Serbs feel like pariahs.
That would be a clear sign.
International Criminal Court
(The President cut the speaker off)
We need their signatures.
Akin Birdal
It was a very moderate speech.
That effectively blocks the situation.
That is not enough.
More progress is needed.
Nothing else will take us any further.
The Ocalan problem is a similar one.
Chalki seminary
Turkey's motive in doing this is clear.
Our joint resolution does that.
Anti-Semitism in Russia
We cannot simply remain silent!
We know how complicated it is.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you, Mr van den Broek.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
VOTES
Hoppenstedt report (A4-0362/98)
This is an interesting approach.
Displaced persons (continuation)
It therefore cannot be ignored.
In this respect, Mr Nassauer is right.
That really is an extreme situation.
Thank you, Mrs Gradin.
The debate is closed.
Visas/Airport transit
That includes these transit visas.
Why am I referring to this?
Such a situation is absurd!
I think this is the wrong approach.
Thank you, Mrs Gradin.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 6.55 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
We take note of that, Mrs Maij-Weggen.
I note that too, Mrs Breyer.
We shall see what can be done.
Can that be put into the record.
That will be corrected, Mr Hallam.
I wanted to vote against it.
That too will be corrected.
(The Minutes were approved)
VOTES
We ask for this to be duly corrected.
We shall take it into account.
They cannot be like open doors.

Lehne report (A4-0408/98)
Illicit manufacture of drugs
What are the important points then?
Ecstasy has now existed for 10 years.
We shall be voting for the amendments.
I think that is too much to hope for.
Finland's neighbour is Russia.
Only an appropriate system is feasible.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
WTO: financial services
That is our task for the future.
Nevertheless, there are some problems.
The WTO must also be reformed.
That is a different story.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Mr Van Miert, you have the floor.
Book pricing in Germany and Austria
Books are part of a country's culture.
Not every book becomes a best-seller.
The debate on book pricing drags on.
Just look at the United Kingdom.
It is not the first time.
It is indeed a matter of culture.
Let us leave it at that.
So what do you want?
Well, I will not accept that.
Let us be quite clear about it.
(NL) That is what the Court says.
Let us just look at the facts.
Those are facts.
There is no obligation of any kind.
There is no obligation of any kind.
The reason is technology.
That too is a general trend.
Otherwise it cannot be done.
That is the trend.
Why not?
Why do they have to stockpile it?
Why not give them that freedom?
But it is not happening.
You spoke of company mergers.
True or not?
Pope or Vatican, that is the reality.
I have no objection to that.
I am keen to have that debate.
People have fixed ideas.
They defend sacred cows.
The Commission accepted that long ago.
That is not what it is about.
That is the reality.
I am sorry, but I will not accept that!
That is part of democracy.
But people are worried.
We already have a liberalised market.
I worry about this.
What is the position?
Just come and see what the results are.
It is my own affair.
What kind of misrepresentation is that?
Let us talk seriously now.
That was how it worked.
Why?
That is why, that is the reality.
That is a fact.
That is how the system was.
Can we bear that in mind?
That is my experience.
May I ask you to do that?
That threat is hanging over us.
Thank you, Mr Elchlepp.
The debate is already closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That is the case!
Bertelsmann!
Why?
Thank you, Mr Schulz.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 11.42 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Welcome
Mr Valdivielso de Cu√© has the floor.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Valdivielso.
Agenda
That has not happened.
We should have had a proper debate!
(Applause)
Thursday:
Does anyone wish to speak against?
I give the floor to Mr Galeote Quecedo.
Thank you, Mr Galeote.
The Commission of Tomorrow
I have initiated reforms.
You asked about information.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is indicated in the provisions.
which must be implemented in 1999.
This is how it is defined.
But nothing has happened.
This is absolutely clear.
This applies in all countries.
(Mixed reactions) Yes!
Could you clarify this point?
This is not our intention.
Mr President, I have two questions.
Do these documents exist?
Thank you, Mr Santer.
European Council
So the Union needs new impetus.
Employment remains the first priority.
Let me begin with employment.
I must admit that they were minimal.
I for my part will name three of them.
Chief amongst these is employment.
Welcome
I welcome them to the House.
European Council (continuation)
That is a great innovative project.
What about investment in Europe?
That was confirmed in P√∂rtschach.
This decision must now to be taken.
I would like to speak on two subjects.
This is quite a major point.
It is not.
Will it resist?
What is the attitude of the Commission?
I see Commissioner van den Broek here.
That is a difficult task.
It must tackle the work now.
I fully agree with Mr Swoboda.
We have to have employability.
A debate has commenced.
Thank you, Mr Alavanos.
The debate is closed.
Applications for membership



It has a constitutional majority.
We must support it where we can.
I think that is an important point.
But that is just a comment in passing.
Of course we can only welcome this.
I shall take Slovakia first.
The rapporteur also referred to that.
Firstly, nuclear safety.
There can be no re-channelling.
We must take action there.
We must now respond to its efforts.
I should like to make one more point.
A second point concerns Romania.
I find such a remark disturbing.
We welcome what is being done.
I would strongly urge you to do so.
We welcome the Commission's reports.
So we agree on that.
The joint debate is closed.
EU/Turkey relations
You want examples of omissions?
In what country?
(The President cut the speaker off)
But what is the European Union?
What are those values?
That is the point!
I will leave it there.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Members' Statute
Thank you very much, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy.
Equal pay for equal work.
Which brings us to the first problem.
Why?
That would be utter nonsense.
So what are the other proposals?
There is another reason.
That is not realistic.
Some say there are too many details.
No, these are not trivial details.
We have heard enough fine words.
We have a problem to solve.
Politics is all about solving problems.
That is why we are here.
(Laughter and applause)
I most earnestly hope so.
That was the first success.
Of course, it should not be so.
Let us also be entirely open.
For me this is fundamental.
Time is short.
It is damaging our credibility.
He has done it.
Why do I differ?
That is indefensible.
Why such urgency?
Why such attention?
What will the Council do about it?
Of course we support the Statute.
It has our full support.
It is a travesty of transparency.
Undoubtedly we should.
Obviously not.
The Treaty on European Union tells us.
We never got one.
None of us is on the breadline yet!
His efforts deserve our gratitude.
I do not agree.
So we support Mr Rothley there.
Thank you, Mr Florio.
Thank you, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy.
The debate is closed.
External representation of Euro
Who should speak for the euro?
Let us challenge this statement.
It is not their job.
I will only give one example.
I regret this decision.
That, however, must be our objective.
Today we are on a collision course.
It should withdraw its proposal too.
Thank you, Mr de Silguy.
The debate is closed.
Monetary and financial crisis
There will always be financial crises.
These are the facts we have to discuss.
We must not forget that.
We need action. We need unambiguity.
The market too can take risks here.
Could you please acknowledge it now?
After all, it is already 11.20 p.m.
Thank you, Mr Langen.
Thank you, Mrs Randzio-Plath.
I believe this is a wise judgement.
Lastly, the third element is vigilance.
Why?
It is twofold.
Thank you, Mr de Silguy.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
However, it is a serious matter.
So far, so good.
(The Minutes were approved)
VOTES
It should be ruled inadmissible.
On Amendment No 106
They are therefore inadmissible.
On Amendment No 27
What is your position?
After the vote on Article 4
We have taken the vote, Mrs Thors.
This point is therefore closed.
That is the one and only reason!
I pointed that out before the vote.
It is a purely technical point.
That has to be possible!
This is a motion.
I stated and restated it very clearly.
I explained things quite clearly.
I cannot now go back on the vote.
(Mixed reactions)
I am very unhappy with this.
We are putting the whole issue at risk.
We have not voted on that yet.
Thank you, Mr Pasty.
I shall therefore be taking two votes.
(Parliament adopted Article 11a)
After the vote on Amendment No 26
I can put that to the vote.
That was as part of the draft Statute.
They cannot both be right.
May I draw your attention to one point.
We vote against part of the text.
That is my duty and I will keep to it.
This discussion is finished.
Before the vote on point A of the annex
I will try to explain it again.
It says:
And what is this text?
That is quite simply where we are.
On Amendment No 25
I think that is the wrong way round.
Before the vote on Amendment No 35
I quite agree with you.
After the vote on recital E
Rule 6 says so.
That sort of majority is not required.
That is not yet the case, however.
On Article 5 of the draft Statute
That point is therefore settled.
That will therefore be changed.
After the vote on paragraph 2
We need to take two votes.
On the vote on Amendment No 18
So it simply must not fall.
Please check on what it says.
I am sorry, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy.
On the vote on Amendment No 18
Let us be quite clear.
I stand by my interpretation.
I am sorry, but that is my opinion.
That is the quality we are providing.
That is not a point of order.
It is my responsibility.
It will have the final say.
But this has been adopted.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I have a question I should like to ask.
We have had a rather trying morning.
So we shall do as I suggest for today.
That is why I voted for it reluctantly.
This requires a common salary.
The transition period is illogical.

Tomlinson recommendation (A4-0436/98)
Ferri report (A4-0400/98)
For us, this is an issue beyond debate.
Caccavale report (A4-0430/98)
Bernard-Reymond report (A4-0428/98)
Wiersma report (A4-0427/98)
Kristoffersen report (A4-0431/98)
Aelvoet report (A4-0429/98)
Swoboda report (A4-0432/98)

We abstained on the Swoboda report.
Herman report (A4-0439/98)
In statutory terms, it is simple.
Randzio-Plath report (A4-0441/98)
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 1.15 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
They therefore stand adopted.
Thank you, Mr Eisma.
You are misinformed, Mr Duhamel.
I do not know the reason for his visit.
I have Parliament's resolution.
Thank you very much, Mrs van Putten.
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
It will take five minutes.
(Parliament approved the request)
Does anyone wish to speak against?
The matter has not been settled yet.
(Parliament rejected the request)
Those are the terms of Rule 162(4)
That is correct.
You are quite right.
Thank you.
I agree entirely with you, Mrs Pack.
I apologise for this.
Wednesday: no change
Thursday:
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament approved the request)
Friday: no change
Supplementary and Amending Budget 1/98
I commend it to the House.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
The interpretation reads as follows:
In Council unanimity is needed.
In Parliament majorities are needed.
For that I thank you very much indeed!
(Applause)
I personally am very angry about that.

Yes, quite right.
We are not idiots.
It is for all the other programmes.
I want to press that point most firmly.
We have worked well together.
That is what you have achieved.
Once again, thank you very much.
That should not be the outcome.
We must make the procedures shorter.
Ultimately there has to be some result.
That is forgotten again and again.
I think we have done a good job.
Now comes the real challenge.
The debate is closed.
Specific RTD programmes (1998-2002)
Research can achieve this.
These relate to five paragraphs.
Most businesses are extremely small.
The opposite is true.
That was a very valuable piece of work.
It means that this must be implemented.
This may be a promising way forward.
It has fixed costs.
We look forward to their realisation.
They are looking for export markets.
Will it please support Amendment No 19.
I can agree with almost all of them.
We can do it if we wish.
What about energy efficiency?
However, responsibility is called for!
Is that coincidence?
Surely not.
Caution is therefore advisable.
I welcome her interest.
These problems are complex.
So the Commission will adopt them.
This is also mentioned by Mrs McNally.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.50 p.m.)
Rule 162 is perfectly clear.
We shall vote at 12 noon.
It will do that at 12 noon today.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
We are therefore faced with a choice.
Who should decide?
Yes indeed, Mr Pex.
This is not mentioned.
(The Minutes were approved)
Decision on urgent procedure
If not, I shall put it to the vote.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
Discharge for 1996
I do not wish to prolong the procedure.
Thank you.
I am therefore in favour of it.
(Applause)
The responsibility is ours alone.
No, clearly not.
It only half-listened.
(Applause)
(The President cut the speaker off)
I think not.
Need we go on?
What sort of a threat is that?
That is not the issue at present.
Those are the very words you used.
Five days later he was gone.
We listed six points on 31 March.
The first point is the BATs.
There would be no sense in such a move.
The facts are clear and sufficient.
You emphasised that.
(Applause)
Which Rule are you raising this under?
(The President cut the speaker off)
The BSE crisis was at its height.
It was also a year of scandals.
This may not be enough.
So should we refuse discharge?
Yes, possibly.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is wrong.
What did the Court of Auditors say?
We must draw the right conclusion.
That is a major task.
If you are not happy, say so.
You know what I mean.
For us, not all the work has been done.
This report is on the year 1996.
Many issues come from the past.
Much remains to be done.
We have a huge task in front of us.
It is in the English version.
That is how we voted.
That will be done, Mrs Theato.
The debate is closed.
No one has it.
This is just for the record.
Others were declared inadmissible.
1999 General Budget
The latter, I think.

The Council ignored it.
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office.
It is now voting time.
Thank you, Mr Blot.
VOTES
Not everyone can say the same.

That concludes voting time.
1999 General Budget (continuation)
This is a major achievement.
A vademecum has been distributed.
I hope for the best for the future.
Mr Wynn referred to this a moment ago.
I tend to question that.
There is a very thin compromise.
Article 17 made it very clear.
We should not go back over old history.
But it is not technical for the public.
We have achieved this.
Well, the gamble failed.
You were not ready for that.
I must be open about this.
Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is right there.
It is a tight one.

I know what is going to happen now.
Parliament never opposes anyone.
That is the maximum that can be saved.
Is this a symbolic gesture?
That is a matter of principle.
And we should be delighted about this.
We have shown rigour.
But we have shown this.
We have done our part of the work.
The debate is closed.
I will begin with Agenda 2000.
The first is public health.
Why is this necessary?
There are, in fact, three.
We each have our own role to play.
They remained out of sight.
Very little has been done.
There is blame on both sides.
That is what I think.
So I think we have a lot to do here.
What progress are we making there?
Firstly, where is Europe going?
There is also Amsterdam to consider.
After that came Vietnam and Thailand.
Calves were turned into bonemeal.
That is the Christmas miracle.
Thank you very much.
There is just one problem.
I wish you every success with this.
The key word is Agenda 2000.
Mr Santer, we do not need one!
And I could continue.
I will stop there.
The Commission works as a college.
These must be looked at together.
Agenda 2000 is the main issue.
Unemployment is falling.
Why are we two reports behind schedule?
Question Time (Commission)
The hardware is very varied.
We cannot do any more.
We really cannot do any more than that.
Two years on, still no action.
This principle is obviously in force.
Subject: Trafficking in women in Europe
I shall recall some of them briefly.
Thank you very much for your question.
Subject: Illegal immigration
Thank you, Mrs Gradin.
That seems fine to me, Mr Van Miert.
Then we shall not break the order.
Subject: Mergers in the bus sector
Subject: Discriminatory fares
Occasionally there might be a cartel.
I welcome the Commissioner's reply.
People like it.
There is another question about Sabena.
I can reassure him on that point.
We do not discriminate on fares.
That is not the case.
Firstly, there must be no mistake.
There is no doubt on that point.
It works both ways.
This must be clear.
That is the stage we are at now.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I shall return to the subject later.
Thank you, Mr Otila.
Information strategy on euro
What does this mean?
You are familiar with the problem.
Public opinion also counts.
That too is natural!
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
That is really what my report is about.
How will EMU function?
Why?
So what can we do?
We do not believe this.
Such shocks exist in our Member States.
This will require much more work yet.
Medical supplies are urgently needed.
Firstly, what is an asymmetric shock?
However, this was not the case.
This is an asymmetric shock absorber.
The scope of this text is very clear.
The text is worded wisely.
He has said nothing on that.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Trading of goods between Member States
This does not seem unreasonable to me.
Mrs Lulling, we cannot have a debate.
You may only ask a question.
The debate is closed.
External transit
Firstly, an administrative note.
They have now changed that.
Of course they are talking.
We shall keep a watchful eye on things.
These rules must be clearly defined.
I welcome this report.
Thank you, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
It is a very necessary report.
That is one aspect of it.
There are very few alternatives.
We have to keep that separate.
It now has an opportunity to do so.
Thank you, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
Emergency food aid to Russia
Thank you, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.51 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
There were no objections.
Thank you very much for your remarks.
Thank you, Mr Puerta.
She is coming in to Frankfurt airport.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Let us follow our Rules correctly.
One moment, Mr Casini.
I do not know.
That is all I can say.
(The Minutes were approved)
Welcome
The next item is the joint debate on:
The second point is enlargement.
The third point is monetary union.
It is a good and inclusive process.
Vienna was the first of such meetings.
Thank you, Mr Santer.
Mr Haarder has a point of order.
Why have we heard nothing about it?
It is an historic turning-point.
Europe has shown a high profile here.
That is an absolute necessity!
It was not a very easy task.
We initiated these negotiations.
I think that is quite essential.
We discussed important issues together.
We know that.
But this too remains an open question.
I would like to congratulate Mr Klima.
We offer our thanks.
Let us be frank and clear about that.
We have our negotiating team ready.
It is political will that matters.
Amsterdam did that.
Mr Rothley did that.
And you did that.
Together we can do that.
Frankly, we must succeed.
Mrs Green reminded us of it.
My heartfelt gratitude to you.
This drift in policy terms has to stop.
This is a good idea.
And what did the Vienna summit do?
Believe me, they can do it better!
Where shall we put them?
A third aspect is adaptability.
Retraining is part and parcel of that.
We must certainly emphasise that.
That sent out a positive signal.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I would certainly not dispute that.
Perhaps that was a better system.
I do not dispute that.
Yes, we were expecting more.
This is the new political dimension.
When, then, Mr President?
I find this alarming.
We are not on the right track.
That is the way it is!
That is a real about-turn.
What does that mean?
Good luck and thank you.
(Applause)

The same applies to enlargement.
It is to be welcomed.
They know what is expected of them.
This is a political decision.
But there are no concrete agreements.
There is nothing further we can add.
But we have had enough discussions now.
Worse still, it was actually a failure.
I find that somewhat amazing.
The debate is closed.
Human rights in the world
Suharto and others watch out.
But we also need political will.
This has been approved in the report.
These are good opinions.
I have just one or two points to make.
I want to guard against that.
Then there is the political aspect.
Really, I give up.
Can you see it? The light blue bits?
That really was another master stroke!
But what is the real situation?
But all of that is happening today.
Why?
This is a case in point.
The list of 'whys' could go on and on.
Is this a matter of fate?
Of course not.
So constant follow-up work is needed.
We shall do that as well.
The joint debate is closed.
Human rights in the Union
Our credibility is at stake here.
Did we have anything to do with it?
I do not know whether we did or not.
I simply welcome the result.
Such is the freedom of expression.
This is most regrettable.
What should we do?
It will be resumed at 9.00 p.m.
Question Time (Council)
Let me explain again.
Any other option would be less good.
Subject: Accession of Cyprus
It happened as far back as 1976.
I believe it is possible.
Subject: Western Sahara
Subject: Referendum in Western Sahara

That is my answer, Mr President.
Thank you!
That is what I have to say in reply.
Let us be perfectly clear about this.
I think the people deserve that.
This area has been occupied!
That is my supplementary question.
But I have already said all that.
Why was there no troika mission?
Thank you, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner.
Thank you very much, Mr Valverde.
Much remains to be done.
That is the heart of the matter.
Thank you, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner.
It is not really good enough any more.
So what is just?
That is what we think, anyway.
I believe it is our task to wake it.
The debate is closed.
Prison conditions
It is no good for winning votes.
Today, prison is a necessary evil.
Who is in prison?
I will tell you who is in prison.
But who are they?
And that is quite something, I think.
Mr Pradier speaks of a necessary evil.
That was the thrust of our amendment.

But that is quite another matter.
These are important issues.
The debate is closed.
This is acceptable thus far.
I consider this to be unacceptable.
This is generally what will happen.
I commend that to the House.
We do not think that is necessary.
The Council has now improved the texts.
How realistic is this?
Do they know about that at Oxfam?
Mrs Kuhn has made things much worse.
This is more law and worse law.
The debate is closed.
CO2 emissions from new passenger cars
Traffic is an example here.
Nor can we accept Amendment No 34.
The debate is closed.
This idea is not a new one.
We cannot accept this.
The debate is closed.
Depletion of the ozone layer
My final point concerns methyl bromide.
This shows what it is all about.
Such a possibility should be exploited.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Agenda
I have no problem with that.
(Mixed reactions)
You do not have the floor, Mrs Moreau.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mr Gallagher.
Thank you, Mrs Miranda.
This is incorrectly recorded.
The company is named simply Xerox.
Thank you, Mr Metten.
We shall check on that.
(The Minutes were approved)
VOTES
Yes indeed, Mr Samland.
(Sustained applause)
Thank you, Mr Wynn, for those remarks.
But I think that can be rectified.
Is that not correct?
Is that so?
I see paragraph 23 reads as follows:
We have a decision and a resolution.
Before the vote on paragraph 23
Mr Martens has the floor.
We do not agree with this.
That is the meaning of our vote.
That would be the right thing to do.
(Applause from the right)
We challenge them to do that!
We find such action unacceptable.
(Applause from the centre and right)
So the procedural issue is quite clear.
Finally, on the political question.
We are not all in agreement.
Mr President, I have two comments.
I put paragraph 23 to the vote.
(Mixed reactions)
We believe it is ...
(Mixed reactions)
I say the same to the rapporteur.
It has been referred back to committee.
We cannot vote again.
It will go back to the committee now.
There were two opinions.
The position is the same.
Therefore, we must have separate votes.
(Parliament rejected the amendment)
We are very pleased about this.
We know what we want in future.
Let us therefore be vigilant.

Graenitz report (A4-0465/98)
Therefore we cannot support them.
Look at what you voted on.
Many people doubt that they will.
Nothing was planned beyond then.
It is not the whole Agreement.
Roubatis report (A4-0409/98)
Barros Moura report (A4-0410/98)
Schaffner report (A4-0468/98)

With pleasure, Mrs Lulling.
Mr Elliott has the floor.
Thank you for clarifying the position.
Agenda
Mr Hallam has asked for the floor.
I do not think so.
Topical and urgent debate
Who is this Saddam Hussein?
We know how sensitive the region is.
The UNSCOM report was damning.
But it has an even more urgent impact.
They have a choice.
We have exhausted all other avenues.
We act because we must.'
Why?
Perhaps that is too simplistic.
I suspect not.
UNSCOM will not be returning.
Saddam Hussein will not be affected.
Support the opposition?
This is the reality of the situation.
He is undoubtedly a tyrant.
I am about to conclude, Mr President.
This barbaric dictator must go.
He is a tyrant.
What crime has Iraq committed?
What is Saddam Hussein asking for?
To stand up and be counted?
Who is a tyrant in the Middle East?
Saddam Hussein?
Where is the peacekeeping operation?
To whom has the matter been referred?
Europe is staking its credibility.
The Arab nation is watching Europe.
Long live Iraq.

I have to stop you there, Mr Parigi.

That is repeatedly ignored here.
Thank you, Mr Pinheiro.

Ten heads are better than one!
But the ICO cannot do this alone.
The Commission has a responsibility.
Europe has a responsibility.
This is a very important resolution.
It is a very good resolution.
It is very comprehensive.
This is the key.
This is a real attack on human health.
Fortunately this has not come about.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Welcome
Death penalty
There is one positive aspect.
She too was condemned to death.
And they are sure to be here now.
We must keep up the pressure.
Sudan
But it is not enough.
Mr President, Mr Bertens knows Sudan.
I do not know the country.
Above all, I find it rather selective.
They also apply to the Sudan.
I believe this has to be changed.
Pakistan
It was apparently a family vendetta.
Violence in Karachi has increased.
Iran
Well, do not worry.
This was hardly a coincidence.
That must not be forgotten.
Mr President, we live and learn!
Nobody has yet been arrested for them.
Child soldiers
Now we have the Ottawa Convention.
We learned this lesson from Ottawa.
Some of them are only eight years old.
To these words ...

The EU must act accordingly.
The joint debate is closed.
VOTES
But closed centres for refugees do.
No, Mr President.
Okay.
Thank you.
Are there any objections?
Let's not have a debate.
The amendment is clear.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
On a point of order, Mr President.
The system is in crisis.
However, much more remains to be done.
For example:
This clearly favours the wealthy.
Inmates will be held in triple cells.
That concludes the vote.
Racism and xenophobia
and
This is important.
To my shame, it is a British group.
This is what is difficult.
I am curious to hear its proposals.
Positive discrimination is absurd.
Has it somehow been reduced?
We must not do that!
These are across the board.
Why?
We should not ignore them
I turn to the report.
Thank you, Mr Pinheiro.
The debate is closed.
It is a growing market.
This is not a satisfactory option.
Thank you, Mr Pinheiro.
The debate is closed.
Better law-making (1997 report)
This is extremely urgent, Commissioner.
But who lays down the criteria?
Please do not misunderstand me!
Law-making is like angling.

What did this plan involve?
What were its aims?
How is the plan laid out?
What conclusions can we draw from this?
What is to be done, as Lenin would say?
Secondly, it establishes two phases.
That is a disadvantage.
Today we are going a stage further.
Mr President, I welcome this report.
Thank you very much, Mr Papoutsis.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.

This must be dealt with now.
We may wish we had.

This surely is natural justice.

Take the euro.
Zero tolerance must be applied.
They do not count.

This is healthy in any democracy.

There is much to be done.
The birth of the euro is a success.
This too is a question of confidence.
That was a serious matter then.
It would be a catastrophe now.
So we have to reach agreement.
Action has to follow.
It will take place in Tampere, Finland.

Preparation of these is well in hand.

Madam President, I will be very brief.
Why is this?
How is this to be clarified?
Mr Santer, you put us in a dilemma.
We shall study them with great care.
I have a question, however.
What is the story here?
Applause
Yours too, Mr Santer!
Do what has to be done.
You have until Thursday.
Applause
These patterns are always the same.
But you always perform a cover-up.
Let us talk about responsibility.
We want more Europe.
No, everything is classified!
She will be receiving it very soon.
What is a TAO?
Heckling
On a point of order, Mr President.
That is what I did.
It is a fact.
That is a tricky matter.
The President has suggested a formula.
Let us discuss it.
Let us study it.
But part of the work has been done.
Part of it still needs to be done.
You have known me for a long time.
I may have made a lot of mistakes.

Let me make a final remark.
Heckling
Applause
I wish you every success there.
Applause
There can be no doubt about that.
We have seen that this week.
Applause
We have just heard you speak.
Applause from various quarters
But how much substance?
They cannot be solved by words alone.
We have serious doubts about that.
Would that we were proved wrong.
We do not question that.
That is anything but easy.
Applause
The same will be true in future!
Applause
To come back to Agenda 2000.
That is simply not on!
Applause
So do give us a little help here.
On the contrary!
What does the European idea mean?
That is a difficult process.
This has to stop!
Applause
You cannot go on like that!
Applause
Mr President, on a point of order.
So how can you draw such a conclusion?
Laughter
Laughter
Let me just say that at the outset.
But that is their problem, not mine!
What reforms are needed in agriculture?
More equality, more equal rights.
Applause
That is a majority.
Heckling
Applause
That is certainly one example.
Applause
That would close the circle.
Applause
We hope so.
But how should it be tackled?
Is this the right approach?
I think not.
That opened a new era for Europe.
Here we find some concern being voiced.
I do not think that is inconceivable.
Sadly we saw all that again in Bosnia.
Europe cannot allow that to happen.
We must not forget that.
We want Europe!
We have common interests.
Applause
There are no changes here.
Applause
That is a key point.
How can we do so?
That would be absurd.
That is all past history.
Applause
Heckling
We must not forget that.
Maastricht changed all that.
It is important to remember that.
That precludes any renationalisation.
That is the second important point.
We have to discuss them.
National preferences differ.
Laughter
But who indeed can perform miracles?
Applause
I forgive you!
Applause
You must admit that too!
That is an enormous problem.
Thirdly, what is the aim?
Secession?
But what does secession mean?
Today the situation is different.
But we have tried.
You must realise that too.
The debate is closed.
Transparency in the European Union
Much remains to be done.
Transparency means clarity.
The second aspect is the substance.
This concludes my comments.
I would like to give two examples.
My group will vote for their report.
That is the real aim.
Applause
The debate is closed.
The vote will follow immediately.

L√∂√∂w Report (A4-0476/98)
Who makes the rules?
That is all very well.
How can we improve that?
That concludes the vote.
I do not have much to add.
Its name is democracy.
Europe needs this rule.
Towards a presidential democracy?
Towards a federal system?
Much has happened since then.
It needs to be examined carefully.
It must come about as soon as possible.
There is no question about that.

Europe Agreements

And they must be helped to do so.
Why does my paint have to be inspected?
I should like to support this view.
But may I just make one point.
The debate is closed.
There have been all sorts of problems.
It contains no trade concessions.
Interruption by Mrs Malone

Question Time (Commission)
Mr Monti has the floor.
There are three parts to this article.
There should be clear parallelism.
I hope that clarifies my position.
This formality has to be completed.
Thank you, Mr Fischler.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I did approach several public channels.
Well, I was concerned about Euronews.
How could the procedure be improved?
So what else has happened?
This is how things stand at the moment.
I cannot invent the Treaty.
The Treaty exists and I am bound by it.
But my powers are limited.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Thank you very much.
Action should be taken.
However, I would ask him to go further.
Thank you, Mr Kinnock.
They have said so repeatedly.
This, therefore, is where we differ.
Thank you, Mrs Bonino.
I will check it out.
Thank you, Commissioner.
That concludes Question Time.
This is the only solution.
A second conclusion suggests itself.
Excesses are sometimes unhealthy.
But does it really come as a surprise?
That country is Moldova.
There can be no alternative.
The debate is closed.
That had been disputed for many years.
That is our first priority.
You should do that more often.
I would stress two further points here.
In short, it is within our means.
Reliable and comparable information.
But we must take care!
I should like to make five points.
Hence our question.
Thank you, Mr Kinnock.
Mr President, the same goes for me.
I would welcome that.
That is another issue, Mr Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
Electronic signatures
This should keep us in suspense.
So I look forward to that.
That is perfectly reasonable.

Are there any other comments?
There are not.
The Minutes were approved
Communication on the 1996 discharge
The statement reads as follows:
Agenda 2000
Otherwise it will not survive.
So far, the committee agrees.
The two usually go hand in hand.
That seems to me to be very sensible.
Thank you, Madam President.
I must insist!
Applause
Our rapporteurs do an important job.
I may be wrong, but I do not do it!
I do not think that would be sensible.
Applause
Let me start with financing.
A slimmed-down reform could do neither.
That is why it does not make sense.
Applause
You have anticipated events somewhat.
Yes sir, God willing, I will be there!
Laughter
We cannot accept that.
This is an integrated policy.
This is only partly related to price.
Someone in the middle is profiteering.
It is high time Parliament was told.
This all remains a mystery.
Holdings need to prepare for this.
That concerns Germany in particular.
This should be clarified.
Holdings need to have security.
We do not want a closed shop.
The state must stay out of this.
More should be done here!
Perhaps your courage has deserted you.
We wanted to reach a compromise.
Chaos was the only result.
You should bear that in mind too.
We are in agreement with that support.
We should not go down that road.
Do not tie farmers' hands any more.
Perhaps he should show them to me.
Where the environment is being damaged?
Can you?
Heckling
Grain too has to be dried.
This would lead to virtual farming.
In my view they are not crying 'wolf'.
We have the means to do so.
Is this really your aim?
Is this really our aim?
We are in a state of political penury.
I have a few comments to make.
The USA has shown this for many years.
Thank you, Mrs Raschhofer.

Sepp√§nen report (A4-0443/98)

Sainjon report (A4-0423/98)
We have to have standards for trade.
Danesin report (A4-0372/98)
Jarzembowski report (A4-0375/98)
We are all agreed on that.
Langenhagen report (A4-0413/98)
Agenda 2000 (continuation)
The President cut the speaker off
We would like clarification on this.
It is an interesting option.
The problems are with the people.
Some people will have regrets.
But I have no regrets.
We also have some other amendments.
Re-distribution must ensure fairness.
Agricultural policy demands reform.
We are totally opposed to that.
Farm incomes have dwindled.
But we often neglect them.
Nevertheless, we have helped them.
In conclusion, we need reform.
The Commission proposals are logical.
But they are also very blunt.
It is truly incredible.
This cannot be allowed.
The time for questions is long past.
Mr Funk said the same this morning.
Then we will be in agreement.
I welcome that.
We have a policy that works.
So I thank you for your contributions.
I understand and accept all of that.
I would like to add the following.
Applause
I would like to discuss this with him.
Note: the last 50 years.
We must be realistic here.
That would really be a mistake.
I now come to the issue of financing.
We are prepared to look into them.
Thank you, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
Organic production
This shift relates to three areas.
I fully agree with you on this.
One side called for fifteen years.
In any case that is how I see it.
But that is not the issue here.
Other countries can join in later.
That is it, really.
What is the current situation?
This is therefore a ban.
This is where we begin to weaken.
It is in your hands.
So what should be done?
But perhaps it is already in the text.
The second question concerns GMO.
Thank you, Mr Fischler.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)

I have two supplementary questions.
They may not be able to achieve that.
You are aware of the current situation.
He was taken to hospital with a cut.
I really think this is a good start.
It was agreed in Vienna.
Your information is indeed correct.
It could not be found.
The list is nowhere to be found.
Thank you very much, Mrs Maes.
Yes, it was interpreted.
The last time was yesterday.
I agree that it is very difficult.
I completely agree with Mr Martin.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
Unfortunately that is the situation.
It is a very serious matter.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
This is a very difficult issue.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
That concludes Question Time.
Thank you very much.
That is a good example from colleagues.
Perhaps we will not go beyond midnight.
Let me explain why.
I would make one point, however.
What happens now, Commissioner?
This is what concerns me.
But even here we must be careful.
This is why we have battled over this.
I have to say that in all honesty.
It could not be ignored.
And there are established rights.
And that is what was agreed.
The debate is closed.
Right to deduct VAT
That is true harmonisation.
That is too high a price to pay.
This is to be welcomed.
They represent genuine progress.
I agree with what Mr Metten said.
The debate is closed.
This is a valid question.
What can Parliament do?
This brings me on to my final point.
Obviously, there must be cooperation.
These are good signs, I feel.
Thank you very much, Mr Lukas.
Laughter and applause
Thank you, Mr Bangemann.
We all share in that hope.
The debate is closed.
We have to protect the weak.
We must fasten rules around ourselves.
We in the EPP would support that too.
It is a rather messy and confused one.
Thank you, Mr Monti.
You have one minute, Mrs Larive.
Thank you, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
European postal services



That is social policy at its best.
Things cannot go on like this.
Heckling: It was not delivered!
That may well be so.
Parliament knows I am a reasonable man.
Thank you, Mr Simpson.
That deadline has been allowed to pass.
What an interesting thought!
However, this has not been done.
Thank you, Mr Stenmarck.
And how could it be?
This is not about ideology.
Thank you, Mr Bangemann.
The debate is closed.
The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
We take note of that.
The Minutes were approved
Article K.6 EU; Schengen cooperation
The next item is the joint debate on:
Thank you, Mrs Van Lancker.
My next subject is EU enlargement.
We will continue that practice.
I shall now turn to my second point.

Thank you, Mr Elliott.

We find that unacceptable.
Who are we protecting against whom?
What does illegal mean in the EU?
Thank you, Madam President-in-Office.

I will now conclude, Mr President.
There is still a long way to go.
That is unacceptable.

That is not correct.
I would like that to be minuted.
There were none.
I congratulate it.
What have we done?
What have we done?
We have done three things.
That is not a brave thing to do.
What will happen next, I wonder?
The Commission cannot ignore this vote.
Obviously, I deplore this.
There is a great deal at stake.
But better late than never.
And that is what has happened.
Remedial action is called for.
Thank you, Mr Happart.
I have three points to make.
The President cut the speaker off
This is not acceptable.
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
This is rash and ill considered.
We must get to grips with this.
It contains many excellent proposals.
This is insufficient.
So what further progress can we expect?
Applause
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office.
Mr Mendes Bota has the floor.
The joint debate is closed.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
I believe that sums up our concern.
We in the Greens deplore the bombing.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
That is the current situation.
Thank you, Mr Nordmann.
You have the floor, Mr Newens.
We must try, however.
Mr Telk√§mper has a point of order.
We are desperately short of time.
Mr President, I can be brief.
That is a credible approach.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 5.30 p.m.
East Timor and Indonesia
Western Sahara
I could not let that go unsaid.
How can we help the Secretary-General?
Trafficking of children in Guatemala
The threat is already there.
It is now high time it did.
I urge everyone to bear that in mind.
Peace process in Colombia
Yet this has just not happened.
Sierra Leone
Not at all.
We must therefore redress the balance.
So we should provide this funding.
The President cut the speaker off
Mr Mar√≠n, do you wish to respond?
I was not referring to that in any way.
That is what I meant.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 5.30 p.m.
That is a political necessity.
They are part of this process.
We are not used to that here.
That was the point I raised.
But that is a political issue.
Thank you, Mr Telk√§mper.
The message has been heard.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.
We should all be clear about this.
Ireland has suffered as much as any.
I spoke to Xerox this week.
They have moved a little.
We have no such criticisms.
So there is a serious mistake there.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.

That was an extended family.
There are many ideas.
Probably in the family environment.
Thank you, Mr Mar√≠n.

A model code of conduct is a necessity.

Ways towards a sustainable agriculture
Commissioner Bjerregaard has the floor.
My other example ...
The President cut the speaker off
So your hypothesis is not correct.
You agree with this, I know for a fact.
What does ...
The President cut the speaker off
They are three different categories.
That is my first question.
Mr President, I have two questions.
Today this figure is 5 %.
Moreover ...
The President cut the speaker off
When is that going to improve?
That is what we are doing.
The consumer decides on price.
I hope I can get a satisfactory answer.
I believe that biodiversity is vital.
That concludes this item.
Defence-related industries
In 1985 the ratio was 4: 1.
Of course, there has been progress.
We have had the setting up of OCCAR.
We must use all our resources.
This, after all, is a global industry.
That is still on the agenda!
This is also true in defence matters.
My compliments to him.
We are living in a post-cold war era.
Europe is surrounded only by friends.
This is an age of peace.
It is the age of disarmament.
For the rest, I have other priorities.
That is the right road.
Why?
We have to demand that it is!
Applause
That is my first point.
That will not get us any further.
The same applies to the Airbus.
The problem there is quite simple.
It would be naive to disregard that.
Sadly, that is not an option.
Standardisation is the first aspect.
The debate is closed.
All that is lacking is political will.
That is a mistake.
We ought to focus on the basic points.
You can see that in the Kola Peninsula.
This applies to paragraphs 18 and 29.
The debate is closed.
Comprehensive partnership with China
Mr Dupuis is right.
They are not isolated from each other.
They disrupt and increase poverty.
Both sides bear a great responsibility.
They have no basis in reality.
So what is the statement doing?
No such thing!
And yet the crisis still occurred.
But why are you closing your eyes?
Why?
Why can you not see that?
He has drafted a very good report.
The adoption of the report is timely.
Both poles of the policy are necessary.
That applies to Hong Kong as well.
Thank you, Sir Leon.
The debate is closed.
Regional policy and competition policy
This is discussed in paragraph 10.
We need these good solutions quickly.
We want to have a constructive say now.
That is national state aid.
Why do we need to do that?
That distorts competition.
I do not think that would be logical.
This is all I ask.
I am in your hands.
There is no other solution.
We must be sure of what we want.
This is how the situation stands.
This much is clear.
It allows for a broader based approach.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Climate change
In fact, you were much wiser than that.
I should like to emphasise two points.
It is for us to pay.
I think that is a fair description.
So, it is a good resolution.
I do not think so.
That was a welcome development.
It is clear that this cannot go on.
Thank you, Mr Pimenta.
Thank you, Mrs Bjerregaard.

Food treated with ionising radiation
Not even radiation can do that.
It is a very important principle.
It might have come more quickly.
It will not be the last.
Why?
Protest
Oh I see, you have put your jacket on.
That is the view of the Commission too.
That is unacceptable.
Duplicity kills democracy!
Just a brief comment, Mr President.
That was all I said.
The debate is closed.
Aid to ACP banana producers
But let us move on to the bananas.
That, in my opinion, is hypocrisy.
We are toeing the US line.
Let us take diversification.
It is a short-term measure.
This will create expectations.
And so we did.
That we cannot do.
The debate is closed.
Universal telecommunications service
I tried to change my telephone.
Next, the disabled.
I would like to go further than that.
These vary widely.
But that is now in the past.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Public procurement
We must recognise these.
We wait with bated breath.
This point is important.
There are a couple of issues here.
I spoke to Mr Monti outside.
That is only right.
But at what cost?
In principle, that is a good thing.
That is what is behind Amendment No 1.
Mr Tappin is absolutely right.
Protests
The debate is closed.
Jobs of the future
He mentioned small businesses.
He also mentioned the need to learn.
No new deeds.
The Liberal Group supports this report.
It is time to act!
It can, however, do two things.
Opportunities abound.
All we have to do is take them.
What are jobs with a future?
That is not even a difficult task.
Such workforces do not grow on trees.
So much for my basic analysis.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Protection for laying hens
These are only minimum standards.
I think we have helped to remedy that.
The President cut the speaker off
And about time too!
That future is free-range production.
In Britain it works.
I think he has produced a good report.
There is one thing we do not like.
Profit margins are low.
That must be the bottom line.
And battery farming cannot be healthy.
We should be more ambitious than that.
All eggs should be fresh.
Egg labelling will be mandatory.
So this amendment too is acceptable.
Thank you, Commissioner.

Landfill of waste
That is a very big switch indeed.
Think about it.
Four Parliaments hence at least.
But who decides the level of taxation?
That is one of the major problems.
That is unacceptable.
I support this view.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
I am very happy to support this report.
We are proud of our record.
What does this mean?
Who is producing this waste?
Is it the individual, the citizen?
I welcome Mrs Jackson's report.
There is no one simple answer.
Let us exploit what materials we can.
But I will not dwell on that.
I share these views.
I will comment on them individually.
I agree with the aim of this amendment.
It was not clear to me.
We can accept Amendment No 11.

We shall investigate the matter.
Taxation of energy products
This is not a CO2 tax directive.

Progress is in fact being made.
That is the real problem.
I very much hope it is.
Thank you, Mr Monti.

The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Taxation of savings income
We can do something about this.
I have three points.
The possibilities are there.
I think it is.
We should not confuse the two strands.
Some suggested 15 %.
Have negotiations really begun?
How will they develop?
When can we expect to see some results?
I do not really believe this.
My country is one of them.
That is the goal we have set ourselves.

Landfill is necessary in some cases.
We must accept that.
Stricter controls are necessary.
Cox report (A4-0015/99)
We supported Amendment No 29.
This is a good way to proceed.
That concludes voting time.
The debate is closed.
This is a highly controversial issue.
Here, I have to make a confession.
That is certainly not true.
We wish to adopt a political stance.
Do we need anything else?
Is it really in anyone's interest?
It is a clone.
This is completely inaccurate.
This would obviously be absurd.
Let us never forget that.
Let us be honest.
I would urge you to examine the law.
It lies in the Commission proposal.
Copyright is one of them.
So what is involved?
What ought to be done?
What is the purpose of that provision?
This was because of time constraints.
The debate is closed.
That is not the case here!
At that time, Parliament was split.
It is right to make it voluntary.

But that is not what we want!
What are these principal demands?

Once again, it is a question of habit.
In any case, the system works.

We must be vigilant.
We will answer all calls.
You have the floor, Commissioner.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Please remain with this question.
Thank you, Commissioner.
What is your position on this?
Thank you, Mr van den Broek.
Thank you, Mrs Bjerregaard.
Dounreay is in my constituency.
I must now move on to Question No 60.
That is what Mr Smith suggested.
I am quite disgusted.
But we should not be overly optimistic.
Do not forget that.
That is the right way to go.

They produce wine.
So we should allow carry-over.
Can you comment on this?
Thank you, Mr Fischler.

Crossing of EU external borders
The next item is the joint debate on:
To me, this seems somewhat utopian.
Such a situation is unacceptable.
The result must be obvious.
Harmonisation is therefore desirable.
That should be dealt with separately.

Madam President, I have decided.
I am taking pains to do this.
It is.
I for my part will not do so.
The President cut the speaker off
In my view, this is what will happen.
We need first to put this into context.

We will therefore support his report.
It is not a threat to employment.
That is complete nonsense!
I now come to the crux of the matter.
The first is qualified majority voting.
The debate is closed.
Decision-making in Council

This is an important point.
That is all I have to say.
That is why reform is essential.
It was very difficult.
Arithmetically that cannot happen.
And that is indeed welcome.
We could not agree more.
On this much we are all agreed.
But is this really the case?
It is consistent and very coherent.
I endorse that view also.
This is a fundamental point.
However, I must mention two points.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Strengthening EU institutions
However, this has come about at a cost.
Rather, it must be reversed.
We have only started the common area.
There is no other way.
We are in danger of going too far.
The answer is a resounding nothing!
Thank you, Commissioner.

Do you see any virtue in this?
I fear this is not so.
That is certainly not excessive.
We understand the farmers' concerns.
How can that be acceptable?
Nor do they want to understand it.
We agree with that.
Will the Cohesion Fund be maintained?
I have noted down 83 questions.
Do I have 83 minutes' speaking time?
No.
And that is what we will do.
The same applies elsewhere.

Mr President, on a point of order.
At present, it really does not work!
Situation in Kosovo
Let me briefly repeat the key points.
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office.
Thank you, Commissioner.
So the NATO threat is indispensable.
We will need ground forces then too.
That is nearly a year ago.
Let us continue to do so.
We have set a timetable.
That is the point.
Heckling by Mrs Pack
Yes, it was a German Government!
That is an entirely different matter.
That is a very, very ambitious project.
The debate is closed.
In the first place, that is unworthy.
The debate is closed.
Coffee and chicory extracts
That was in September.
What do the amendments involve?
That appears to be a technical matter.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
The present trend is unacceptable.
Thank you for that reply.
It is too soon to do so today.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
Russian prisons are overcrowded.
That was the Council's intention.
Does the Council share this view?
I am sure you will understand that.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
If you did, you are wrong.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
There is no link between them.
Many thanks for your reply.
Thank you, Mr Crowley.
There are buses that are accessible.
They are in use in London.
So this is disgraceful.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
Is that not possible?
That is what concerns me.
I reject this criticism.
I have nothing to add on the matter.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
Of course I will answer this question.
Thank you for answering my question.
It seems to be fact.
Mr Killilea, I will give you an answer.
I do not know where we stand.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
That concludes Question Time.
Water policy
It must therefore be safeguarded.
That is in itself a success.
You know what I am criticising.
It is quite incomprehensible.
The proposal makes that clear.
The President cut the speaker off
But it will be more than just that.
The President cut the speaker off
The debate is closed.
Deliberate release of GMOs
This is all very good.
What is the PPE Group's standpoint?
The President cut the speaker off
We have proposed a seven-year period.
But a White Paper is not a directive.
That means it would still take years.
That really is absurd.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
End-of-life vehicles
And in some areas it is very strict.
That is a fallacy.
Jobs will be lost.
I believe that is the wrong approach.
I do not think this is acceptable!
Some people want to ban PVC.
I cannot judge the merits of that.
I am not an expert in chemistry.
The first is the issue of leaded steel.
It is the principle that concerns me.
Let me tell him, that is total rubbish!
So we are taking a more stringent line.
So we must be consistent.
The President cut the speaker off
That brings us to PVC.
In fact, they do not think that at all.
The debate is closed.
That is indeed its right.
There are several reasons for this.
The issue goes far beyond bananas.
Two wrongs do not make a right.
The answer is certainly Yes.
What will we do if action is taken?
It will be difficult for them.
The debate is closed.
The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m.
Applause
One such area is space research.
I am a friend of Israel too.
I even have family in Israel.
There are two aspects to this report.
He is, of course, still in jail.
What has this cooperation become today?
We should not punish those people.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Ship-generated waste and cargo residues
So far so good.
Why?
This operates on two levels.
First, monitoring at ports of call.
And I mean this quite sincerely.
There are two problems.
Of course it must be paid for.
Of course it is not free of charge.
After all, we do not get hold of them.
There must be a 50 % inspection rate.
This is far from easy.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.
But why?
So we agree on the aim.
That cannot be our line.
It is the wrong way to proceed.
Mr President, I shall be very brief.
It will be resumed this evening.
This is an extremely important matter.
We shall now move on to the votes.

Sadly, I will not be here to see it.
That omission has now been put right.

Statement by the President
I understand that the answer is No.
As I say, I am learning as I go along.
That is the real political explanation.
That is the whole explanation.
That is not just a marginal incentive.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

The situation today is as follows.
Procedures must be clear.

EAGGF: recovery of claims
Madam President, on a point of order.
I ask for your clarification.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I seek your guidance again.
The President cut the speaker off
Everyone might start to do that!
We know that any freedom can be abused.
This strikes me as unfair.
This is a good report, Madam President.
Where do we find oases?
In the desert, of course.
Madam President, on a point of order.
Please switch them off!
Laughter
Thank you, Mr Bangemann.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
European standardisation
I support it on that.
But we want modern legislation.
I am thinking of the USA and Japan.
We meet with them at regular intervals.
The last time was just two weeks ago.
No standards which are mandatory!
That is the system.
Now to your individual points.
So in principle all that is being done.
So they do nothing about it.
We are the world leader here!
Thank you, Mr Bangemann.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Before the vote on paragraph 5
That warning will be noted.
Parliament adopted the resolution


We do not need to change those.
Thank you, Mr Bangemann.

The agenda was approved in Strasbourg.
Parliament agreed to this proposal
And thirdly, before the final vote.
We utterly condemn the use of violence.
I agree.
Let me try to contribute to this.
We will support it in that.
We support that position too.

What can our Union do?
We did not have this before.
That is not the case at present.
We were to be their shield.
They told of serious torture.

You have spoken out quite clearly here.
That is what I regret most.
I agree with him.
The end can never justify the means.
Their lives are in danger.
That seems a little strange to me.
Thank you, Mr van den Broek.

Draft agreement with South Africa
What has Europe done?
Mr Pinheiro stuck his neck out.
The talks have taken four years.
It was a very difficult dossier.
We knew that.
Are we to be shamed yet again?
Mr Mandela has tried his best.
That is one point.
Europe must not miss this opportunity.
Both sides have made compromises.
In any case, it is a minuscule market.
Spain raised problems with agriculture.
Applause
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office.
The debate is closed.
So it is in our hands.
Thank you for your attention.
Mr Grosch is mistaken on one point.
We must be careful not to get it wrong.
How do we harmonise?
That is what we should be discussing.
Otherwise, they are meaningless.
Thank you, Mr Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
Why?
What has Turkey's response been?
I have no illusions about this at all.
I am not aware of any.
That is absurd!
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Socrates programme (second phase)
Basically we know it all.
They are educated for Europe in Europe.
It is in their interest to do so.
So we need more money.
I assume you will join me in this!
Applause
Why is this programme so popular?
It is important that they do.
That is my first point.
It makes it real for them.
The key point is the funding.
But what is EUR 2.5 billion?
Thank you, Mrs Cresson.
The debate is closed.
Tobacco taxes
Young people go for lighter cigarettes.
We welcome his committee's proposal.
They are the smokers of the future.
That misguided incentive has to end.
Tobacco and smoking cause harm.
I really cannot follow that at all.
Thank you, Mrs Cresson.
The debate is closed.
But he will not be forgotten.
It has failed to protect fish stocks.
There are many different meanings.
Mr Gallagher has offered a ray of hope.
This is recognised.
The aims were great.
It was wonderful.
There are many examples.
I would question Mr Novo's amendments.
Ms McKenna mentioned that.
But I go further.
That is why I like this report.
What is wrong with that?
That is what we need.
That is not always clear to them.
I spent Sunday evening in Donegal.
What does regionalisation involve?
Thank you, Mrs Bonino.
The debate is closed.
This has fatal consequences.
What does the grace period mean?
That may well be.
They will lose this argument.
You will abandon it!
The debate is closed.
These are thus two opposing principles.
We must seize this opportunity.
That is a fact of life.
The debate is closed.
I have the following comments to make.
This is not the case at present.
Otherwise it will fail.
The sense of that escapes me.
We need all of these systems.
It is not.
The debate is closed.
I find that very professional.
Let me make that quite clear.
Why were such tactics adopted?
We want a uniform opinion.
We all have to do that.
I have done it myself.
That is the first point.
Why?
No, we cannot agree.
I really think that you are mistaken.
Mr Whitehead, I am a doctor.
We shall not make any progress.
We certainly have no problem with that.
The same applies to Amendment No 17.
I consider that very unwise.

Year 2000 computer problem
Individual citizens own many products.
They use public utilities.
This is critically important to us.
Finally, on safety.
Transport is another.
I will focus on four points.
The second point is liability.
My third point is awareness.
I think that is most important.
We have no idea what will happen here.
I am very curious to know.
But we cannot be sure of that.
I think that would be money well spent.
Time is getting on.
A thought did occur to me.
Clearly this is an important issue.
They may be far-reaching.
The responsibility is a global one.
But we must look beyond this.
The result is reasonably good.
We have looked into this too.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 11 a.m.
These are important priorities.
We should welcome this.
That is sometimes overlooked.
Of course, we cannot accept that.
What is this issue all about?
Take the cancer list, for example.
So we must demand a total ban.
Thank you, Mr van den Broek.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Could this please be corrected?
I apologise for that.
Thank you.

Mr Fayot has the floor.
There is no need to take a vote.

That is no kind of a solution.
That is the first thing.

Is there a speaker for or against?
I have to be against, then.
Parliament rejected the request

Mainstreaming
Naturally, something has to be done.
It requires knowledge and information.
I have three points to make.
I include my own government in this.
Its record is rather poor.
That should give us food for thought.
That is the reality.
We must move closer towards parity.
So we are approaching parity here too.
I hope her questions will be answered.

Amendment of the Rules of Procedure
Does anyone wish to speak against?
That is not the case.
Parliament rejected the motion
They leave space and gaps to fill in.
The Rule changes do this.
I shall not go into all of them.
Thank you, Mr Guti√©rrez D√≠az.
The will is certainly there.
But that is not really my problem.
There are many examples of this.
Thank you, Mr Fayot.
Why do I say that?
They cannot be experts on everything.
They each lead complex coalitions.
It tabled only two amendments.
That is a grave mistake.
The thought behind that is obvious.
That is the point of a roll-call vote.
That is the result!
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Orphan medicinal products
The second issue is that of incentives.
That is the aim of Amendment No 40.
We should also learn from experience.
Personally I doubt it.
And that is perfectly understandable.
The problem is easy to describe.
The Member States would have to do so.
We have proposed two kinds of criteria.
We want to support research.
As I said, we are at first reading.
It did not work.
It concerns Amendment No 18.
I did not go into this matter directly.
I have already spoken against the fund.
After all, that is what always happens.
Thank you, Mr Bangemann.

Public health policy
How should that work be organised?
Firstly, it is time for bold thinking.
It is hard to explain.
So what should be done?
What, I ask myself, is premature?
This technology is available now.
I would like to see pilot projects.
Only then could I approve the report.

It is not efficient enough.
So there is a great deal to do here.
Sorry for not answering your question.

Bananas
That is its right.
Applause
So I ask you, where do we go from here?
And if so, what coin will that be?
That makes the situation even worse.
Why now?
It is a most puzzling matter.
Commissioner Brittan should know this.
I heard it on Friday.
I also have the shortbread biscuits.
I realise that is not the issue today.
The Caribbean producers do.
We too must adopt a Section 301.
And this is understandable.
So, let us take the gloves off.
No more softly, softly on Helms-Burton.
Let us have a WTO panel on that.

What is the aim?
We shall not only condemn them.
We all have our nemeses in due course.
On that basis, nemesis can be avoided.

That is the situation that exists.
Perhaps we could come to a compromise.
One speaker per group, Mr President.
Parliament approved the request
He said so in so many words.
It is not illegal.
There is no question about that.
We have heard that point before.
That is a very positive point.
What policies and at what level?
These questions cannot be avoided.
This is true of both VAT and GNP.
Thank you, Mr Martinez.
Question Time (Commission)
Thank you for your reply, Mrs Cresson.
Thank you very much.

That project was completed in 1997.
Thank you for the answer.
A misunderstanding has arisen.
I thought I was clear enough.
A visit to Managua should be made.
Naturally, the Managua delegation ...
The President cut the Commissioner off
It is as simple as that.
I am sorry, but that is the way it is.
Is a draft convention now available?
Mr Kinnock, you have the floor.
Thank you for your reply.
Thank you, Mr Kinnock.
That is our first obligation.
I will support your campaign.
I do not think it is a real question.
There is no question about it.
Thank you, Mr Mor√°n.
So I think that is enough for today!
Thank you, Mrs Gradin.
I cannot promise a result before April.
That has already happened.
Thank you, Sir Leon.
These are the rules.
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
The directive is more modest.
This has now been achieved.
This is the situation.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Their cooperation is much appreciated.
That concludes Question Time.
Own resources (continuation)
What are we really talking about here?
It has no legal basis whatsoever.
It is 25 years out of date.
This tells us a great deal.
I want to congratulate her on that.
That is fair enough!
So I am not in favour of rapid change!
It is definitely renationalisation.
My opinion is that it does not.
The report has nothing to say on this.
But it has no clear thrust.
Timing is important here.
Thank you, Mr Liikanen.

Ports and intermodal terminals
I would never go so far as to say that.
And we continue to support you.
We think that is wrong.
I think that is the crucial point.
Intermodality is a key factor.
So where does that leave us?
Are there three or four corridors?
That would be very good.
I understand that view very well.
He need have no worry about that.
Thank you, Mr Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
Railways
That is untenable!
I think that is the essential point.
Or is that really the case?
We should bear that in mind.
That is our goal.
Decisions need to be taken.
Nevertheless I endorse both reports.
Some simply refuse to do so.
I do not agree with him at all.
Why do we say that?
That is eight years ago.
We are happy with them.
That is a major misconception.
It has not been repaired for 30 years.
But I note that Mr Hyland has left.
But these are modest steps.
Why is this?
Firstly, there are the charging rules.
Consequently we cannot accept that.
The debate is closed.
It is time to put ferry safety first.
We will meet that commitment.

It will not save one ECU.
I think that is the challenge.
I hope he will do that.
We certainly do not.
Times have changed.

I was there to speak on urban policy.
We need to have partnership.
We do not want to be prescriptive.
This is a matter of the utmost urgency.
I ask you not to disappoint them.
How right he is!

The debate is closed.
This is true of Lithuania and Bulgaria.
We cannot tell them what they must do.
And there are reasons for this.
That is not new.
We have said as much previously.
I would be glad to hear your answer.
Question Time (Council)
There is a broad spectrum here.
Laughter
I do not deny that by any means.
What does he propose?
Mr Corbett, I will be very specific.
We know the answer very well.
We cannot fire the whole Commission.
Have I understood correctly?
But we see that as an ongoing process.
I could add many more to this list.
Thank you, Mrs Gonz√°lez.
There are no guarantees.
So there are no guarantees.
Then we could form an opinion.
Thank you, Mr President.
Is this of no concern to the Council?
These are generally legal experts.
I do not intend to do so either.
Who will?
I will say it once again.
Legally, they are completely different.
What am I supposed to say?
She has not asked me a question.
It is clear.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
Thank you for answering my question.
We are on the right track.
All of this is included in our policy.
However, I do not share your optimism.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
What projects, what problems?
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
That concludes this item.
Multiannual energy programmes
We will discuss these later.
What does that suggest?
I have not invented anything new!
We always agree.
That is not the problem.
If you include hydro, it is 6 %.
That really should have been included.
That is the crux of the matter.
So we need prefinancing.
Do something better than I proposed.
I would like to emphasise two points.
That is quite obvious!
Thank you, Mr Papoutsis.
The debate is closed.
Bank charges
I find this hard to believe.
Why?
So what is the difference?
But this process must be accelerated.
Thank you, Mr Monti.
This is unbelievable.
But none of this has happened!
The fact is, that has not happened.
I could not have put it better myself.
Not a bit of it!
If anything, charges have increased.
This is totally unacceptable.
Obviously not.
Thank you, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
Leaf tobacco
That surely should not be the answer.
We all understand that fact.
I say to them: sancta simplicitas .
This is not the way to go.
This is where the main obstacles lie.
This has not happened before.
5 % is no big deal.
In my country, it is taxed at 82 %.
Why?
We want an answer.
That was Mr Trakatellis's question.
I hope I have been clearer now.
Thank you, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
That is the heart of the problem.
The first one is short and simple.
Parliament must tackle this issue!
Thank you, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.

1999 Annual Economic Report
But we have not reached that stage yet.
Applause
EMU has not been a protection.
We need a coordinated response.
In fact we have gone backwards.
In particular we must:
This is clearly not enough.
In fact, these are also to be reduced.
They are too optimistic.
Why is all this happening?
Nothing new there, then.
This too is nothing new.
This is what we are seeing today.
It is as simple as that.
Applause
But that alone is not enough.
Yes, we should be concerned.
For that he has our approval.
Only time will tell.
What are we seeing now?
But what?
In that respect they are very critical.
We must set a good example here.
But they cannot be the only reason.
This helps to support world trade.
How can we sustain growth?


At no stage did I say otherwise.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
EU relations with Central Asia

It is one I have addressed before.

These concepts are to be avoided.

Monfils recommendation (A4-0106/99)

I cannot argue with that.

Belarus
That is the problem.
One of these is freedom of the press.

I will therefore begin with Cuba.
That is also dialogue.
I can reassure Mrs Lenz on this point.
The fifth issue relates to Belarus.

It is therefore to be welcomed.

Thank you, Mr Monti.

Yes, such a thing is possible!
Only then will we have peace.

It has been progress for democracy.
The problem is the culture of secrecy.
This is scandalous and undemocratic!
You know how difficult that is.
That is the only sensible way forward.
Our relationships will be realigned.
It has certainly not been easy.
They brought the problems to light.
This will have to be investigated.
We have a right to information.
What do we do now?
We need a new balance.
Secondly, we want action quickly.
I hope that is the case.
How can that be ensured?
This ambiguity needs clarification.
Thank you, Mr Brinkhorst.
Grasp that opportunity now!
That is not an option.
It will need to be a strong Commission.
There is no excuse for such behaviour.
These must also be our priorities.
This should be its chief concern.
That is totally unacceptable.
Mrs Cresson must go right away.
We agree with what Mr Cox said on that.
That schedule suits us perfectly.
This was not the case a few months ago.
Let us not try to re-write history.
It is up to us to tell them the truth.
That is a shameful admission.
The challenge is how we act upon that.
Decisions are difficult.
I do not think this is enough.
This issue can no longer be ducked.
One must not do what is inadvisable.
Let us hope so!
That really is a shame.
He has my vote.
Others have lessons to learn as well.
Can we live up to this culture?
Parliament too is facing a challenge.
We have to act responsibly.
But we all live and learn.
It is high time they did.
It will be a tough battle.
New blood is what is needed.
They are a common crew!
These alone, however, will not suffice.
Reform of the Commission is the start.
Thank you, Mrs Matikainen-Kallstr√∂m.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the joint debate on:
So this is a most serious debate.
I shall confine myself to three points.
Firstly, KEDO itself.
There was one problem.
I am no troublemaker.
It is totally isolated.
We advocate both these things.
Perhaps I can just quote them.
The Euratom Treaty is 40 years old.
It provides no powers to Parliament.
It has been a long, hard road.
We have a series of concerns.
It is being fitfully delivered.
All I ask is that we move quickly.
The situation is critical.
We should not miss an opportunity.
That is what the letter says.
We have to be realistic.
So much for the military aspect.
You may find that amusing, Sir Leon.
I find this totally incomprehensible.
Is that correct?
We are in a dilemma.
That is the logical thing to do.
Can you reply to that point?
He has spoken in a very clear way.
It has to be seen in that context.
Thank you, Sir Leon.
The joint debate is closed.
We have no idea.
Quite the opposite.
So there is work to be done here.
I trust it will be able to do so.
Let us hope that we can do so.
We shall certainly make that request.
The debate is closed.
Application of Community law
Community law lacks clarity.
Thank you, Sir Leon.
The debate is closed.
Common system of VAT (standard rate)
That is indeed a crucial requirement.
Why not under 15 %?
Thank you, Sir Leon.
The debate is closed.
The sitting was closed at 10.55 p.m.
Liability for defective products
That was a welcome development.
I criticise you for that.
So I will not say it.
Eight amendments is not very many.
Surely that cannot be what we want!
Nor could we accept it.
But I did not support her on it.
That is essential.
Some got it from growth hormones.
I think that is quite wrong.
That cannot be in our interest!
You referred to the definition.
I am convinced we must do so.
Thank you, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 3 p.m.
Global governance and UN reform
And what does quickly mean?
That can be easy enough.
There is no place here for vetoes.
Where is the UN?
When did the UN meet?
What has Kofi Annan said?
But where is Kofi Annan?
Why does he say nothing?
What, then, is the problem?
We shall have to be rather more bold.
Let us look for the causes.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 3 p.m.
This is our aim in terms of priorities.
There is a problem of management here.
Applause
Applause
The negotiations were tough.
That brings us on to Category 5.
So I would like to put him right.
This will be no exception.
What are the real needs?
I have two specific comments.
But is that the real reason?
It is asking for trouble.
It will mean transparency.
We cannot accept this.
I felt this should be said.
Thank you, Mr Bourlanges.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 3 p.m.
Police cooperation
It works.
It means something quite different.
All I can say is that he is right.
Then we can endorse the proposals.
Illegal immigration is a real problem.
Thank you, Mrs Gradin.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 3 p.m.
Leonardo da Vinci programme
I shall focus on the management of it.
Mrs Waddington made that point too.
What remains the same is the objective.
Why seven years for the programme?
Surely this is too long.
They are no longer appropriate.
We must put an end to that.
Happily that did not happen.
That was the problem here.
I do not think that is right.
I believe we should be mindful of this.
We cannot afford to.
We cannot allow just one TAO to remain.
It is one of our major tasks.
Thank you, Mr Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 3 p.m.

Friday: no changes

The next item is the joint debate on:
This is why we need Europol.
Applause
Things have to change.
It is time for us to get back to work.
That is what is disturbing about it.
It is nothing new.
I will start on a positive note.
I think that is a good thing.
There are some good examples of this.
It could not be any more complex.
We are ready to meet that challenge.
We need much greater cooperation.
Sentencing policy varies widely.
Mr Nassauer referred to Europol.
We will not tolerate anything less.
But they are not sufficient.
Two key objectives must be retained.
I refuse to accept this.
But why do young people use drugs?
How have we failed?
Yet it has still not been set up.
For these reasons we reject the report.
Where is all this leading?
That is a very bad idea.
That is largely what Europol is about.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
And that is where the shoe pinches.
Is this really necessary?
All this is a sorry state of affairs.
That is in itself a good decision.
But it should be the last paper.
What we need now is legislation.
Mrs d'Ancona has said this already.
Nothing has come of it.
This is the thin edge of the wedge.
I strongly oppose this proposal.
I admit there is no easy solution.
The report analyses four key problems.
Please consider this.
I refer to the reuniting of families.
Just hark at that!
Will the refugees become messages too?
Shame!
I appreciate her confidence.
I totally agree with that.
The rapporteur questions this approach.
I wholeheartedly agree with that.

That brings me to Mr Fantuzzi's report.

That is a success.
Of course this is also about marketing.
Unfortunately, good things cost money.
I have seen this happen!
Finally, garlic is a normal problem.
None of this was rectified in Berlin.
I see that you are not pleased.
That makes me very happy.
I am unhappy about that.
Every year the income drops.
That is the long-term challenge.
Our processors are being put at risk.
This is why there is high unemployment.
I challenge the Commission here today.
I turn now to the price package.

However, we are signatories to the WTO.
That would certainly be welcome.

Informing and consulting employees

There is some confusion here.
This is nothing more than that.
Unfortunately, it was not adopted.
That is why it is needed.
I thank you for your support.

Working time
So why exclude them further?
A few words now on doctors in training.
This is not an easy task.
We welcome those agreements.
This issue is very dear to our hearts.
I can only agree with Mr van Velzen.
But that is not all that is needed.
Basically, this is what has happened.
Two problems still remain.
Clearly the current answer is no.
This leads to problems in two areas.
The first is safety.
No one would disagree with that.
My second point concerns service.
Get out of that Mr Blair!
There can be no gaps here.
My final word is to Mr Crowley.
I thank you for your kind words.
I am grateful for your comments.
The joint debate is closed.
The next item is the joint debate on:
Congratulations, Mr Galeote Quecedo.
This is an important report.
The President cut the speaker off
I am against the two amendments.
That is why we also support this.
The first one relates to Togo.
This will now be possible in 1999.
That is your point as well.
But they were, in fact, well spent.
The joint debate is closed.
Pollution from large combustion plants
I do not understand it.
Yes, I did.
Why?
I recommend this proposal to the House.
One last comment.
It looks clean and healthy.
But the benefits would be incalculable.
That is an important step forward.
Hopefully it will be the first of many!
I understand that.
That is not a negligible amount.
In Germany, the rule is 200 mg/m3 .
People can live with that.
What will happen then?
That cannot be the intention!
We have discussed it several times.
The debate is closed.
Waste incineration
There must be a rule for this.
The old mixed formula was not too bad.
That is of course an enormous quantity.
I have two comments to make.
Lastly, I turn to the cement industry.
Finally, one thing is clear.
It will be resumed at 9 p.m.
Waste incineration (continuation)
This figure is simply too low.
You have serious dioxin emissions.
I would welcome that.
This is a matter of principle.
This is lunacy!
Europe can and should follow suit.
Thank you, Mrs Bjerregaard.
The debate is closed.
That is wrong.
Thank you, Mrs Bjerregaard.

We welcome that.
My feelings are slightly more mixed.
But this time things still went well.
Peace is an expensive asset.

I do not understand your language.
There is no point.
I do not understand it!
Applause
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office.
Heckling
It is not enough to talk!
Applause
I want to make that clear.
And it must be recorded in the Minutes!
It did not provoke Mr Milosevic.
That is not what we disagree on.
That is the way forward.
That was not the case a month ago.
This is the danger that we are facing.
We know that he is capable of anything.
He has proved this once again.
Applause
Kosovo is not Croatia.
So why this war against Serbia?
For the Kosovars?
Come on!
That does not give credit to our era.
The Serbs are the baddies.
The Serbs are wicked, all of them.
His crimes are crimes against humanity.
Applause
We must put them into practice.
He is considered to be a pacifist.
He has fired no shots.
The European Parliament must intervene.
Hand Rugova over to us.'
But let us be honest.
These questions are important.
Respect peace!
They have demonstrated that they can.
Get out of their way!
Everyone has made mistakes.
That did not work.
We did nothing at that time.
It is back.
Hopes for a united continent are dying.
There are many signs of this division.
What a defeat for us all!
What a regression!
The people will be the ones to decide.
There are other examples too.
War is never an end in itself.
Have we tried that?
Time is marching on: we must hurry!
That is quite incorrect.
Nelson Mandela negotiated for years.
I fully agree with Mr Soulier on this.
We endorse the NATO action on Kosovo.
So be it, then.
But that means troops.
The EU is not NATO.
Albania and Macedonia need help.
First of all, Milosevic is not Serbia.
The House observed a minute's silence
And fight not just in the air.
Rambouillet is dead.
I beg you to accelerate that process.
Europe should stop and think!
The bombing needs to be stopped.
This is a simple fact of life.
But there is more to it than that.
Applause
Or that we have forgotten all about it?
What is the point?
Yet another Rambouillet?
Applause
Thank you, Mrs Bonino.
The debate is closed.
Second bi-annual BSE follow-up report
But let us not panic!
That is of the utmost importance!
Thank you, Mr B√∂ge.
It remains to be seen!
But we do not know.
We will find out in the future.
It remains so.
This is a scandalous state of affairs.
Danger for one is danger for all.
I agree.
This, I feel, is extremely important.
There will continue to be a few cases.
So what can we learn from all this?
We now have an apparatus which works.
We should not forget this.
We cannot afford to be arrogant here.
Who will still protect the consumers?
I wish them the best of luck!
However, I welcome this report.
Commissioner Bonino now has the floor.
Many thanks, Mrs Bonino.
Question Time (Council)
They can issue new bonds in euros.
I have answered that question.
I have a supplementary question.
As you know, I come from Sweden.
Perhaps you can assist.
Thank you very much for that answer.
And it will continue to do so.
We have a few reasons to doubt this.
What is your influence?
We would really like to know.
After all, they are not state secrets.
I have already said that.
I have already done so.
This definition is unclear.
That is up to the Commission.
Is the Council aware of this situation?
What are the remaining obstacles?
It does not have the power to do so.
This a very sensitive issue.
Why all the secrecy?
Mr President, I should like an answer.
And we know the subject matter.
Thank you very much, Mr Verheugen.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
Thank you, Mr Ephremidis.
Well then, go ahead, let us have it!
I want to lodge a complaint.
Thank you for your understanding.

We are faced with a great challenge.
Applause
Thank you, Mrs Hulth√©n.
What more must they do?
What is Slovenia's position?
It is a difficult process.
We have to be honest and realistic.
My view is quite the opposite.
People care for the things they own.
I disagree with her analysis.
In any event, we are fully prepared.
This is a pace we want to sustain.
Finally, last but not least, Cyprus.
Mr President, I will end here.
The joint debate is closed.
Agreements and concerted practices
These then are the proposals.
But we also have certain objections.
What is the harm in that?
It will take some time to do this.
This concludes my reply.
It is not being responsible.
Mr President, I will be brief.
This is simply how I see it.
Thank you, Mrs Thyssen.
The debate is closed.
Thank you, Mr van den Broek.
The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.
Approval of the Minutes

You can decide.
Mr President, on a point of order.
It will be done, Mr Balfe.
I shall do as you request.
You are right that this is a problem.

No, that is not the case.
We reject that.

That is the best way to go about it.
But that is not true.
You should make a charge.
It will be resumed at 3 p.m.

Applause
Parliament agreed to this proposal
On Amendment No 7
It is very badly translated.

That must be added.
We really did forget that.
Loud applause
That was the agreement.
Applause

d'Aboville report (A4-0181/99)
Valverde L√≥pez report (A4-0139/99)
I merely wanted to put that on record.
Joint resolution on Kosovo
These issues have to be raised.
All human life is valuable.
Two wrongs do not make a right.
That is the issue.
Make of this what you will.
There is no legal justification for it.
And so this is ethical warfare.
It is not an isolated action.
That concludes voting time.
First, the principle.
I would not go as far as this.
This is quite unacceptable.
The debate is closed.
We have criticised this several times.
We rejected it here in Parliament.
It is not enough!
That is the position.
Now we have to find a solution.
We have to find a middle ground here.

The debate is closed.
Electronic money and its use
I thank the rapporteur.
I shall be supporting her report.

TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
That traffic is good business.
Safety has no price.
The figures are revealing.
We should have listened to them sooner.
Many victims would have been spared.
Nothing.
Now we are asking Switzerland to help.
We say, enough is enough!.
Switzerland has been mentioned.
They too lost colleagues in the fire.

Those are the road alternatives.

Schmidbauer report (A4-0111/99)

Thank you, Mrs Schmidbauer.
The Minutes were approved
Statement by the President
Applause
But the point surely is a moral one.
It is a disgrace and we should say so!
Thank you, Mr Kerr.
The matter is therefore settled.
Applause
I do not think they are.
Mr President, .
I think that is perfectly reasonable.
Why?
There is a clear contradiction.
What was the first vote on yesterday?
This matter is thus settled.
Thank you, Mrs Theato.
So how can there be a contradiction?
There is no contradiction.
Thank you.

Venice is a part of man's heritage.

Agenda
Wednesday:
We gain nothing by delay.
Nothing new will come out.
It is not a blank cheque.
Parliament rejected the request
So I have a problem.
We have a problem.
Those are the facts.
Thank you very much, Mr Wijsenbeek.
Applause
Thank you, Mr Ford.
The debate is closed.
Immunity is not a privilege.
Thank you, Mrs Palacio.
The debate is closed.
Annex V of the Rules of Procedure
That was the main problem!
That has now happened.
Thank you, Mr Liikanen.
Madam President, please excuse me.
I shall submit an explanation of vote.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
What do these reforms involve?
This would be wrong.


Let us take the example of the euro.
No!
Basically, he failed.
Well, you could say that.
They must not dodge this issue.
The Employment Pact ...
The President cut the speaker off
And it will be.
Why?
No, that is not on.
It increased by 1.1 % in 1998.
I shall not go back over this.
Here again I ask the question.
In my view, there is no contradiction.
The joint debate is closed.
Fraud Investigation Office
I now turn to the proposal itself.
It uses the term supervisory committee.
We have achieved a really good result.
We cannot wait for that.
But that is far from enough.
We have a huge task here.
That is what we need.
However, there is another snag here.
The debate is closed.
Discharge
I understand that particular problem.
We should close it down today.
I used to be one myself.
It is not, I am afraid, the Council.
It granted discharges.
I should like to thank all colleagues.
This is not possible.
We should go beyond that.
The Annex basically has three purposes.
That is an important point in itself.
Let me clear up one misunderstanding.
We were swamped with the usual stories.
Everything was in chaos.
I would like to commend Mr Liikanen.
It was possible to talk to him.
That is unacceptable.
We will simply not put up with it.
The committee supported me.
That cannot be allowed to go on.
This is going to be cleared up now.
We do not want to hear such stories.
This is a real scandal.
You have never applied the brakes.
I wish them well in their new building.
I wish it all the best.
I shall begin with discharge 1996.
Six reports are on the agenda.
Our Rules of Procedure were awry.
It has resigned.
But that is not how it has turned out.
We all know what has happened.
We owe this to everyone.
It is clear that nothing has been done.
However, we cannot close the accounts.

I now turn to the House itself.
Thank you, Mrs Theato.
It is available from the Commission.
They are based on joint opinions.
That part has been most open.
That is excluded.
Much remains to be done.
Both sides found it very useful.
Mr Dell'Alba was the rapporteur.
Discussion continues.
That is extremely important.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Mr Elles has a brief comment.
I will talk to him about the issue.
The debate is closed.
List of legislative proposals pending
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Dispute between the EU and the USA
What will the upshot of that be?
Thank you Mr President.
Let us consider where we stand today.
Is it a legal issue?
Has it not been proven?
Let us just consider where we are.
We have six hormones.
I would love to know.
Which data would that be, Sir Leon?
Go on, why not?
Now just tell me one thing, Sir Leon.
If so, whom in the European Union?
Madam President, I will do my best.
That of course we can do.
Let me now turn to hormones.
The answer is no!
It has not happened yet.
The debate is closed.
The proposal has a long history.
Just think what may happen.
It is just a small part of the answer.
Supply and demand can be matched here.
That makes no sense these days.
I really cannot see any sense in that.
Some of them are very important.
That is no mean number!
Why didn't we do it before?
Mrs Peijs encouraged me to be flexible.
Thank you, Mr Monti.
Thank you, Mrs Thyssen.
Thank you, Mr Monti.
The debate is closed.
The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
The Moluccans urgently need help.
This is really not normal practice.
Perhaps this can be added.
We shall check that and put it right.
I would like an answer here.
Applause
So no Council text exists.
The technical error will be corrected.
The text will be checked.
The Minutes were approved
Decision on urgent procedure
Thank you, Mr Colino.
Mr Mulder has the floor.
Thank you, Mr Mulder.
Parliament agreed to urgent procedure
I give the floor to Mr Prodi.
The people of Europe expect this of us.

This is important.
That is essential.
It is a failure of the Council.
Actions speak louder than words.
Applause
We are poised at a historic crossroads.
We shall hold you to all of that.
Privileges can be phased out.
I do not wish to dwell on this.
This also applies to the Balkans.
We wish you every success.
This is where Europe has failed.
We will hold you to that.
And just look at our Europe.
Parliament told it so and it resigned.
That was the revolution in mid-March.
This can be regarded as progress.
European democracy is moving forward.
That we expect of you.
That gives me some experience.
Do not forget your left wing.
Clarity has always been an issue.
That is not true!
Obviously this is a gradual process.
That is my plan.
I shall not speak about defence.
Let that be clear!
Our task here is increasingly enormous.
Applause
Thank you, Mr Prodi.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
Mr Imbeni did not give you the floor.
VOTES
Parliament adopted the decision
We shall look at it again.
Parliament adopted the resolution

Read report (A4-0205/99)
Wijsenbeek report (A4-0210/99)
Fayot report (A4-0216/99)
But that can be discussed.
Thyssen report (A4-0207/99)
Very well, that will be noted.
This is not true.
Menrad report (A4-0239/99)
That is a bad idea.
Wages are not a European concern.
Elles report (A4-0196/99)

I cannot call that into question.
Brinkhorst report (A4-0201/99)
So this amendment was rejected.
Fabra Vall√©s report (A4-0199/99)
Kellett-Bowman report (A4-0163/99)
That concludes voting time.
Situation in Kosovo
That is absolutely certain.
The second is economic development.
In our view Serbia is part of it.
It is ultimately about war and peace.
Applause
Many issues remain open.
This is absolutely vital.
Applause
Mr President, on a point of order.
The third point concerns the refugees.
Our reply must be: 'Europe is peace!'.
The President cut the speaker off
I find this truly regrettable.
What other alternative is there?
Let us deprive him of that hope!
It is a paper tiger.
Milosevic is playing for time.
But we must do it.
It is a black hole.
We all have good advice.
That is a complete disgrace.
That, I think, is quite unacceptable.
We have to choose one way or the other.
We are clearly being brainwashed.
It has to stop now.
We must be absolutely clear on that.
We must not let Milosevic win.
We have made that mistake in the past.
So it is time to start listening to us.
This war is aggressive and illegal.
Follow it!
Stop this dirty war!
The outflow of refugees is continuing.
Dictators fall sooner or later.
Tomorrow we celebrate the liberation.
So what else can we do?
What needs to be done?
We must recognise this.



What interests me is 'how'.
Mrs Gr√∂ner spoke of this earlier.
Let me begin with you, Mr Rocard.
The second issue is that of Montenegro.
Applause
Applause
Applause
He would like that.
And why?
Applause
Think of Bosnia!
Are our memories so short?
What must it take?
Applause
The cause is Milosevic's policy.
He is not a nationalist but a cynic.
His aim is to obtain power.
Applause
I have no doubts on this score.
Belgrade must take this on board.
Milosevic must take this step.
Applause
Thank you, Mr President-in-Office.
The debate is closed.
CFSP
The next item is the joint debate on:
Europe is a power in the world.
I would like to emphasise four points.
Clearly we must change.
My compliments and good wishes.
There are still more Slavs in Russia.
But it must not be used as an alibi.
Again Kosovo is evidence of this.
Nor are ground troops, as we know.
We do not take it seriously.
That is the core issue.
I am thinking of the Barcelona process.
I think we are all agreed on one thing.
Clear progress has been achieved here.
I will leave it there, Mr President.
The joint debate is closed.
Statute for MEPs
By a qualified majority!
That is ridiculous.
When are they to take place?
They will never take place!
This is nonsense.
We really are clutching at straws here.
There will be no Statute this week.
It is as simple as that.
So why not?
Applause
Why?
You know my group.
Those exist, it is true.
That means giving and taking.
My group is willing to do that.
But they did not do so.
The other 14 pages are different.
I consider this to be very balanced.
Applause
It is now or never.
That does not bear thinking about.
Now try to be a bit constructive!
And now we have reached this point.
How can we escape from this impasse?
Time is pressing.
So I think we must not be naive here.
There too, there were two systems.
A solution has to be reached now.
This issue has been taken into account.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Statement by the President
Perhaps you could advise me what to do.
So please tell me what I should do.
So please do make it!
That is our true political capital.
I want a Members' statute.
We could do that.
I therefore fully support this idea.
We will also have a new Commission.
Thank you, Mrs Laurila.
The debate is closed.
So I will be brief.
But our resources are already limited.
The same applies to Category 5.
Thank you for that comment, Mr Samland.
The debate is closed.
Charging of heavy goods vehicles
That is the first legal error!
That cannot be right!
I would not be so presumptuous.
I can understand that.
Even this proposal can be improved.
We have always done that.
The debate is closed.
The vote is scheduled for tomorrow.
Let us consider the proposal.
We accept that.
I shall refer to three amendments.
Otherwise it is useless.
I will not elaborate in detail.
The debate is closed.
So I am very pleased with this.
My last words should be to Mrs Kuhn.
This is a very good consumers' report.
The debate is closed.
Civil protection
The debate is closed.
Pollution by agricultural tractors
I would ask you to support this report.
Parliament has tabled five amendments.
Amendment No 4 is also unacceptable.
The debate is closed.
It has not been an easy time.
I would point this out to Mrs Breyer.
The debate is closed.
New codecision procedure
Now we have that for most legislation.
That is very important.
Thank you, Commissioner.
It has been much appreciated.
The debate is closed.
The sitting was closed at 11.44 p.m.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mr Valdivielso.
That is why we refused to host it.
The Minutes were approved
Our third aim was to launch the euro.
But it is not enough.
Applause
Thank you very much.
Loud applause
You also embody these same principles.
Fortunately this is no longer the case.
We remain true to the ideal.
Applause
I thank you personally for that.
Applause
May your future go well.
Applause
This does not always happen.
We are now an adult Parliament.
And I am happy to do so.
Heckling
I have not gained weight!
That is a misinterpretation.
Laughter
We have gained in political weight.
Muchas gracias, Se√±or Presidente !
Applause
That is important.
This was essential.
I hope that we get there.
I thank you for it.
You put tremendous effort into it.
Thank you, Mr Duhamel.
So there is still some way to go.
The next item is the joint debate on:
I now come to the matter in hand.
That is the lesson of the 20th century.
Let me say a few words on these points.
Thank you for your attention.
Applause
Applause from certain quarters
Should we go further?
Certainly.
We know all that.
That is the point!
Why?
Thank you, Mr De Giovanni.
I just wanted to verify that point.
Yes, that has been decided.
Let me make a final remark.
The second issue is the method.
I have read, listened and reflected.
However, I do not share this belief.
We are in the best position to help.
So I want to concentrate on two points.
I know the will is there.
That is a most important point!
We urgently need it.
And that is also the view of my group.
Applause
This is what we hope to see.
No end justifies the means.
The ultima ratio has proved irrational.
Cologne could be a historic summit.
Strategies must be agreed.
Finally that has been understood.
The response must be loud and clear.
There is an opening at the moment.
The debate is closed.
Agenda 2000
That is equivalent to the 1999 value.
You know all that.
Thank you for your attention!

Thank you very much.

Rothley report (A4-0267/99)
I thank Mrs Green for that explanation.
I thank her for clarifying it.
It will be wellnigh impossible.
I very much regretted that.
We have to look for change.
Today was a prime opportunity.
That is the thin edge of the wedge.
That is why I had to vote against him.
There is a difference between the two.
That is what is at issue here.
A parliament represents the people.
I share that view.

We have achieved major results.
However, the price is very high.
But that is not a reform!
But what will happen in the future?
No, no, no and no.
This gives rise to great concern.
We supported a safety net proposal.
This we believe was a success.
It was not our fault.
It is now time to look at enlargement.
Europe is able to act!
On the contrary!
I thank them warmly.
That is still lacking.
Overall this is a good start.
Applause
This was bound to be the case.
Is this possible?
Little remains of those criteria.
What exactly does this mean?
Why?
We will see how things turn out.
My report focused on this aspect.
Parliament has no political leeway.
Let me make my position clear.
Applause
Applause
'Yes'.
Laughter
I am looking to great things!
Laughter
That would be a new kind of magic.
Thank you, Mr Escol√°.
Question Time (Council)
You know the rules here.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
Mr Morris, please, just a moment.
No.
I cannot predict them today.
But you can imagine what they would be.
I cannot go any further than that.
You know the rules of Question Time.
Mrs Jensen, I am rather at a loss.
Thank you, Mr von Habsburg.
There are no further restrictions.
That is what I just explained to you.
Mrs Sandb√¶k, we have a problem here.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
The European Union has lost.
It did not manage to win through here.
I really cannot predict that today.
That is what the Council has done!
I take no pleasure in raising this.
There are a number of others.
You could work in cooperation with him.
The same applies to the presidency.
The situation is not what you think.
I am a little confused, Mr President.
Are we talking about Mr van Buitenen?
Is that the question?
That is the Commission's own business.
But that is not the case.
And indeed you can easily do so.
The Council cannot make any comment.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
Yet I do have a supplementary.
Thank you, Mr Verheugen.
We give him our best wishes.
That concludes Question Time.
Agenda 2000 (continuation)
My answer is a straightforward 'Yes'.
This is completely unacceptable.
I do not think so!
This too should be acknowledged.
I very much welcome them both.
That brings me to the Structural Funds.
Apparently there are compromises.
So what will we do then?
And that is the third problem: funding.
We are aware of this problem.
The share of VAT is falling.
We need other resources.
We are winding down regional policy.
How will I be able to stop them?
I feel terrible about this.
But we in Parliament had it reinstated.
We succeeded there.
I hope I will be back.
We do not have a list system.
Nevertheless, our intentions are clear.
Wishes still remain to be fulfilled.
It comes from our own President.
However, this alone is not sufficient.
A quotation from the past!
The Council retains its powers.




So there were two too many.
We can now see the results of this.
Applause
They do not come from these areas.
Heckling
Soft criteria are only 50 %.
This is not everything.
We must be fair and admit this.
Applause
I am content with that.
You have been a good President.
I had every sympathy.
The debate is closed.
That we have found unacceptable.
It worked.
But it is very unusual.
We will not want to delegate.
That safeguard is very important.
But this was far from the case.
But this was far from the case.
The debate is closed.
Fixed-term contracts
That would be the result.
I think these are the principal points.
That rankles, Mr President.
We have seen it during this debate.
The Commission welcomes the agreement.
How could they turn their backs on it?
The debate is closed.
All this has now been made easier.
Applause
We are distributing garlands tonight.
You have been a 'stayer'.
I thank you very much for that.
The debate is closed.
EC-Mexico Partnership Agreement
We need to talk about those issues.
There is no clear monitoring mechanism.
It is just about this and nothing else.
The debate is closed.
The sitting was closed at 0.35 a.m.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
I actually voted in favour.
We asked to go to Pristina.
We have noted that, Mr Sarlis.
He will then take a decision, as I say.
That is all.
The Minutes were approved
Schengen
The negotiations on this have begun.
This too is to be welcomed.
You are quite right.
This is no way to approach such issues.
No.
Again, no.
This is an absurdity.
We both grew up on free movement.
That was not the case.
Who is to supervise it?
Thank you, Mr Schapper.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Legal aspects of electronic trading
This is a very important area.
Electronic commerce is a growth area.
But there are some snags.
I feel this is important.
I do not want it banned totally.
I want the opt-out.
This makes common sense.
We should vote down that amendment.
I am sorry that it has come to this.
These things have to be borne in mind.
I am very unhappy about that.
Fine.
It also jams up the networks.
The opt-out does not work.
There is one in the United States.
It has proved to be unworkable.
I disagree with Ms Oddy.
We must be able to put a stop to this.
The same should go for the Internet.
There is a contradiction here.
The President cut the speaker off
I am very sorry.


Let us continue along this road!
The debate is closed.
That will not be possible.
I do not think that this is the case.
Mr President, on a point of order.
VOTES
The answer is the same as before.
Does the rapporteur agree?
Very well.
That is correct, what Mr Samland said.
The Commission agrees.
May I ask you to confirm that?
Thank you very much, Mr Samland.
I cannot confirm what you are saying.
I will not go into political criteria.
We have already seen that this week.
Applause
It is void, and you must withdraw it.
Applause
We must vote by qualified majority.
Loud applause
I am terribly sorry.
You were in favour.
Mr Samland is against, I think.
I move that we proceed to the vote.
We are in the process of negotiating.
Murmurs of dissent
We are going to vote, Mr Elles.
You have no knowledge of them.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That is an unacceptable error of law.
Laughter
Parliament agreed to this proposal
This is in yesterday's Minutes.
So the problem has been solved.
We shall proceed to the vote.
We must not allow advertisers ...
The President cut the speaker off
Mr Watson, that is not correct.
We are not having a debate now.
Parliament rejected the request
We shall thus move on to the vote.
Parliament adopted the decision
I welcome this.






I voted for the report.
Colom i Naval report (A4-0230/99)
Could you confirm this for me?

Oddy report (A4-0248/99)
I share their view.
Aglietta report (A4-0169/99)
Resolution on Kosovo
Mr President, I voted against.
That is a bad start.
Applause
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Thank you very much, Mr Newens.
I have my doubts.
We must not lower our guard.
Thank you very much, Mr Mendes Bota.
It is indeed a police force.
But how will this happen?
Thank you, Mr Mar√≠n.
It is a supplementary question.
Laughter
I do not mind.
Be careful.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Applause
This was not to be.
Applause
So what happened?
Thank you, Mr Mar√≠n.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Death penalty
Applause
Thank you, Mrs Lenz.
Parts of me stayed in prison.
It hurts.
No.
Kurdish question
What about them?
When will they finally be released?
Thank you and goodbye.
That is all I wished to say.
Applause
Malaysia

International Criminal Court
We should set an example here.
Thank you, Mr Mar√≠n.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
I think that is all that need be said.
Thank you, Mr Mar√≠n.
Thank you for that clarification.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
That is well known.
That is quite a different matter!
How simple, I wonder!
So when and where will it be stored?
Heckling
I will be brief, Mr President.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be taken in a moment.
Applause
That was indeed a fine piece of work.
Thank you once again for all your work.
Congratulations and well done.
The debate is closed.
Make of it what you will!
However, this is only the first step.
I am just a servant of this House.
I merely follow the agenda.
The debate is closed.
Insolvency practices
Applause
We have to conclude the debate.
The debate is closed.
Many thanks for all your work!
Applause
This is an extremely sensitive area.
The two must be clearly distinguished.
Applause
That has actually been changed.
That is what is going on here.
Let me give you an example.
Madam President, on a point of order.
I did not mention his name.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The sitting was closed at 7 p.m.
Thank you very much.

Thank you, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
Madam President, on a point of order.

Madam President, on a point of order.

He took up his position in February.
Thank you, Mrs van Bladel.

He has not done so.
Thank you, Mrs Lulling.

Madam President, on a point of order.
I am fascinated by this!
You are right, Mr Hallam.

I find this a satisfactory solution.
Thank you, Mrs Gradin.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Hannover 2000
We know the outcome.
Applause

Thank you, Mr von Habsburg.
Applause
Lessons should be learnt from this.
Thank you, Mrs Gradin.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Parliament adopted the resolution
European textiles market
Thank you very much, Mrs Ferrer.
It would then take appropriate action.
Thank you, Mrs Gradin.
This approach needs to be changed.
Let me tell you one.
Applause
Thank you, Mr R√ºbig.
The debate is closed.
Parliament adopted the resolution
Applause
Thank you very much indeed and goodbye.

Thank you - moltes gr√†cies .

Thank you and good luck for the future.
But we knew what we meant.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr Bertens.

Thank you, Mrs Gr√∂ner.
Are there any comments?
Mr Posselt has the floor.
Thank you very much, Mr Posselt.
That will be noted in the Minutes.
The Minutes were approved

There has been a troika visit to Burma.

This is a new process.
Thank you for your attention.
Loud Applause

Such action was necessary and just.
Applause
Applause
Applause
There is no doubt of that.
Applause
Applause
Talk serves no purpose whatsoever.
Applause
Applause
This has been a difficult Presidency.
Applause
Our group rejects this nomination.
Applause
Applause
We shall just have to wait and see.
Institutional progress? Wrong!
We cannot talk in terms of success.
Applause
I would like to highlight two of them.
We are still not there.
I refer to the reform of institutions.
I will go further.
Take note of what we do.
This is the only chance of success.
Applause
It is quite obvious that there are.
Should we have sat back?
Applause
We should not forget this.
Applause
All the best!
Applause
Thank you, President Fischer.
Applause
Democracy must first be restored there.
Applause
That is our aim.
As regards this demand, we must also...
The President cut the speaker off
It is illegal.
I do not consider that a secret ballot.
Applause
Your comment is noted.
That is progress and we welcome it.
Applause
Loud applause
Applause, heckling
This team has a weak point.
Applause, heckling
I consider it unacceptable.
Loud applause
Applause
Applause
Applause
There is no prejudice.
Applause, heckling
Applause
Loud applause
Applause
This must be done as soon as possible.
How could we explain such a thing?
We are playing here a European league.
You have begun to take steps.
You have announced reforms.
Applause
Applause
Applause
Applause
Applause
Applause
This will be important to us.
Our hearings also will be fair.
Applause
That is the message of my group today.
We will give it.
Applause
I therefore greet your team positively.
Applause
Applause
Applause
Applause
It is pathetic, Mr President Prodi.
How much confidence can we show in you?
Applause
Applause from the left
Applause
Applause
Applause
Firstly, the situation in Kosovo.
You have mentioned some of them today.
Applause
I will make three very brief points.
Applause
Applause
Applause
Firstly, the Wise Men's report.
There you are.
Applause
Applause
Programme of the Finnish Presidency
Aid must go to where it is most needed.
Applause
Applause
This is not in the spirit of Monnet.
Applause
Applause
Applause
Applause
Thank you, Mr Fischler.
It is exactly what we need.
I don't believe it is.
Applause
The Union has to change direction.
But at what price?
Now just a word for Serbia's benefit.
Let us at last learn from our mistakes.
Applause
You need it and we need it.
It depends particularly on you.
Applause
What on earth is that all about?
It simply won't do.
It must be amended.
Applause
My country, Germany, didn't want him.
He was not permitted to be in Greece.
Now he is in Turkey.
We are prudent and we are sensible.
That is what is important.
I am dumbfounded, Mr Commissioner!
Firstly, in relation to Yugoslavia.
Are we ready for that?
That inevitably means external trade.
But what if Milosevic does not go?
That is no solution.
Applause
Applause
Peace needs to be rebuilt there.
That is welcome.
It is important.
It is not a forgettable minority.
The President cut the speaker off
The debate is closed.
Position of Mr Bangemann
We need precise rules.
It is always in the same kind of vein.
This is what worries us.
This should also be borne in mind.
Remember the business with the yacht.
This is also relevant here.
Applause
The stakes are high, dear colleagues.
There is more.
This case is interesting.
That was all I wanted to say.
Applause
Thank you.
That was almost entirely avoided.
We enjoy a very considerable privilege.
The debate is closed.
The sitting was closed at 9.10 p.m.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
The Minutes were approved
Dioxin
Now to the reason itself.
A final word on the tests.
Applause
Perhaps this is a translation problem.
Applause
Applause
That is a fair few.
Applause
He assured me that it was not.
Applause
So let's get down to business.
So what lessons can be drawn from this?
Mr Fischler mentioned some of these.
Waste products have no part here.
So please let's have a dioxin register.
Applause
They are victims and they suffer.
We must have European regulations.
We have seen a number of examples.
We are turning our cows into cannibals.
But that is not all.
Quantity takes precedence over quality.
We must change tack.
And the crisis is not yet over.
We must be honest.
The question is how?
The vote will take place at 12.00 p.m.

All parties are still suffering.
What can be done?
We must all play the game.
Who will be able to do this?
I very much doubt it.
Finally, I wish Finland every success.
What will be next on the list?
However, such a view would be wrong.
The President cut the speaker off
I can see at least three.
This has repercussions for the market.
Applause
This is far too few.
Applause
What is the issue here?
That cannot be the plan.
Last point: Hormone meat.
Just so you know!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12.00 p.m.
Of course.
Absolutely.
A small matter, Madam President.
A small matter, but please resolve it.
Applause
We shall have this corrected as well.
Yes, Mr Staes.
Applause
I have taken note of your request.
VOTE
That is a good question.
Applause
(Loud applause)
Is it a vote by roll call or not?
May we have a vote by roll call?
Applause
This resolution has just been rejected.
That is how it stands.
Do you agree?
These are:
Who could think otherwise?
Kosovo
There is, therefore, no time to lose.
Death sentence on Mr √ñ√ßalan
Contamination by dioxin
That concludes voting time.
The sitting was closed at 1.05 p.m.
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
I would like to make that point.
This has been noted.
Applause
Applause
We shall be attending to this.
That is on the agenda for this morning.
Applause
The Minutes were approved
French Football Federation fine
The point is well made and well taken.
The organisers were the CFO.
We intend to keep it that way.
That is the silver lining.
It is not taking it seriously now.
We are talking about big business here.
This is simply not acceptable at all.
It must do something to stop it.
Sport is now big business.
The tribunal there found in our favour.
Applause
It is an absolute scandal.
Applause
Applause
And yet, this breach is taken lightly.
I begin with Mr Perry.
Let us be rational.
I can understand the sentiment.
Football came home, it was said.
Come on.
Let us be rational.
The absolute opposite is taking place.
This is the point.
There was no knowledge of the rules.
Thank you, Mr Commissioner.
Adjournment of the session
The sitting was closed at 9.55 a.m.
Resumption of the session
(Loud applause)
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mr Posselt.
I take note of your request.
The message has been received.
This is the procedure.
Order of business
The next item is the order of business.
There have been exceptions.
And sometimes, a negative burden.
Why is this?
Some require practical changes.
We are at a decisive juncture.
We believe that much can be done.
This is certainly not the case.
This will be a difficult matter.
I know that this is a delicate area.
I now come back to my original point.
A few general comments on contracts.
I believe that is quite right.
I will cite just two examples.
What truth is there to this?
It is all too late though.
Is that so?
For this diagnosis is an edifying one.
Why was it not improved?
It is quite unacceptable.
What does the Wise Men' s report say?
It seemed to be the overall solution.
A little self-criticism then!
(The President cut the speaker off)
.
The past ruled, conventions paralysed.
That recognition is very encouraging.
That must change - and it will change.
Will they now be adhered to?
Now the next step must be taken.
They are underpinned by a vision.
But various things must first be done.
Quite different approaches are needed.
The talk must be of democracy.
A new Financial Regulation.
Excellent.
There are problems with wages.
And these are just a few examples.
Perhaps this was pressure?
Distribution of power?
I shall pick out four points.
That is the way it has been written.
The plot is outlined in this report.
.
But thank you just now.
Accidental marine pollution
.
In any case, why is she not here?
The debate is closed.
Environmental inspections
.
A recommendation is grossly inadequate.
How can this best be achieved?
.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.52 p.m.)
However, we still have one problem.
That would be quite in order.
We are perfectly capable of doing so.
That would seem logical.
So, I turn to the House.
Perfectly clear and simple.
Statement by Mr Prodi
Our vote is not a blank cheque.
No.
Concrete measures are needed.
It must not remain a mere catchphrase.
And we have received it.
And there' s the rub.
Where is the problem then?
We offer you our co-operation.
Secondly, reform of the institutions.
That, for us, is the deciding factor.
A last word about the hearings.
They were positive.
We wish you good luck with your work.
We are delighted to hear it.
Very well.
I cannot recommend a "yes" vote.
Not all candidates see it like this.
We are a Europe in the making.
But we want to go further.
We fundamentally disagree with this.
You mentioned Ukraine.
This is not personal.
It is not political.
It is a point of principle.
We are not anti-European Commission.
You have even spoken of religions.
So much for European democracy.
There is openness but nothing else.
This is a step in the right direction.
How could we possibly not approve?
And what do these include, Mr Prodi?
So, can we be hopeful?
That is four or five in all now.
And that is after BSE and dioxin!
You say you have learned lessons.
The debate will resume after the vote.
Approval of the Minutes
You have all had time to look at them.
Are there any comments?
That will certainly be done.
That is all.
Absolutely, Mr Pannella.
Are there any other comments?
In your kind response, you said:
(The Minutes were adopted)
Statement by Mr Prodi (continued)
(The interpretation was adopted)
Everyone has said that this morning.
We want from you concrete objectives.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Thank you.
This is praiseworthy stuff.
We hope she will be heard fairly there.
I should like to mention three.
That is an urgent priority.
I wish you luck.
It is anyone' s guess as to why.
Statement by Mr Prodi (continued)
I shall emphasise two points.
It is politically unacceptable.
Is that what we are asking for?
We are giving confused signals.
We must learn from our hearings.
We have no choice, Mr Prodi.
I hope you agree with that.
I wish you all well.
I would argue in favour of this.
Please observe the Rules .
We must work together.
We are delighted about this.
Our world is not millennium-proof.
This is a matter for great regret.
Let me come to the substance.
The social dialogue is very important.
Congratulations.
But I believe that we must go further.
We want to see action soon.
Make haste, Mr Prodi.
Why am I going to vote unwillingly?
Budget for 2000
Now, it is quite simple.
The opposition is these people here!
Let us now get down to the budget.
That is one thing we cannot do.
It will not go away.
That money has to be paid for sometime.
That will be our position, I am sure.
Yes, we want a solution.
But this is not our role.
We found category 1 disappointing.
It must fulfil these responsibilities.
I support this idea fully.
Thank you, Minister.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 5.53 p.m.)
Tribute
Approval of the Minutes
Are there any comments?
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mr Rack.
I see that Mrs Stenzel agrees.
We will amend this.
(The Minutes were approved)
It may also be feasible to use it now.
And what, then, should it be based on?
These must be equally balanced.
In this way, we safeguard our future.
This would increase legal security.
This is essential.
We need permanent solutions here.
I speak of electronic surveillance.
There is certainly a need for this.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Welcome
I wish you a warm welcome.
(Applause)
Let us move in this direction then.
The proposed document draws on it.
It must have a balanced agenda.
Experience so far is not so good.
Welcome
I find that scandalous!
Why should this be?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Situation in East Timor
We all feared unrest.
Tyranny has prevailed in the area.
Votes
I totally agree.
Let me add a further comment on this.
These codes are not unchangeable.
Unfortunately this was not the case.
(Applause)
Our Group does have a group position.
Voter influence is being limited again.
This is hardly dignified.
We cannot accept this.
Today the battle commences.
Ladies and gentlemen, I will not obey.
Look at your groups!
Parliament must stop being like this!
(Loud applause)
But neither have we wanted to say no.
This is not the case in this instance.
Mila esker
What new employment policy?
Democratic procedure
The political content
.
Nor is it a vote of confidence.
.
That is why I abstained from the vote.
.
For our part, we condemn it resolutely.
What, in fact is Mr Prodi asking for?
Are we dreaming here?
This is a record.
Therefore, congratulations.
Thank you very much, Mr Fabra.
I am grateful for your opening words.
The support for NGOs is on the decline.
We do not believe that to be fair.
Kosovo is a special case.
I could not do this, of course.
The debate is closed.
Situation in East Timor (continued)
I saw all this with my own eyes.
Why should there be mass graves?
This was completely unequivocal.
As we stated in our motion...
(The President cut the speaker off)
And this is the time to act.
This has been said several times here.
Mass terror everywhere else.
It is clear what action must be taken.
The UN must intervene under Chapter 7.
The militia must be disarmed.
But let us look inwards as well.
Let us look at ourselves.
It should not have.
But what form should this support take?
There is no civil war in Timor.
This has actually happened now.
It is completely unacceptable.
It has to stop.
The disaster was not unexpected.
This is, of course, far too long.
Let us not try and kid ourselves.
Perhaps this now rests with the army.
Capabilities are limited.
That is my first comment.
Mr President, this is a timely debate.
It is two weeks too late.
They are too late.
They too are too late.
What is wrong with us?
I am surprised that she was surprised.
I welcome the peacekeeping force.
But it must be delivered quickly.
I accept the need for the ban on arms.
We failed to protect them.

We in Britain had that opportunity.
We are never there when it counts.
Why?
Why is it always too little, too late?
We failed, and failed miserably.
What is wrong?
Others have taken up our cudgels.
He is not here today.
He will assume office tomorrow.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Thank you very much, Mr Portas.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
No, we do not conclude that.
I will go further.
I hope that it is a procedural motion.
Question No 2 by (H-0407/99/rev. 1):
Thank you for your answer.
I think the questioner is quite right.
Question No 3 by (H-0408/99):
Thank you. That is a good answer.
Question No 4 by (H-0409/99):
Or are they still to be secret?
They will be passed in total secrecy.
Question No 5 by (H-0414/99):
Question No 6 by (H-0416/99):
I suspected something like this.
Question No 7 by (H-0418/99):
Mr Sasi has the floor.
Question No 8 by (H-0420/99):
Question No 10 by (H-0424/99):

However, he has told us nothing new.

It is probably a linguistic issue.
Nobody is perfect, as you know.
Question No 13 by (H-0436/99):
Question No 14 by (H-0437/99):
Question No 15 by (H-0438/99):
It must take action on North Korea.

Thank you very much Mrs Maes.
Are there any comments?
Thank you very much, Mr Galeote.
(The Minutes were approved)
Neil, Commission.
We have five main concerns.
Firstly, the location.
Either you are on-site or you are not.
Secondly, its length of stay.
This is of real concern to us.
But the worst is still to come.
I should like to make four points.
(Applause)
This must not happen.
They are there all the time.
Their leaders are there all the time.
They are ready to take over.
But what are these projects?
This policy is catastrophic.
A commendable initiative.
I will end on a lighter note.
Other speakers also stated the same.
How did that vacuum come about?
What is this vacuum?
And how do you intend to fill it?
Just in Kosovo?
Not in the surrounding areas?
I admire you!
And yet, you have not batted an eyelid.
That is the reality.
But we have some time.
The rapporteur is right.
We must be more careful.
Thank you, Mr Sakellariou.
.
Thank you, Mr Kinnock.
What are we achieving?
What do we see?
The Council' s benches are empty.
I think this would benefit democracy.
I am sure others share your view.
Neil, Commission.
Thank you very much, Mr Kinnock.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 p.m.
10th EC-UNRWA Convention (1999-2001)
I should like to raise a few points.
One of these options is this report.
The EU can contribute a lot here.
Progress on this issue is now urgent.
Thank you, Vice-President Kinnock.
Please be very brief.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 p.m.
Votes
Welcome
(Loud applause)
Votes (continued)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That is different to a split vote.
, rapporteur.
That is an important political point.
(The President cut the speaker off)
That is what we shall support.
.
McKenna report (A4-3/99):
Jackson report (A5-2/99):
That concludes the vote.
Financial crisis in Russia
There is nothing new about it.
The answer lies within Russia itself.
Thank you to the Commissioner.
Topical and Urgent Debate
Earthquakes in Turkey and Greece
It will be a long and laborious path.
That is the only possibility.
That is an outrageous lie!
.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Dagestan
Russia has enough problems as it is.
No one is anticipating that either.
So what is happening?
But there was no follow up action.
, Neil, Commission.
With that, the debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Human rights
The resolution goes into this as well.
No agreements were drawn up about this.
Unfortunately we cannot compel them.
Let us ponder that for a moment.
We must now correct this mistake.
Burma
Iran
Unquote.
Togo
The situation there is grave.
The situation in Togo is not new.
.
I very much welcome that.
That pressure will be maintained.
I now move to the issue of Togo.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
Lusaka peace agreements
We must be vigilant in this matter.
.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mr Sakellariou.
My criticism of him was perhaps unfair.
(The Minutes were approved)
State of the Louise Weiss building
The bridges are there.
The cameras are waiting there.
I request that the volume be lowered.
Madam President, it is the same point.
Indeed that is what we intend to do.
Thank you, Mrs Lambert.
This week this building has worked.
I hope we all bear that point in mind.
But I am not here to offer praise.
The building is fine.
People like me.
I am just 1.60 m tall.
I' m just not tall enough.
I need assistance.
That' s just crazy.
There is no newspaper stand nearby.
I wanted to get out on the tenth floor.
It wasn' t on.
Five times that has happened to me.
Can you imagine it, in a single room?
The present situation is unbearable!
All this will be dealt with.
Thank you, Mr Fabra Vall√©s.
But I digress.
I have no doubts on that score.
I shall be in touch with you.
Mr Priestley will inform you of this.
I was told it would be too expensive.
Strasbourg is indeed a beautiful city.
Thank you Mrs Ludford.
That is worth repeating.
I propose ...
Can you make the point please?
When problems arise they get solved.
That would help us all.
Thank you Mrs van der Laan.
So I cannot do my work properly.
I had serious asthma attacks here.
I support it completely.
There is a danger of falling.
We should keep to the principles.
The architects specified slate.
Thank you Mr van Dam.
Personally, I like these colours a lot.
Well, I don' t like pink!
A few thoughts, now, on the lifts.
I find it regrettable.
Thank you very much.
Firstly, the offices.
I hope not but time will tell.
That surely is the key point.
We ought to get that sorted out.
I would like to mention three points.
Firstly, services.
Now they come much later.
The times we work are well known.
Please give this further consideration.
It is inadequate.
I request that this be put to an end.
These things are just unacceptable.
Please look into this once more.
But that does not seem to be happening.
We have a time problem.
I hope they can get that right.
My name was already on the list.
I particularly wanted to speak too.
I shall send you a comment in writing.
We have well overrun the time.
Perhaps we need to do it again.
Adjournment of the session
poor working conditions for chauffeurs
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
Are there any comments?
Thank you, Mrs Maes.
(The Minutes were adopted)
Thank you, Mr Speroni.
Agenda
The next item is the order of business.
Relating to Tuesday President.
They have abided by the rules.
At long last the beef ban was lifted.
We need an urgent statement and debate.
I hope time can be made for this.
That is not the case.
I would happily run such a debate!
I have no problem with that.
I could do it.
(The President cut the speaker off)
No, we cannot do this.
(Parliament rejected the request)
(Parliament rejected the request)
Relating to Thursday: President.
(Parliament gave its assent)
That can hardly be a crime!
That is why I voted for that motion.
Thank you, Mr MacCormick.
Thank you very much.
We can all notice it.
It will be here tomorrow.
(The sitting was closed at 5.35 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
Are there any further comments?
(The Minutes were adopted)
Decision on urgent procedure
That is nonsense.
Public health and food safety
It was very good.
You have made it clear.
Have you understood this?
I hope so, Mr Prodi.
What ought this White Paper to contain?
It must be very ambitious, Mr Prodi.
This is a shortcoming.
This must be improved.
It must be made transparent.
This must be changed.
We do not have any of this.
The two cannot be separated.
The one is crucial to the other.
You need to change this.
Is that what we have then Mr Prodi?
That is what I want.
I want transparency at a high level.
Thank you for your attention.
What do we want to eat?
How can we guarantee this quality?
We should have the courage to say so.
But this has to happen quickly.
If they are not fresh, they rot.
It is an either/or situation.
Everybody looked at everybody else.
It is a disgusting procedure.
Europe can surely do better than that.
That is my first important point.
We also need clear rules and bans.
May I say one more thing.
(The President cut the speaker off)
I hope you understand.
This is scandalous.
We must search our own hearts.
Waste matter must be treated as such.
For goodness sake!
Suspicions on that score are rife.
I support that as well.
This must be changed.
There is no place for anonymity.
Then I would have no more customers.
That must be our maxim!
This legislation must be amended.
They have no new scientific evidence.
They closed their eyes to it.
Britain is vigilant now.
This has many unpleasant consequences.
What is being done on that score?
My third point relates to supervision.
An excellent idea.
Would Brussels be informed?
Do you have an opinion on this?
How safe is our food?
Who can guarantee its safety?
Who keeps watch over these matters?
Free trade. A Europe of citizens.
That is the farmers' capital.
So feedingstuffs have to be cheap.
Nowhere else!
We must be in agreement about this.
We want to cooperate in what we do.
Hence this debate.
These things do not go together.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
Hiding the facts will do no good.
What can we do to help?
That is a good thing.
Do more and do it better.
Children are affected above all.
However, AIDS is no inevitable fate.
The disease knows no boundaries.
This must cease.
Too high.
Our aid budget is considerable.
Solutions do exist.
There must be compassion.
I only want to highlight three aspects.
This is a dreadful situation.
Survival is also a human right.
In fact, it cannot be deduced.
Those are my comments.
Thank you again for this debate.
Thank you, Commissioner Nielson.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
What are they about?
Is that what we mean by stability?
It has happened in the past.
Firstly 1999 and then 2000.
As Mrs Rothe said, 12% is not enough.
It is totally unacceptable.
It is not acceptable.
The problem is one of resources.
12%, as Mrs Rothe said, is not enough.
One needs only to look at Denmark.
That is to be welcomed.
However, there is also a second aspect.
Perhaps we need a little more time.
It is therefore totally acceptable.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
SAVE multiannual programme (1998-2002)
I totally disagree with this.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Let me now summarise the essentials:
There will be adjustment costs.
At times, it has seemed interminable.
We thank Mrs Kinnock for her efforts.
I welcome this initiative.
This is absurd.
Good agreements make good friends.
I am confident that they will succeed.
I will give some examples.
I can reassure you on that point.
So, this is also on track.
The debate is closed.
How do you view this?
Thank you, Mr Prodi.
I have seen it in people' s reactions.
This is what I wanted.
Question Time (Commission)
First part
Question No 28 by (H-0465/99):
Question No 29 by (H-0470/99):
We must make a choice.
So do not talk to us about neutrality!
Europe is not neutral in this matter.
Europe must choose.
Yes, but you are not getting one.
I ask that this fact be respected.
Nor can I be persuaded to.
Question No 30 by (H-0489/99):
I would just like to ask two questions.
We shall do that through the programme.
Question No 31 by (H-0498/99):
Sixthly: hygiene.
Question No 32 by (H-0514/99):
Second part
That report has been published.
That is the first question.
That is not the situation here.
This is an important issue.
As you say, both issues are important.
>Questions to Mrs Reding
Question No 33 by (H-0463/99):
There is no cost to the user.
Moreover, we also have the Europa site.
Question No 34 by (H-0469/99):
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
It is unfair!
Can they do it easily technically?
Question No 40 by (H-0494/99):
That I am determined to do.
I accept what the Member said.
Question No 41 by (H-0496/99):
Question No 42 by (H-0516/99):
. Absolutely!
Question No 44 by (H-0543/99):
Question No 48 by (H-0467/99):
There are various procedural motions.
Question No 49 by (H-0479/99):

So I am unable to give an answer.
This is to our common advantage.
But we should look to the future.
How shall we then answer that charge?
I find that lamentable.
What has changed within Turkey?
That is the crux of the matter.
He is right.
Nothing further need be said!
I think he made it perfectly clear!
Was this a bad thing for Slovakia?
We had no response.
It is time for us to deepen the Union.
Turkey has shown no signs of this.
The EU is not a Christian club.
Take us or leave us" .
So well done!
How can we do this?
We cannot put this off any longer.
What was he referring to?
If only that were true.
Kurdish identity must be recognised!
There must be no doublespeak!
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
Let me remind you of these four points.
Nothing has changed since then.
It is up to them to change.
These are key issues.
We said yes to Customs Union.
So what exactly is new in Helsinki?
There is no getting around these facts.
That is the reality!
But we cannot yet integrate Turkey too.
We should dismiss this thought.
Now we have this opportunity.
All the speakers have wished for this.
Now is the time for truth!
A last word on the cultural aspect.
I do not dispute that.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 12 noon.
Middle East peace process
Much has changed since the last spring.
Welcome, Commissioner.
.
I commend this motion to Parliament.
The issue has stalled there.
Everyone is entitled to a homeland!
Finally, the matter of the refugees.
There is more work to do.
Thank you, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.

VOTES
Amendment No 5 is fully acceptable.
Thank you, Commissioner Patten.
Relating to Amendment 5
That is quite clear then.
In fact, the vote is under way.

I have always had confidence in this.
Opening of the Millennium Round
We are living in a historic age.
Thank you very much, Mr Sasi.
Welcome
I think you are right.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
(The President cut the speaker off)
(The President cut the speaker off)
So much for internal policies.
Financial viability comes first.
But what about the human beings?
What about thought?
What about nature?
What about solidarity?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Let us not allow this to happen again.
Look around.
(T he President cut the speaker off)
Firstly, a general remark.
It is a pity that Mr Pasqua has gone.
Has humanity gained anything from them?
Yet, there has been no catastrophe.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Why?
That is very good news.
We must have a balanced package.
That matters to the public too.
We have to do it.
(The President cut the speaker off)
What do we need to do in terms of form?
So what then do we really need?
Since then things have changed.
We must also adopt a coherent position.
I do not call this protectionism.
I am also thinking of education.
Secondly, telecommunications.
My third point is TRIPs.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy.
The debate is closed.
Climate change
The political challenge is enormous.
It is going to cost them money.
The first is about emissions trading.
The third point concerns aviation fuel.
What initiatives do you have under way?
It is to take place in Bonn.
We oppose paragraph 16.
They are right.
That is what I want.
That is a major cause for concern.
We should turn our attention to it.
That is what is intended.
That is the big worry.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.

TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
Chechnya
This is what we should avoid this time.
We must put a stop to this.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
European Code on arms exports
Three obvious things come to mind.
We have to address that.
That is the urgency.
The Code has now existed for one year.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Human rights
Moratorium on the death penalty
Why am I saying this, Mr President?
Today the threat is serious.
It is urgent.
Moluccan Islands
What needs to happen?
Help is also needed to rebuild those.
This gives me great cause for concern.
Belarus
What we see is quite the reverse.
A climate of fear is being created.
But the situation is unimaginably poor.
Thank you, Mrs Schroedter.
Democracy is a gift to us all.
An old communist system lives on there.
Her speech of thanks tells us a lot.
The situation of the Roma in Kosovo
There is no need for me to read it out.
Thank you very much.
It is pro-human.
A renewal is under consideration.
This took place on 24 September.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Aviation accident at Ustica
(The President cut the speaker off)
Why the urgency?
Why this urgency though?
So what happened?
Why was all this done?
Transparency is therefore an issue.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
Nuclear accident in Japan
There will be an investigation.
That costs money but it has to be done.
Any weak link is dangerous.
We shall therefore abstain in the vote.
That, of course, is our position.
This is what happened in Tokaimura.
We cannot trust individuals.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The facts tell us otherwise.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place in a moment.
President.

(Loud applause)
Thank you, Mrs Flemming.
Thank you, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel.
We shall see when this can be done.
I thought it had been.
We all know them very well.
That is perfectly acceptable.
There is food for thought here.
I am also reminded of a past event.
We pressed for changes.
This situation must be reversed.
Let us make good use of it.
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.
The debate is closed.
Electronic signatures
Look at the appendices for example.
I am very pleased by this development.
I commend this legislation.
This is good news.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
Motor vehicles and trailers
That is the first objective.
That is the second point.
These relate to the question of safety.
Why is that?
It is because of diesel spillage.
I congratulate him on that.
There is a revival in motorcycling.
I do not know why.
The debate is closed.
The debate is closed.
Passenger cableway installations
We have to be concerned about safety.
I commend this report to you.
The debate is closed.
Are there any comments?
Thank you very much, Mr Howitt.
(The Minutes were approved)
EC and ECSC budgets for 2000
This distinction is patently absurd.
The same applies to payments.
I think this is a serious point.
Parliament says no.
It is not acceptable.
No, we cannot get out of it that way.
It is just not possible.
This is the situation as we see it.
I should warn you on this point.
It would be a serious matter.
There are essentially two of these.
We are respecting this agreement.
(Applause)
There are two advantages to this.
That would be a dubious policy.
A brief word on agriculture.
We want Africa to pay for the Balkans.
Some cuts are even worse.
That has not been done.
We hope he will soon be back with us.
We have less than we wanted on B3-4003.
We think that is an excellent outcome.
That would be catastrophic.
The debate was tense and lively.
Firstly: structural operations.
The third matter is obviously Morocco.
I do not just mean financial support.
We are facing major challenges.
Momentum will be lost.
Even there we manage to get it wrong.
I will finish by telling you a story.
(The President cut the speaker off)
What was the preliminary draft?
That is nothing but bookkeeping!

The onus is on you.
Then we can have various debates.
I would like to see that.
That is not the case.
These, in brief, are the focal points.
(The President cut the speaker off)
We managed an ordinary majority.
It is Category 4.
Firstly, Category 1: agriculture.
It simply cannot be done.
We must pay this money.
I think that is precisely our point.
How can we still justify this?
Where is it all going to end?
Parliament wants to go further.
The Virrankoski report does that.
That is the Commission' s figure.
We are also responsible for this.
A lot has been said about Kosovo.
Well, that is all very well.
First we bomb, then we rebuild.
And then there is even East Timor.
"What thinkest thou, Simon?
Peter saith unto him, Of strangers.
We need both things.
The priorities are clear.
Well done Commissioner!
I hope the Council can do the same.
I hope that is understood.
I am in favour of aid for Kosovo.
What is the situation?
Very cunning.
These tasks go hand in hand.
That is my first point.
That is when it all started.
Mr President, this is my first budget.
I welcome this.
The SMEs account for 66% of jobs.
Many thanks, Mr R√ºbig.
, rapporteur.
The debate is closed.
Thank you for bearing with me.
ECB annual report


This should continue to be the case.
What is the nature of this problem?
This brings me to my second comment.
(The President cut the speaker off.)
Why not?
The essential complement ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Why?
There is no basis for this.
It is not!
Success according to what criteria?
Is this success?
Very well.
But I want a clear answer today.
What is the main objection?
.
First of all the issue of transparency.
What does transparency mean?
I do not yet know the precise form.
Those forecasts are not published.
That is our strategy.
It is forward-looking.
There is a difference.
We all want to go forward.
Then it would be possible.
The ECB will be there.
Thank you very much, Mr Duisenberg.
The debate is closed.
And, finally, the conclusions.
Could you clarify this?
It sounds easy but it is not that easy.
.
We will come back to that.
Somewhere we have to find a balance.
No, to the first part of the question.
The debate is closed.
Annex - Formal sitting
(Loud applause)
(Loud applause)

"Is there a civil war in Colombia?"
"What does the "zone of peace mean?"
In Colombia, there is no civil war.
It is not a military plan.
Thank you very much.
(Sustained Applause)
We have clearly heard your message.
(Loud applause)
But the Union must also reform.
The first is asylum.
The second is immigration.
This is positive.
This must now change quickly.
This is now urgent.
And what about freedom?
It is an important step.
We need more light!
(The President cut the speaker off)
Like disease, crime knows no borders.
Both are absolute disasters.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Not one death more.
Yet the situation is urgent.
What do our German friends think?
The direction is the correct one.
The people of Europe expect more.
Parliament must help them.
This must be monitored closely.
This is a matter of processes.
The debate is overrunning somewhat.
I hand the floor to Mr Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 p.m.
Report on the IGC
The first objective has been achieved.
The debate has been initiated.
We do not think so.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We must address wider issues.
Change is necessary for the Court.
If it does not, we will all lose.
And what did we find?
What must it do?
What must it mean?
Think of Slovenia, think of Estonia.
How far is Europe going to go?
How far, in terms of geography?
How far do we want to go?
With what partners and by what route?
The debate is closed.
Votes
Frankly, this is intolerable!
(Applause)
Mr President, on a point of order.
This is a printing error.
Does the Commission wish to comment?
Thank you.
President.
Would the Commissioner like to comment?
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
This was extremely important to me.
So, a comment will be made.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTES
Pack Report (A5-0013/1999)
Huhne report (A5-0035/1999)
That is the reasoning behind my vote.
This is absurd.
The number of votes cast was 525.
The absolute majority is 263 votes.
The votes cast were as follows:
Mr Anastassopoulos: 256 votes
Mr S√∂derman: 269 votes
(Loud applause)
Restructuring of firms
The first is that of the Observatory.
My next point concerns social dialogue.
That is sometimes forgotten.
This was also evident from the figures.
The Commissioner said the same.
That is what Europe needs.
But what can we do?
We need to revisit that.
Thank you very much, Mr Hughes.
(The President cut the speaker off)
You will understand this.
Today, we should tell it like it is.
This has been predominantly successful.
That is very much a fact of life.
However, that is not enough.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Everyone must gain some advantage.
Finally, research too.
Can the European Union intervene?
The debate is closed.
Nuclear testing
It is what we all want.
We are friends of the United States.
It is well deserved.
What a sad prospect for our century!
They do not have it now.
He called this irresponsible.
That was not enough.
We know that.
Therefore, we must do a lot more.
Her judgement can be appealed.
An important step forwards.
That is the stupidity of this.
One rather more serious point.
I totally agree with him on that issue.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
EC-Russia summit in Helsinki
You have the floor, Mr Sasi.
So much for the good news.
Now for the bad news.
That is frustrating.
Aid organisations cannot work there.
We need a political solution.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Finland is now an independent country.
Why not?
I am looking for a way out.
That is not how Tacis works.
Thank you, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
Culture 2000 programme
That is a wonderful catchword.
Firstly I must highlight funding.
Firstly, the cultural networks.
Languages are more than mere words.
This is what we should opt for.
Thank you, Mrs Reding.
The debate is closed.
Youth programme

The possibilities are there, use them.
I want more to benefit, not fewer.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
This is an important step forward.
I have indeed just confirmed this.
Young people are our present.
They are building their future.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
European Audiovisual Observatory
Turning now to the Observatory.
This requires objectives and efforts.
His work was thorough and fast.
Thank you, President Gargani.
Parliament thus has complete control.
The debate is closed.
I do not share that attitude.
That does not come automatically.
Thank you, Commissioner Reding.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.10 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
(Applause from the left)
I am quite sure of this.
The test should be very simple.
That was the unanimous decision.
(Loud applause from the right)
Very well.
That is quite clear.
We understand your point.
Mr Bar√≥n Crespo, you are quite right.
I checked with the Sessional Services.
So, things should be quite clear.
(The Minutes were adopted)
Could you please clarify this point?
We must be clear on this point.
Absolutely.
You can rely on me.
We are unaware of any other problem.
(Applause from the Greens/EFA Group)
Votes
Relating to Amendment No 460
Relating to Chapter B1-400 President.
(Loud applause)
Yes, that is correct, Mrs Staes.
Relating to Amendment No 65
The Council still has to approve this.
We therefore withdraw our amendment.
Thank you, Mr Bourlanges.
I see that he will.
Relating to Amendment No 430
We already have a problem.
We have now gone above the margin.
Relating to Amendment No 394
Following the vote on Amendment No 443
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Loud applause)
This is worth clarifying.
The request is completely unexpected.
We have rejected.
That is perfectly in order.
But Mr Corbett has a very strong point.
(Loud applause)
There are no objections?
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Mr President, I spoke yesterday.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)

Napolitano report (A5-0036/1999)
Thirdly, for political reasons.
It puts us in an intolerable position.
They supported this in committee.
Thank you.
Restructuring of firms
- (FR) Ridicule never killed anyone.
, in writing.
Nuclear tests
Transport of dangerous goods by rail
This is done without any supervision.
The dangerous liquid poured out.
We have been lucky.
There is no doubt about it.
I have my doubts in this regard.
It has been accepted and is understood.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
EC-Morocco fisheries agreement
When?
How?
What kind of agreement, Commissioner?
What kind of cooperation?
This is not acceptable.
The summary report is now available.
It is fanning false hopes.
We must respect their rights.
Europe needs Morocco and vice-versa.
This is not only an economic problem.
First point: joint enterprises.
What does this mean?
This would mean cutting jobs.
This time the same thing will happen.
It is a Community debate.
Fishing policy is a Community policy.
Because how will this pan out?
What input will Parliament have?

This is a challenge to Parliament.
It is playing for time.
This is not the essence of the problem.
Here too, no time is to be lost.
(Applause)
The sitting is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 5.45 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
The EDD requested voting by roll call.
I shall give you an answer.
There is a golden rule in Parliament.
We never go back on a vote.
In my opinion, this is not right.
I would like to see this minuted.
I remember perfectly well.
(The Minutes were approved)
I take note of his words.
Thank you Mr Berthu.
Votes
Poli Bortone (UEN), in writing.
British beef and veal
This cull continues for new BSE cases.
This meeting is still going on.
This is the reason for my argument.
That is very important.
This is unacceptable.
Let me conclude on one final point.
British beef is safe.
No cases at all.
That has disgusted everyone.
It is important to remember that.
I hope France will see sense.
An Agency is sensible and appropriate.
But this is not the same thing.
Would they?
This is completely untrue!
The laws of biology apply to everyone.
That was a very commendable thing.
These are basic principles.
Allegedly!
I will give you one such example.
And for why?
I want to salute the speech she made.
It will damage the single market.
The basic problem is animal feed.
The solution is a national one.
Thank you, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
EC-Angola fisheries agreement
We should therefore use this time.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Explanation of vote
Thank you, Mr Posselt.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 a.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
Are there any comments?
Forty MEPs voted on important matters.
Thank you, Mr Vander Taelen.
Thank you, Mrs Isler B√©guin.
You were quite right to do so.
(The Minutes were approved)
Agenda
The next item is the agenda.
(Parliament gave its assent)
A second problem now arises.
This is for various reasons.
Fair enough, I had to accept that.
(Applause from the PPE group)
I believe they are unrelated.
(Parliament rejected the proposal)
British beef and veal
It is not a setback.
It does not need to be changed.
It is not a negotiation.
That remains my view.
Not a lot astonishes me nowadays.
They are post-mortem tests.
Tests are being undertaken as we speak.
I welcome her statement in that regard.
They got that information also.
It is not their function to do so.
I regard this as a good way forward.
How are they chosen?
How independent are they?
There may be other meetings next week.
It may all happen earlier.
If it does, so much the better.
It seems ludicrous.
What exactly are they asking for?
(Applause from the PPE group)
Thank you, Mr Byrne.
Madam President.
(Heckling by Mr Martinez)
Oh, just shut your trap!
So work is proceeding on this issue.
Thank you for addressing us so clearly.
There is no more scientific evidence.
(Applause from the PPE group)
That is what I am trying to do.
That is what I am trying to achieve.
And why was that?
Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.
This item on the agenda is now closed.
Macroeconomic dialogue
It is thus a new process.
The time will be used for discussions.
We need both.
Naturally, we have acted accordingly.

It is no substitute for policies.
The Union is a rather closed entity.
Who is going to be represented?
Let us just admit it!
The States?
The Commission?
The European Union?
Then there are the social partners.
Just one more point.
They are there to advise and influence.
Some have used the word secrecy.
That is a retrograde step.
I fully share their opinion.
I shall stop now.
We need political guidelines.
But come now!
It is called a macroeconomic dialogue.
The macroeconomic dialogue is critical.
We see this as a first step.
There is no sign of that yet!
It is, however, an innovation.
We have full participation.
Nothing has been tabled so far.
This is more than adequate.
Actually, I have a proposal.
Mr Pronk is absolutely right.
Amendment No 7 relates to sea fishing.
That needs to be reviewed.
It should have taken immediate effect.
This is an extremely important sector.
Doctors have our lives in their hands.
I am not taking out anything in that.
I ask for your support.
That is not asking too much.
I urge you to support Amendment No 10.
I do not know why that is the case.
It is just not acceptable.
This is naturally unacceptable.
Yet it is fraught with problems.
Paid work is still seen as a commodity.
Four years is a more reasonable period.
The jury is out.
It is appalling at the moment.
In conclusion, thank you.
Clearly there is some misunderstanding.
I take note.
The second issue concerns Sunday rest.
Could the speaker please repeat it?


Obviously, this is of great concern.
I am not prepared to break our rules.
The debate is closed.
I do not believe that works.
Let us carry on with China.
, rapporteur.
That is quite clear.
That is precisely what we are doing.
Thank you very much, Mr Gahrton.
The debate is closed.
It must be of mutual benefit.
This was not the case.
We can only guess why.
We cannot, of course, ignore Chechnya.
Thank you, Commissioner Busquin.
The debate is closed.
0.5% of GDP is spent on research.
EUR 18 million is not a lot!
We benefit from it too.
Thank you, Commissioner Busquin.
The debate is closed.
Information on fuel economy in new cars
How will we do this?
The Council went along with this.
Again, the Council agreed.
The directive is a mere starting point.
We now have to gather experience.
How does one define these classes?
We should not be deterred by this.
So what am I driving at here?
Great!
We certainly have not.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
European internal market
Why is there any confusion?
It is not only that.
It is something that goes much further.
Now for our wishes.
The action programme is now behind us.
What we need next is a strategy.
This work is on-going.
There will always be new decisions.
Admittedly, the deadlines are short.
Secondly, simplification.
I would like to emphasise this point.
Thank you for your time.
Neither are we!
Maybe it should be e-lex.
We have challenging times ahead.
Enforcement is the priority.
The Commission is very grateful.
The internal market is a reality.
I could not agree more.
I agree, in principle, with Mrs Peijs.
I agree with Mrs Peijs on that score.
I could not agree more.
The Commission should react to this.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.05 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Employment
That is really not on!
That is how I see the European model.
So far, the results have been meagre.
It was hard work.
I think my group is entitled to this.
I would like to point a few things out.
This process is to be respected.
Not one is on public investment.
We have to deal with the figures.
And this should remain so.
Statement by the President
The answer is no.
Employment (continued)
Let me mention a few such areas.
The answer is no.
We are really far short of the target.
This is in itself worth noting.
We never believed this.
It is not a fact.
It hardly had any impact at all.

Benchmarking has been mentioned.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place shortly.
Votes
I now come to my second point.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Absolutely.
I hope this will not prove necessary.
This is a second reading.
Very well.
Is there a speaker against?
(Applause)
Thank you, Commissioner.
I am in favour of flexible working.
Relating to Amendment No 13
This applies to the German version.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Take Belgium.
That is why we need a better climate.
(The President cut the speaker off)
But they were not accepted.
Internal Market (B5-0204/1999)
Thank you.
That concludes the agenda.
Adjournment of the session
(The sitting was closed at 12.20 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Statement by the President
It is a tragedy.
Agenda
This is not the way to do business.
No.
(Parliament agreed to the amendment)
President.
That is my proposal.
How do things stand on timing?
Could you comment on this, please?
That worked brilliantly.
Thank you, Mr Leinen.
(Parliament gave its assent)
I think this is a reasonable request.
What is your position on this?
Mr Posselt is quite right there.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Relating to Thursday:
Firstly, the case of Alexander Nikitin.
Thank you, Mrs Hautala.
(Parliament gave its assent)
(Parliament rejected the request)
That is clearly wrong.
Why?
We need to add something here.
It really costs nothing.
It is just a question of attitudes.
I am rather hesitant about one section.
Will there be a hold-up?
By and large, I am very pleased...
(The President cut the speaker off)
.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Daphne Programme 2000-2003
One does not have to look far.
They feel ashamed.
Great!
Let me take Austria as an example.

Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Rights of the Child
This will clearly take a little time.
Please take some action!
Mrs Gr√∂ner mentioned child soldiers.
Babies have nothing but their rights.
They can have no obligations.
Six million have been maimed for life.
Treaties on their own do not suffice.
They also need to be implemented.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Informing and consulting workers
Mr Ghilardotti described the facts.
I did not entirely follow you.
But we have some good news now.
This directive will ensure that.
It is crucial that we let it be heard.
One day we will have to go further.
We have made some progress.
It is a majority proposal.
Please bear that in mind.
We need to get this moving once again.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 8.15 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
A similar problem.
Thank you very much, Mr Tajani.
System of own resources
We would like to change this.
This is not acceptable.
It is therefore unsustainable.
This is a fundamental issue.
And that is what they want to hide.
That is where the injustice lies.
Who must pay?
What are the bases for payment?
Proportionality, progressive increase?
We may well hesitate.
It is absurd!
The situation is completely surreal.
What must be paid?
Finally, who decides who must pay?
So this argument is not important all.
Let me make one further point on this.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Budgetary discipline

Today SAB 5 is also being debated.
We are in the middle of November.
That is our problem.
That is no way to behave!
As rapporteur, I would like to know.
Which list is that?
The list of eleven or a list of four?
Mr B√∂sch explained it in great detail.
That is not how it works!
Mr President, I congratulate you.
The debate is closed.
Environment and Community energy policy
Mr President, thank you very much.
It is a good report.
This situation must change!
But this is not the only contradiction.
This is precisely the problem.
All this requires money.
Nuclear power is not the solution.
This will be required.
The debate is closed.
Vote
De Palacio, Commission.
President.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
They were greatly encouraged by them.

It is more than time for this.
Report by Mr Chichester (A5-0060/1999)
I fully share this point of view.
That concludes the vote.
I hope you will bear with me.
Judicial cooperation
Here we need a simple procedure.
This is indeed urgently necessary.

My group can therefore back the report.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
That is the conundrum that faces us.
What have we done previously?

In vain it would seem!
That does not come into it.
Here we have a different lever.
It really is a dreadful dilemma.
Let me be very clear.
That is still my intention.
That is an important issue.
It was discussed in Florence.
We hope not.
, Commission.
May I put it to you straight.
He is only doing his job.
That is what I have done.
It is the first step.
No further time has been given.
Where is there more doubt than here?
So that is my question.
You raised the question of Article 36.
Thank you very much, Mr McMillan-Scott.
The case for such a directive is clear.
Question Time (Commission)
Part I
Question No 42 by (H-0634/99):
This is clearly not enough.
No, Mr President.
This is not the time.
Question No 43 by (H-0650/99):
This aid will cost EUR 8.5 million.
Question No 44 by (H-0608/99):
However, that is by the by.
But it is only for questions.
I would be grateful for your comments.
Question No 45 by (H-0619/99):
This is my answer.
Or would you withdraw this?
I am glad to answer that question.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I am just wondering about that.
You have 15 seconds, Commissioner.
I must fulfil my obligations.
Question No 47 by (H-0628/99):
That is not true.
Question No 48 by (H-0631/99):
This Convention is dated 1983.
We have had the Tampere Summit.
People have already waited long enough.
Question No 50 by (H-0606/99):
How can we achieve this?
I think that is extremely important.
Question No 51 by (H-0613/99):
Questions to Mr Verheugen
And yet the problem persists.
Thank you, Mrs De Palacio.
I ask for the Members' forgiveness.
Question No 56 by (H-0625/99):
Question No 57 by (H-0627/99):
Thank you for your detailed answer.
But of course.
The answer is a definite yes.
That is what it is all about!
Question No 58 by (H-0638/99):
Good, then I am satisfied.
It sounded otherwise.
I did not mean to suggest anything.
Are there any comments?
I was welcoming Mr Solana.
You see, Mr Solana, what a welcome!

(The Minutes were approved)
Yes, of course.
Statement by Mr Solana
This will be my main priority.
We need to be in a position to act.
This is obvious.
I am coming to the end.
Of course we have no military role.
Here we come to a crucial point.
Only 15% were civilians.
We can also see that in East Timor.
It is a big job.
I want to make one final point.
We must not remain silent!
(Applause)
I wish you luck.
This is for us a core challenge.
It is an ambitious, difficult task.
We wish you well.
Foreign policy must also be open.
Keep the two operations together.
They have to be kept together.
I welcome Mr CFSP' s taking office.
But how many people know about this?
How many people are talking about this?
It was not a success.
It was a disaster in every way.
You shall have your 24-hour period.
We shall see how we may proceed.

I think that he is right.
Can this be true?
Basically, they have decided to lose.
None of this makes sense.
And we want to talk about credibility?
It was a historic occasion.
It would be a mistake to rush.
The agenda is enormous.
There are two strategies before us.
Once again, I wish you every success.
This has not happened before now.
Thank you very much, Mr Solana.
The debate is closed.
WTO Millennium Round
And quite right!
This should not be the case!
That will be done by my colleagues.
Why the seven core Labour Standards?
This is nothing new!
US domination of the WTO must end.
Only the USA supported it.
This is what it is all about.
Parliament must be fully involved.
That is an illusion!
Finally, a word on China.
But trade is not an end in itself.
It is a means to an end.
(The President cut the speaker off)
What is the truth of the matter?
How can agreements be reached?
I am therefore pragmatic.
Vote
Now there are just four.
We should be pleased with this.
.
Haug report (A5-0052/1999)
We have voted against the Haug report.
I agree with this, in principle.
Averoff report (A5-0055/1999)
Lechner report (A5-0060/1999)
Gebhardt report (A5-0057/1999)
.
Situation in Chechnya

What might this involve?
What about suspending food aid?
The existing scheme is nearing an end.
This is a warning.
Yes, there has been terrorism.
Do we know?
I simply must say this!
We expect the same of the Council.
Rather, we must reach conclusions.
Much points to bogus machinations.
This is a very unusual occurrence.
Just as the others did!
Only them!
Nobody else!
This is the first thing.
This stood out to us.
We have taken up a very clear position.
This is necessary and right!
What investigation confirms this?
So where is the dialogue?
The debate is closed.
WTO Millennium Round (continuation)
Then what will we do?
There should not be winners and losers.
Everyone should win.
It can be made to happen.
How can it be made to happen?
Mr Clegg has already touched upon this.
I can agree with him.
It is called globalisation.
It is electronic capitalism.
Mr Lamy, fish are not shoes or screws.
Free trade is not a dirty word.
It is an immense challenge.
All the more reason to try to succeed.
In the meantime, there are two goals.
It was not straightforward.
We need both: aid as well as trade.
But this is not the only reason.
It is exactly the opposite.
He has presented a good report.
Africa is all too aware of this.
Nevertheless I believe in free trade.
This is not the position we hold.
He has not given me an answer.
May I have an answer?
The debate is closed.
Treaty reform/next IGC
This should also be the case now.
It is a system of open markets.
Thank you, President Sasi.
And what is that line?
Thank you, Mr M√©ndez de Vigo.
We certainly need stirring up.
There is no need.
This was an historic step.
Laws are not sacred cows.
The voters always have the final say.
This idea has widespread support.
It has already taken far too long.
Sometimes I doubt it.
It is a tool.
How should we work?
It must not emerge from it weakened.
Thank you very much, Mrs Maij-Weggen.
I think this is a sound line to take.
Fine.
What is this question?
We must have the courage to ask it.
We can only hope so.
Thank you for that.
Thank you very much, Mrs Palacio.
The debate is closed.
It is absolutely scandalous!
It is unacceptable.
I would like to say...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Rule 112 refers to Rule 60.
I therefore support Mr Dupuis' request.
Mistakes can happen.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0548/99):
(The President cut the speaker off)
Question No 2 by (H-0550/99):
Question No 3 by (H-0557/99):

Its world share of production is 75%.
That is my question.
Question No 4 by (H-0609/99):
I have only praise to give.
Question No 6 by (H-0555/99):
Your answer was interesting.
Question No 7 by (H-0559/99):
"1.
2.
3.
It is a long and difficult process.
What do we know about the situation?

Question No 8 by (H-0564/99):
Forty-three thousand sounds like a lot.
It is what they say that matters.
They are very slow in arriving.
That is still secret.
That is still secret.
There is still a long way to go.
Question No 9 by (H-0563/99):
That is a very disappointing reply.
He was arrested in October 1998.
Question No 10 by (H-0572/99):
This is clear to us all.
I would like to ask a question.
Please answer us that.
We are parliamentarians after all!
Question No 11 by (H-0602/99):
Question No 12 by (H-0576/99):
Thank you very much for your answer.
Question No 13 by (H-0578/99):
Question No 14 by (H-0583/99):
We trust in the wisdom of the Council.
Question No 15 by (H-0585/99):
So, what are your plans?
Have you reached a deadlock?
This is a purely political debate.
Mr Sasi has the floor.
Question No 16 by (H-0586/99):
Please protest on behalf of all of us.
(Loud applause)
Are there any comments?
Very well, Mr Dell' Alba.
That is what I am here for.
I hope that will be corrected.
It is indeed an error.
Thank you, Mr McCartin.
But that does not matter.
(The Minutes were adopted)
Decision on urgent procedure
President.
He said that I was a Stalinist.
That would have been the last straw.
Thank you, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo.
Madam President, I must comment here.
And we keep to our word.
Thank you, Mr Poettering.
But you never know!
Very well, thank you, Mr Dupuis.
Well, we have heard your views.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Agenda
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)

(Applause)
(Applause)
We need the system.
We need the vote today!
This is very generous of you.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Internal OLAF investigations
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 p.m.
Eurodac
What is its purpose?
We need the Eurodac system.
These problems are of two kinds.
(Applause from left)
What is our problem?
Our problem is a constitutional one.
(Applause from left)
There are certain "legal grey areas" .
This is untrue.
A house is built on solid foundations.
And this is not proper.
This is absolutely crucial.
I have two points to make.
What is important is the packaging.
You are welcome to it, is what I say.
In this respect we will stand firm.
Thank you, Mrs Terr√≥n i Cus√≠.
We take note of your request.
We are criminalising victims.
You are making the assumption they are.
That is a tragedy.
Eurodac must of necessity be rejected.
Our position is quite clear.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
EU action plan to combat drugs
The fight against drugs equals war.
Thank you very much, Mrs Corbey.
We have to respond to these challenges.
This must change.
Thank you, Commissioner.
This debate will resume at 6.00 p.m.
Vote
Thank you, Mrs Schreyer.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the decision)
I hope that is clear.
Relating to Amendment No 11
Is that correct?
Have you included that?
Have I understood correctly?
Everyone agreed to that.
I think there is some muddle.
That is the amendment.
We will vote against that amendment.
No other amendment is possible.
I will explain as carefully as I can.
We are ready to vote on that.
We should vote on that.
I am not proposing an oral amendment.
I think that that clears matters up.
The request itself is unclear.
Voting cannot be done √† la carte.
We take good note of this.
Relating to Amendment No 25
Relating to Amendment No 18
Absolutely, Mrs McNally.
Following the vote on paragraph 29
I am terribly sorry.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
This is not right.
It is not a translation problem.
Following the vote on Amendment No 70
The decision is, of course, his.
(Mixed reactions)
Relating to paragraph 17
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
We have to go to Helsinki with this.
We can do this very quickly, in fact.
Count on me!
Relating to Amendment No 3
Is that correct?
Please could he just explain that?
Madam President, may I explain?
It is ridiculous.
I made a mistake.
I was very much against it.
Thank you very much Mrs McKenna.
This list is, alas, far from complete.
- (FR) There is indeed corruption.
Report: Schwaiger (A5-0062/1999)
We come down a notch at every stage.
There are many more possible examples.
That is all very well.
Everyone is agreed on that.
I shall make two observations:
But I doubt that this will be the case.
I am glad they were defeated.
It is time for it to end.
Special, do not even think about it.
This is serious self-delusion.
I think not.
We consider this to be unacceptable.
That is why I voted against it!
Report: Pirker (A5-0059/1999)

Topical and urgent debate
I thank you and await your reply.
I expect rapid action.
There is a serious point to my jesting.
We only have to think about it.
Time, however, is clearly running out.
The joint debate is closed.
East Timor
They do not have an easy task.
The next two years must be won.
The joint debate is closed.
You know the Rules.
Human Rights
Does that seem to us to be sufficient?
Should we not be more demanding?
Should we not be more ambitious?
The answer is yes.
None is.
It is a quote from Genesis.
May nobody touch Cain.
Nobody.
Not even the United States of America.
The death penalty is barbarous.
The second case is that of Abu Jamal.
For the moment he has been spared.
His execution was set for 2 December.
I would go further than Mrs Frassoni.
There is no ambiguity.
Unfortunately not.
Who is to blame?
And that is the disgrace!
Why is that?
And we must help them.
That is the great task before us.
That is certainly a great help.
Why should they?
Alexander Nikitin
Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy.
The debate is closed.
Rwanda/Burundi
This is not acceptable.
What are we doing in response to this?
Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy.
The debate is closed.
Pakistan
They were not appalled.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy.
The debate is closed.
Vote (continuation)
.
.
Chechnya
That concludes the vote.
This is a very important report.
If there are fifty, that will be a lot.
There is no logic behind that.
That is really self-evident.
I personally agree with Mr Prodi.
In fact, that is Europol' s first task.
Nor did we have open borders.
This is really scandalous!
So time then for a change of course.
It is a firm drugs policy.
What is the logic behind it?
The rationale?
What is the issue?
Why?
They desperately need help.
These shattering results are hushed up.
What does this mean?
But action must be taken.
We urgently need such a drug programme.
Giving fine speeches is not enough.
Resources are required.
We need to educate young people.
He deserves our support.
The debate is closed.
Counterfeit travel documents
Why?
The committee did not like that.
Amendment 6 is a disgrace!
But what does the whole debate show us?
I will tell you straight away.
The debate is closed.
Thank you very much!
That' s a huge amount!
Secondly, let me turn to efficacy.
Certainly not.
It makes cooperation more difficult.
The debate is closed.
EIB loans to Turkey
We have often criticised Turkey here.
Turkey has the facilities for doing so.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 7.55 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
Are there any other comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Vote
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
It gives enormous scope.
Thank you for your attention.
This has all been noted, Mr Turco.
Good morning, Mr President.
This is an absolutely essential issue.
(The President cut the speaker off)
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Shipbuilding

There are also critics, however.
Thirdly, Who gets the money?
The shipowners or the shipyards?
Fourthly, Europe needs Korea.
What do you plan to do about this?
My third question is to do with Korea.
The answer seems obvious.
Not a lot, but some.
We have to protect workers' rights.
But what should we do?
Lift those stringent measures?
They were applied for a reason.
Safety must be given priority.
This has to stop.
They were wooden boats.
There is another problem.
I will conclude, Commissioner.
Korea is not the whole problem.
We would do well to keep this in mind!
The debate is closed.
Adjournment of the session
Resumption of the session
Tribute
Thank you, Mrs Doyle.
It is a historic day.
There is still a long way to go.
We too feel her loss greatly.
Thank you.
This is basically all I wanted to say.
That is inadmissible in any Parliament.
So I protest very strongly.
Could I speak, Madam President?
We just cannot continue in this way.
Madam President.
I cannot allow a debate to start.
Quite right, Mr Perry.
Welcome
I therefore welcome them very warmly.
I welcome you very warmly.
(Applause)
Statement by the President
I have one final piece of information.
Agenda
(Parliament approved the proposal)
The rapporteur is Mr Moraes.
The Community and sport
This was not easy, to say the least.
We also have a second plan.
I can give you a very specific example.
Absolutely not.
I have a question for the Commissioner.
The Member is absolutely right.
.
That is plain and clear.
But we failed.
Unfortunately, she is right.
Could, if etc. etc.
Will it happen?
I hope so, I pray so, I dream so.
.
At this point we can do something.
.
Unfortunately, I have no legal basis.
The debate is closed.
What problems are there, then?
Such a decision must be unanimous.
And that will be no easy task.
It cannot even buy a house.
There are numerous other issues too.
We need European defence.
(Applause)
She is to be congratulated on this.
The third issue is Turkey.
What kind of absurdity is this?
I personally am sure of the answer.
This is something they do not want.
Obviously they recognised the risk.
How can it not be?
They are entitled to more.
We should not offer them anything less.
This is simply a fact.
This is now changing, fortunately.
I do not think they belong at all.
We should take a year just to do this.
That is hardly progress.
That is all that counts.
That is not enough.
So far, we have not seen that.
The response was very encouraging.
It is not a minimalist agenda.
Where would these requests end?
Currently, opinions appear to differ.
The debate is closed.
Statement by the President
Annual report on human rights
For this we need the input of the NGOs.
We must be fully prepared for this.
We have to avoid duplicating the work.
But we must also maintain a balance.
There is no room for double standards.
Some will term this selectivity.
Thank you.
The debate is closed.
Turkey

That gives me reason to hope.
All this is still outstanding.
So what is happening today?
And what will our message be?
Everything' s fine?
We have adopted the regulations?
Never mind about √ñ√ßalan?
No.
I just wanted to make that clear.
I repeat, a fundamental change.
I would like to quote just three.
It is not just a symbolic gesture.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I would like to thank Mrs Breyer.
Who can be against that?
It will set new limit values.
We have to follow this very closely.
The debate is closed.
Carbon dioxide emissions from new cars
That needs to be added.
That also needs to be monitored.
The debate is closed.
Our first reading was in 1996.
It is now 1999.
This is of great importance.
This is regrettable.
Why is this?
But Parliament made this concession.
We will not dwell on this any further.
Why did I say this?
Are they explosives or whatever?
Mr President, I too am new.
This is included in the proposal.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Helsinki Convention
There are no major problems.
Discussions to this effect have begun.
That objection still applies.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
This is not a trivial issue.

The Commission is not in favour.
Then we come to Amendment No 7.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
.
I hope the Commission accepts this.
They are distinctive.
This is all positive.
This is still true.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.50 p.m.)
Are there any comments?
He should have given his report.
I shall do so.
Thank you very much, Mrs Theato.
(The Minutes were approved)
Introduction of the Euro
Now, we have other real problems.
Our main proposals are:
The appetite has gone.
This is where the errors arise from.
How will we solve this problem?
Thank you for this report.
The debate is closed.
Fisheries
Something has to change there.
It received a majority vote.
Questions upon questions.
What is more, the EU budget is tight.
That is what we propose.
Nobody produces fish.
The fish are there.
They are a public resource.
I shall refer to two of them briefly.
I accept that there is no easy answer.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Vote
(Parliament approved the joint text)
Marset Campos (GUE/NGL).

That must be the crucial point for us.
None of that is on the agenda today.
Welcome
(Loud applause)

Adjournment of the session
(The sitting closed at 12.25 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
Thank you, Mr Swoboda.
Thank you, Mr Wurtz.
I note your comment.
Thank you, Mr Seguro.
So what is going on?
It would take us the whole night.
I tried, but it was impossible.
I attempted to contact an official.
Thank you, Mr Ceyhun.
Agenda
The next item is the order of business.
Relating to Monday:
(Parliament gave its assent)
I think that is all we can do.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Relating to Thursday: President.
(Parliament gave its assent)
(Parliament approved the request)
These requests are as follows.
He is an old man.
Why is this urgent?
My case rests there.
This is an important issue.
(Parliament rejected the request)
We have achieved a great deal.
Madam President, a point of order.
(Parliament rejected the request)
Do you agree with my proposal?
Do not worry.
I must respect the wishes of the House.
I feel this is perfectly in order.
(Parliament gave its assent)
WTO Millennium Round
Why?
The circumstances are familiar to you.
I take full responsibility for the risk
What are our options?
I can see three possibilities.
(Loud applause)
One general remark if I may.
This must be changed.
We need better decision making.
But let us have no illusions.
That is important to recognise.
The issues themselves were complex.
That is not what we want.
There are good proposals out there.
We need to learn from them.
And we have only just begun.
I spoke to many people on the streets.
What do we learn from this?
How do we make this work?
What platform can we offer for it?
We also need to make this clear.
The time is right to do so!
A third comment on the environment.
Yes, Seattle was a transparent event.
(Loud applause)
Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy.
The debate is closed.
Annual Report of the Court of Auditors
There has also been a suspension.
This is very serious.
That clearly needs to be reformed.
I genuinely welcome these reports.
That is amazing, to say the least.
I regret this just as much as Mr Staes.
I think we must go ahead.
The first is activity-based budgeting.
Who ought to have acted differently?
This is, of course, not true.
The debate is closed.
Socrates (second phase)
I am proud that we have achieved this.
I am proud of this.
This is the first contradiction.
What do I mean by this?
Precisely the opposite is true.
However, our job does not finish there.
Yes, you heard me correctly.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
.
Secondly, the financial burden.
I find this behaviour extraordinary.
This is incredible!
The EU can be the forerunner here.
Is it?
This buck-passing game has to stop!
The debate is closed.
Is it just routine then?
Not for me!
Parliament has adopted it.
In my opinion, this is catastrophic.
The debate is closed.
We can be proud of this directive.
What is it about?
Why not indeed?
That is all.
The truth is different.
They are in favour of this solution.
It is untenable.
We should not forget that!
It offers some security.
It is important for another reason.
So tell me where the problem is.
This is what happens in practice.
They should use that opportunity!
.
This is quite something.
This is not intended, of course.
I will run through them very quickly.
The debate is closed.
Heavy goods vehicles in Switzerland
What are we talking about here?
We need to be aware of this.
That is what this is all about.
Why do we need basic allocations?
No, of course that cannot be the case!
I believe that this is unacceptable.
This is what has happened here.
The negotiations were long and hard.
Let us do away with it!
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Substances that deplete the ozone layer
That is not the case!
We need to solve both problems.
I would ask the Commission why.
What is behind this U-turn?
It affects water, air and people.
The time is ripe for a ban.
I do not wish to repeat it all.
It is Amendment No 34.
Halons are very dangerous.
We must give it our support.
But the choices are not simple.
We know what we need to do.
I wish to stress the word "realistic".
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The consumer has a right to know.
I will support that.
But how practical is it?
Is it going to work?
That will be what happens.
We are making a brave attempt here.
How is this evidenced?
You also require proof.
I am wondering how this is done.
This is one percent.
Or is this not permitted?
Or have I got this wrong?
Where and when will you check this?
So why is it 1%?
This is how we would put it informally.

I wonder when the rest will surface.
Whatever will we be faced with next?
It is a very challenging target.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.15 a.m.)
Resumption of the sitting
Vote on requests for urgent procedure
Secondly, we agree with the objective.
President.
I am very sorry, Mr Colom i Naval.
Indeed, it is one of my objectives.
Could this be rectified?
Let me take these in order.
Second, defence.
The discussions we had were fruitful.
The year is nearly over.
But that should only affect Russia.
Europe needs to grow together now.
The possibility!
(Applause)
The same applies in the other groups.
But actions speak louder than words.
(Applause)
Why?
These are very important decisions.
Matters need not reach this pass.
We very much doubt it.
What is our common European culture?
This is the status of NGO.
This is no longer the scenario.
We can delude ourselves.
My first example is the IGC.
That will not be an easy task.
They are all issues we have in common.
Where did sport get to at the Summit?
Here new ideas can be put forward.
.
(Applause)
That is the situation.
I, for one, do not know.
I am afraid the answer is no.
Other Helsinki matters took precedence.
Together we can achieve a great deal.
Turkey is a candidate.
But the reverse is of course true.
No other way forward is possible.
But we cannot do the work for Turkey.
In fact it has only just begun.
I would disagree with Mrs Maij-Weggen.
We can do so quite independently.
Allow me to make one last comment.
And this is what concerns us.
I consider that a very risky statement.
The debate is closed.
2000 budget
and on
180 and 20 make 200.
So, what is the position?
I have no idea!
Will you be making proposals to us?
Well, we are after five things.
What is the state of play?
So, the question remains.
The estimates are not serious ones.
Such were the terms of the compromise.
Will it be done? Will you do it?
I have no idea.
This is what we are doing.
This is the scenario we envisage.
No, it is a task for today.
We are happy to support him in that.
On the whole we are satisfied.
I would however make one final plea.
Something must be done quickly.
I have time to make only two points.
We shall now proceed to the debate.
Mr President, I shall be brief.
Mr Marinos, just a brief observation.
They cannot understand road signs.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Commission)
First Part
Question No 34 by (H-0689/99):
Question No 35 by (H-0670/99):
We are all waiting for an answer.
The total cost is what it is.
We must go beyond the Prague mandate.
Questions to Mr Kinnock
Question No 38 by (H-0728/99):
In short, progress is being made.
We are working on that.
.
Questions to Mr Patten
President.
Question No 40 by (H-0683/99):


This is unacceptable.
What will you focus on?
.
Question No 41 by (H-0704/99):
.
A good deal has in fact been done.
This is the second purpose.
.
They represent a valuable way forward.
Question No 42 by (H-0746/99):
Commissioner, thank you for your reply.
.
We will go on doing so.
He seemed to welcome that prospect.
Question No 48 by (H-0677/99):
Question No 49 by (H-0684/99):
The Commissioner has the floor.
Question No 50 by (H-0688/99):

Would that not help?
Question No 52 by (H-0693/99):

Statement by the President
These people have homes to go to!
President.
2000 budget (continuation)
Please do not do so again.
It represents a gesture.
It was not easy this year.
This does not seem to bear repetition.
My group is divided on this matter.
It is a rather awkward situation.
The first concerns Kosovo.
You stand to gain on this ground too.
Agriculture is a perfect example.
We cannot accept that.
Let me say this: we have no problem.
You do.
We know that.
But that is another matter.
Let me try and simplify it.
Let me say one last thing.
But this is not in the offing as yet.
How can this be financed?
This is also true of the Balkans.
That too is a very important point.
I wonder where I am going wrong.
The figures are confused.
This clearly has to be resolved.
New policies need new resources.
My congratulations!
They say that new brooms sweep clean.
That should give us food for thought.
Does that answer your question Mr Wynn?
Mr Wynn asked a specific question.
I do not see anything vague here.
We are working on this.
Thank you, Madam Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
I think we are making good progress.
That will be considered at the IGC.
Thank you very much, Mr Casaca.
The debate is closed.
There never has been.
We are doing this.
I would much prefer it to be otherwise.
That is my very strong, committed view.
Russian policy must change.
That certainly is not the intention.
I should like to make one last point.
That depends on both sides moving.
It is very much a two-way street.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
May I say, that is not quite in order.
You referred to the House of Commons.
The debate is closed.
.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 11.35 p.m.)
Statement by the President
This was revealed after it was found.
Mr President, you are quite right.
Thank you, Mr Poos.
Welcome
Climate change
Thank you, Mrs Hassi.
What will this entail?


I personally am not so optimistic.
The debate is closed.
Situation in Macao
We all run our course.
This must continue.
They have not been consulted. Why not?
Thank you, Commissioner Patten.
The debate is closed.
Beijing Action Platform
(B5-0035/99) by Mrs Theorin and
(B5-0037/99) by Mrs Theorin
We committed ourselves to 12 areas.
The first area is poverty.
The second area is education.
The third area is health.
The fourth area is violence.
The fifth area is armed conflict.
Decision making is the seventh area.
Women's human rights is the ninth area.
The tenth area is media.
The eleventh area is environment.
Women are reacting, however.
That was the happy experience.
Time is running out.
We need a straight answer here today.
Thank you, Mrs Gr√∂ner.
I find this unacceptable.
(Loud applause)
Vote
The next item is the vote.
Procedure without report (Rule 158):

Procedure without debate (Rule 114):
(Parliament approved the joint text)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I am very grateful to Parliament.
(Parliament adopted the decision)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Joint motion for resolution on Chechnya
No it is not!
(The President cut the speaker off)
We are not having a debate on this.
We are moving to the vote.
The House has made its decision.
We are not discussing it.
(Mixed reactions)
Joint motion for resolution on the OSCE
Otherwise, please sit down.
Take your seat.
Take your seat.
Sit down!
It is as simple as that.
I want, at this stage...
Oh, just a minute!
Sit down!
(Loud and sustained applause)
Motion for resolution on climate change
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
That is my first point.
We will ensure that is changed.
That concludes the vote.

GMO (B5-0313/1999)
Chechnya
Climate change

Today I will just mention two points.
What actually happened?
Beijing Action Platform (continuation)
The answer is no.
I think that is incredibly sad.
Attention has now waned.
We must therefore be precise.
But hang on.
What about the European Union?
All three are particularly important.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Ban on British beef and veal
Thank you for your attention.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Now to what Mr Goepel said.
It is far too important.
I am not sure about that.
It makes no sense!
This is very interesting.
The Council should therefore be here.
I have a proposal to make.
We know the arguments.
I therefore support the motion.
That is not possible if he is not here.
We know nothing about these particles.
The British Members are upset.
Do 32 Members support this proposal?
You have not allowed us to vote.
Mr Langen, I acknowledge my mistake.
I should have put it to the vote.
Like most of you, I am no scientist.
The Council is usually pretty dozy.
British farmers are fed up.
We are right to be careful.
Is selling or living more important?
Well, we do not want to die.
(The President cut the speaker off)
This is simply not acceptable.
So what went wrong after that?
What happened as a result of that?
It is unanimously in one direction.
Let us endorse it".
Nobody, I think, sensibly does.
His job is to be an honest broker.
I believe he is trying to do it.
This is an extremely important debate.
Quite frankly, this is unacceptable.
We know that it is extremely difficult.
I fully share this point of view.
We understand.
Let me say this.
That is not correct.
They also complied with that request.
That also was a valuable exercise.
It is still my intention to do that.
Progress has been made.
It is not a public health issue.
All of this takes time.
He asked me to deal with this.
I expect that to happen on 12 January.
It is an unthinkable proposition.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
Mr President, this is a point of order.
Mrs Jackson has the floor.
Mr Langen, the agenda has been set.
Question No 1 by (H-0668/99):
Question No 2 by (H-0671/99):
Question No 3 by (H-0673/99):
Question No 4 by (H-0674/99):
The one exception is France.
You have suggested it already.
Question No 5 by (H-0678/99):
We cannot judge the parties equally.
We ask Europe to become more involved.
Thank you very much, Mrs Siimes.
Question No 6 by (H-0679/99):
Is the Council aware of this?
Question No 7 by (H-0685/99):
Thank you very much, Mr Korakas.
Question No 8 by (H-0694/99):
I do want to address the Council.
Thank you very much, Mrs Siimes.
Question No 9 by (H-0697/99):
Thank you very much, Mr Mart√≠nez.
In fact, it was a question.
Question No 10 by (H-0699/99):
Question No 11 by (H-0703/99):
Thank you for your reply.
Question No 12 by (H-0706/99):
Mrs Siimes has the floor.
State aid and competition policy
Thank you very much, Mr Karas.
(Parliament approved the request)
Late payment in commercial transactions
I could not agree more.
We do not intend to protect anyone.
This is unacceptable.
The report meets with my full approval.
We need a lively, growing SME sector.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
It says so.
That too is a Council decision.
We approved Regulation No 820 in 1997.
As yet, nothing has been approved.
Why?
This is not good enough.
I do not believe it is good enough.
Everyone has made an effort!
We negotiated with the Commission.
The result: do or die!
Now to the role of the Commission.
Please, indulge us!
Consumer interests must come first.
Even a one year delay is.
Let this be a warning to the Council.
We will take a hard line on this.
We must certainly not forget them.
Who are the pressure groups?
Only three have chosen to do so.
I do not accept it.
I think you misunderstood what I said.
These are not insults, Commissioner.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
BST
The numbers speak for themselves.
BST is also rejected by consumers.
That cannot be!
Exports would also suffer.
We know that.
That is to say, we support Article 1.
We have agreed on Amendment No 3.
(Loud applause)
(Loud applause)
(Loud applause)
(Sustained applause)
Are there any comments?
We will be very careful about this.
(The Minutes were approved)
Vote
Thank you, Mr Fabra Vall√©s.
We wish you good luck.
(Applause)
We should vote.
I agree.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Thank you, Commissioner.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Absolutely, Mr Papayannakis.
Please indicate your position.
A decision must therefore be made.
I completely agree.
You can rely on me, Mrs Jackson.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Before the vote on the budgetPresident.
Mrs Siimes, please make your statement.
(Loud applause)
Thank you, Mr Bourlanges.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
They are Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 9.
Thank you, we will note this.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Thank you, Mr Bourlanges.
Thank you, Mr Virrankoski.
I shall be brief.
